A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, enabling the sheep to recover while still maintaining enough hunting to support wolf reproduction. This adjustment is necessary to avoid depleting the sheep further and to ensure long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and with the wolf population being relatively high, it is wise to focus on reducing competition among wolves while allowing the sheep to recover. A moderate theta value will help maintain a balance and prevent overhunting, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while preventing overexploitation. This approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while reducing pressure on their population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence and avoids sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta allows for more focus on reducing competition and giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
