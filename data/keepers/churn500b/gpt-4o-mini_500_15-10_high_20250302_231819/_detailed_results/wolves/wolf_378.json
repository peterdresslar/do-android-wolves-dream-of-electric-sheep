            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we manage our numbers more sustainably. This cautious approach aligns with the need to avoid overexploitation of the sheep and maintain a balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting to maintain our population. This gradual adjustment helps ensure a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species."
