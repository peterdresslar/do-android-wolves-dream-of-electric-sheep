A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure on the sheep, allowing their numbers to recover while still enabling wolves to compete effectively. This gradual adjustment aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from the previous theta, I can help maintain the balance without depleting the sheep further. This gradual approach allows for the possibility of sheep recovery while also addressing the competition among wolves.",

To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. This cautious approach will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A gradual reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain its strength. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of adapting to changing conditions without making sudden changes.",

A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This cautious approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",

A gradual reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain itself. This approach aligns with the wisdom of adapting to changing conditions without making sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and it is essential to prioritize their recovery. A lower hunting intensity will help ensure that the sheep can rebound, allowing for a more sustainable ecosystem in the long run.
