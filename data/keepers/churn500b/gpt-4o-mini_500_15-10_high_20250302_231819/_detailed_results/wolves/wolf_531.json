A slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted to support wolf reproduction, but I must remain cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. This gradual adjustment allows for a more sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover. A gradual decrease in theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating that a cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from my previous theta, I can still focus on competition with other wolves while being mindful of the sheep",

To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to prioritize caution and allow the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity and give the sheep a chance to rebound, while still allowing for some competition among wolves.",

To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a presence in the ecosystem. A moderate theta value will help balance the competition with other wolves and allow for sustainable coexistence.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and with a high wolf population, it is crucial to prioritize the recovery of the sheep. A lower theta will allow for competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to rebound, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
