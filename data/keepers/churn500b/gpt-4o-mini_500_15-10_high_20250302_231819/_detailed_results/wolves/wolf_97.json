            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 101\n- Sheep population: 35.16\n- Wolf population: 27.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.200\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 1.30 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 3.5% of maximum capacity\n\nEcosystem observations:\n- The wolf population is moderately high.\n- Sheep numbers are becoming concerning, suggesting caution may be needed.\n- The ratio of sheep to wolves is becoming less favorable, which may require adaptation.\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution in hunting. A moderate theta allows for some hunting to support reproduction while also giving sheep a chance to recover. This balance is crucial for the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting to maintain our population. This gradual adjustment helps ensure long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. By focusing on lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while managing the wolf population sustainably. This approach aligns with the need for caution in the current ecosystem state.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need to focus on competition among wolves rather than hunting sheep. This will allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a sustainable wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This gradual adjustment helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating that competition among wolves is increasing. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure on the sheep, allowing their numbers to recover while we manage our own population dynamics more sustainably.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need to prioritize competition among wolves to allow the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity, I can help sustain my pack while allowing the sheep to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining balance in the ecosystem.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover while also being cautious about the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach helps maintain balance without risking a crash in either population."
