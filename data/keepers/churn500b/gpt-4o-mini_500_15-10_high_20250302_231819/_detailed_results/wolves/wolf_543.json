A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This cautious approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating that we need to focus on reducing competition among wolves while allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual increase from my previous theta will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure on the sheep, allowing their numbers to recover while still maintaining a focus on competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment is crucial for long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A lower theta will allow sheep to recover while we manage our numbers more sustainably. This gradual adjustment helps avoid overhunting and promotes long-term balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. By reducing hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while managing competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
