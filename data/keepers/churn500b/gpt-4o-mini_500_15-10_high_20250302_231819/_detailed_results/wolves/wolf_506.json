A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance without risking a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure on the sheep, allowing their numbers to recover while we manage our own population dynamics. This cautious approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence.",
