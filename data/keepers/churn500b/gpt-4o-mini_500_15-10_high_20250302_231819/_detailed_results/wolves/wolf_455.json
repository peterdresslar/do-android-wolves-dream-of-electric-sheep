            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while my previous high hunting intensity helped in the past, it is now crucial to balance hunting with the need for sheep recovery. A moderate theta allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some hunting to support the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still providing sustenance for the wolves, ensuring a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain their numbers. This approach helps to avoid over-depletion of the sheep and supports a more sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. By focusing on competition rather than intense hunting, I can allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a sustainable wolf population. This gradual adjustment will help ensure long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need to reduce hunting intensity to allow sheep to recover while managing competition among wolves. A gradual decrease in theta will help maintain balance and prevent overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta allows for a focus on reducing competition and giving sheep a chance to recover. This approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence and avoids depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This cautious approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
