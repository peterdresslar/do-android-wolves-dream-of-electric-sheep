            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is relatively high, indicating increased competition. A moderate hunting intensity will allow for some sheep recovery while still enabling wolves to sustain themselves. This approach balances the immediate need for food with the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is relatively high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while ensuring that the wolf population does not deplete the sheep too quickly. This approach supports sustainable coexistence and avoids drastic changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is concerningly low, and the wolf population is relatively high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while also preventing further depletion of their numbers, ensuring a more sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help the sheep recover while also managing competition among wolves. This approach aligns with the goal of ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A lower theta will allow sheep to recover while reducing pressure on our own population. This cautious approach helps ensure long-term survival for both species.",
