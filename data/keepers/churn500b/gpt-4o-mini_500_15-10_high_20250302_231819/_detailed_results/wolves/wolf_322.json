            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a balance and ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is relatively high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This gradual adjustment will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This cautious approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta allows for a focus on reducing competition and giving the sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while reducing the pressure on their population, ensuring a more sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while managing competition among wolves. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta allows for reduced hunting intensity, giving the sheep a chance to recover while we manage our numbers more sustainably.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still providing some sustenance for the wolves. This approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence and avoids depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a sustainable wolf population. This gradual adjustment will help prevent a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is quite low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while managing the wolf population. A gradual decrease in theta will help maintain balance without sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A lower theta allows for more focus on reducing competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach helps maintain balance and prevents overexploitation."
