This moderate value helps ensure sustainable coexistence without depleting the sheep further.",

This approach balances the immediate need for food with the long-term sustainability of both species.",

To allow the sheep to recover and avoid depleting their numbers further, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensifying hunting. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating that competition among wolves is increasing. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach aims to maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. By reducing hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while managing competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",

To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep to recover. This cautious approach will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and a cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from the previous theta, I can still focus on competition with other wolves while being mindful of the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover. A gradual decrease in theta will help maintain a balance while avoiding sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",

By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from the previous theta, I can help maintain a balance while allowing the sheep to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of avoiding sudden changes and responding to the current state of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating that a cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep while still allowing for some competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species and maintains a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating that a cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while ensuring the sheep have the opportunity to rebound, which is crucial for the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and it is crucial to prioritize their recovery to ensure long-term sustainability. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help the sheep population stabilize while maintaining a healthy wolf pack.",
