This will allow the sheep to recover while ensuring that our pack does not overexploit the remaining resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is relatively high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A theta of 0.30 allows me to focus on reducing competition while giving the sheep a chance to recover without depleting their numbers further. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep further and to ensure long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and with a high wolf population, competition is increasing. A lower theta allows for a focus on reducing competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover. This approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence and avoids depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure on the sheep, allowing their numbers to recover while we adapt to the current conditions. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover while managing the wolf population sustainably.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity, I can help ensure the survival of both species while allowing the sheep to recover. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance in the ecosystem."
