            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating that a cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while avoiding further depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and a more cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep while still allowing for some competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to recover. This approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, as we need to avoid depleting the sheep further while still competing with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low at 9.1% of maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while still competing with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for long-term sustainability.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and I need to prioritize their recovery while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our wolf population. A moderate approach will help ensure sustainability without risking a crash in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and it is crucial to prioritize their recovery. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both sheep and wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize while we compete with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and a cautious approach is needed to allow them to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while ensuring the sheep have the opportunity to increase their numbers. This balance is crucial for the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low at only 13% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensifying hunting. This will allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a sustainable balance.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This gradual approach helps ensure long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting to maintain our population. This gradual adjustment helps ensure long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow sheep to recover while we manage our numbers more sustainably. This cautious approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a sustainable wolf population. This gradual adjustment helps avoid overexploitation of the sheep and supports long-term balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure on the sheep, allowing their numbers to recover while we manage our own population dynamics. This cautious approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta allows for a focus on reducing competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
