A moderate theta value will help us find a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain their numbers. This balance is crucial for the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. By reducing hunting intensity, I can help the sheep recover while also managing competition among wolves. This moderate approach allows for a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the current wolf population is high, leading to increased competition, and the sheep population is low, indicating a need for caution in hunting. A lower theta allows the sheep to recover while we manage our numbers more sustainably.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a sustainable wolf population. This gradual adjustment helps prevent overhunting and supports long-term balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while reducing pressure on their dwindling numbers. This cautious approach aligns with the need for long-term sustainability and balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population.
