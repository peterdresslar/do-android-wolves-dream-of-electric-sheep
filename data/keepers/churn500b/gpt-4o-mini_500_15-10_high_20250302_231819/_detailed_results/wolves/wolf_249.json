            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 236\n- Sheep population: 39.48\n- Wolf population: 70.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.200\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.56 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 3.9% of maximum capacity\n\nEcosystem observations:\n- The wolf population is quite high, which may lead to increased competition.\n- Sheep numbers are becoming concerning, suggesting caution may be needed.\n- The ratio of sheep to wolves is becoming less favorable, which may require adaptation.\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating a need for caution. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a healthy wolf population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to recover. This approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, maintaining a balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and a cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while ensuring that the sheep have a chance to rebound, which is crucial for the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. With the wolf population being moderately high, focusing on competition with other wolves will help maintain balance without further depleting the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating that competition among wolves is increasing. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling us to maintain our numbers. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure on the sheep, allowing their numbers to recover while we manage our own population dynamics more sustainably.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta allows for a focus on reducing competition and giving sheep a chance to recover, while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population. This gradual adjustment helps ensure long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments to ensure long-term survival for both species.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. By reducing hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. This approach supports long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating that competition among wolves is increasing. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity, allowing the sheep population to recover while we navigate the current high competition among ourselves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance."
