            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and the wolf population is quite high, leading to increased competition. A moderate hunting intensity will allow for some sheep recovery while still enabling wolves to thrive. This balance is crucial for long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A moderate hunting intensity will allow sheep to recover while still providing enough sustenance for the wolf pack. This approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence and avoids depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This cautious approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta allows the sheep to recover while we focus on stabilizing our own numbers. This gradual approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover while managing the wolf population sustainably.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is quite low, and the current wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance and avoids depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need to focus on reducing competition among wolves rather than intensifying hunting. This will allow the sheep to recover and help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is quite low at 3.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution in hunting. With a high wolf population, competition is likely to increase, so a lower theta will help reduce pressure on the sheep and allow their numbers to recover while still maintaining some hunting activity.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. This cautious approach will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is moderately high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while still competing with other wolves. A gradual increase from my previous theta will help maintain balance without causing drastic changes.",

To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted to support wolf reproduction, but I must remain cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. This gradual adjustment allows for a more sustainable balance.",
