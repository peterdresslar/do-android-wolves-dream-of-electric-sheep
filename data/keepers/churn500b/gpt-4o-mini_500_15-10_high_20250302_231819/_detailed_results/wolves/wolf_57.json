A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity, allowing the sheep to recover while we manage our numbers more sustainably. This gradual adjustment aligns with the need for balance in the ecosystem.",

A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity, allowing the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our own numbers. This gradual adjustment aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling wolves to sustain themselves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem."
