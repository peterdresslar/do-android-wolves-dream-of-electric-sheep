            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and the wolf population is relatively high. A moderate hunting intensity will allow for some sheep recovery while still enabling the wolf pack to sustain itself. This approach balances the immediate need for food with the long-term goal of maintaining both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our own numbers. This gradual adjustment helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",

By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This cautious approach aligns with the need for balance in the ecosystem.",

By slightly increasing my hunting intensity, I can help support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 2.9% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure on the sheep, allowing them to recover while we manage our own numbers more sustainably."
