A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure on the sheep, allowing their numbers to recover while still addressing the competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 2.9% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while reducing the pressure on our own population. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",

A lower theta allows for more focus on reducing competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment helps maintain a sustainable balance.",
