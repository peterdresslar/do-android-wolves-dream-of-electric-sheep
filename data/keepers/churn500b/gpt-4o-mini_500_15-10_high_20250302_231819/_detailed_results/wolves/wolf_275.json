            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A moderate hunting intensity allows for a balanced approach, enabling sheep to recover while still ensuring the wolf pack can sustain itself. This adjustment is necessary to avoid depleting the sheep further and to maintain a healthy ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to sustain themselves. This approach helps maintain balance in the ecosystem without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. By lowering the hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. This moderate approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we manage our numbers more sustainably. This cautious approach aligns with the need to maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while reducing pressure on our own population. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance and ensures long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This cautious approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence and avoids depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is quite low at 39.48, which is only 3.9% of its maximum capacity. With the wolf population being relatively high at 70, increasing competition among wolves is likely. A lower theta allows for a focus on reducing competition and giving the sheep a chance to recover, while still maintaining some hunting to support our population. This gradual adjustment will help ensure a sustainable balance.",

            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance and avoids over-depletion of sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep. By reducing my hunting intensity further, I can help ensure that the sheep population has a chance to rebound, which will ultimately benefit the wolf population in the long run. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
