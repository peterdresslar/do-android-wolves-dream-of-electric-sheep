A moderate theta allows for some hunting to support reproduction while also giving sheep a chance to recover. This approach helps maintain a balance between both populations.",

            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow sheep to recover while we manage our numbers more sustainably. This cautious approach aligns with the need to ensure long-term survival for both species.",

A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity, allowing the sheep to recover while we manage our own numbers more sustainably.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is quite low at 44.12, which is only 4.4% of its maximum capacity. Given the high wolf population of 64, increasing competition among wolves is likely. A lower theta allows for a focus on reducing competition and giving the sheep a chance to recover, while still allowing for some hunting to maintain wolf reproduction. This gradual adjustment helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",

A slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted to support wolf reproduction, but I must remain cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further.
