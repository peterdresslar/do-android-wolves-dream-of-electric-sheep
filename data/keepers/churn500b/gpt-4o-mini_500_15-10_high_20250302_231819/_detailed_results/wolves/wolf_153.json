            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 144\n- Sheep population: 26.53\n- Wolf population: 40.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.250\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.66 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 2.7% of maximum capacity\n\nEcosystem observations:\n- The wolf population is quite high, which may lead to increased competition.\n- Sheep numbers are becoming concerning, suggesting caution may be needed.\n- The ratio of sheep to wolves is becoming less favorable, which may require adaptation.\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is relatively high, indicating a need to focus on reducing competition among wolves while allowing the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A moderate hunting intensity will help prevent further depletion of the sheep while allowing for some hunting to support wolf reproduction. This approach aims for a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta allows for more focus on reducing competition and giving the sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A moderate hunting intensity allows for some hunting while giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we manage our numbers more sustainably. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating that competition among wolves is increasing. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure on the sheep, allowing their numbers to recover while we focus on maintaining our own population stability.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach helps maintain balance and avoids over-depletion of resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain their numbers. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need to focus on reducing competition among wolves rather than intensifying hunting. This will allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 2.8% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while managing competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. A gradual reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. This approach supports long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while managing competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance."
