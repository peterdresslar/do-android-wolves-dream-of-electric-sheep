            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 55\n- Sheep population: 41.91\n- Wolf population: 26.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.250\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 1.61 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 4.2% of maximum capacity\n\nEcosystem observations:\n- The wolf population is moderately high.\n- Sheep numbers are becoming concerning, suggesting caution may be needed.\n- The ratio of sheep to wolves is becoming less favorable, which may require adaptation.\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution in hunting. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while also enabling sheep to recover, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This gradual adjustment helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a presence in the ecosystem. This gradual adjustment helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain its health. This approach supports long-term sustainability and avoids drastic changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta allows the sheep to recover while we focus on stabilizing our own numbers. This gradual adjustment will help prevent a crash in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating that increased competition among wolves could be detrimental. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while managing the wolf population sustainably.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating that a more cautious approach is needed to allow their numbers to recover. While the wolf population is moderately high, maintaining a balance is crucial to avoid depleting the sheep further. A gradual increase in hunting intensity can be considered later if sheep numbers improve.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This cautious approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable.
