            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. A moderate theta of 0.55 strikes a balance between hunting and ensuring the sustainability of both sheep and wolves, allowing for gradual adjustments as conditions change.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while the wolf population is moderately high, I need to prioritize the long-term survival of both species. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some reproduction among wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is relatively high, indicating increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while reducing pressure on the wolf population. This approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence and avoids depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This approach aligns with the need for caution in our current ecosystem state.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need to prioritize competition among wolves to allow sheep to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This gradual adjustment will help ensure long-term sustainability for both species.",
