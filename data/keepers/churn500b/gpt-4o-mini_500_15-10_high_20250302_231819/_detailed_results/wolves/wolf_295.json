            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 248\n- Sheep population: 33.03\n- Wolf population: 21.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.300\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 1.57 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 3.3% of maximum capacity\n\nEcosystem observations:\n- Sheep numbers are becoming concerning, suggesting caution may be needed.\n- The ratio of sheep to wolves is becoming less favorable, which may require adaptation.\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population.

            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity, I can help sustain the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 2.9% of its maximum capacity, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent further depletion of the sheep.",
