A moderate theta value will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both sheep and wolves, while still maintaining a moderate level of competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still ensuring that the sheep population has a chance to stabilize and grow.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while managing the wolf population sustainably.",

A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance and avoids overexploitation.",
