A moderate theta of 0.65 strikes a balance between hunting and ensuring the sustainability of both sheep and wolves, allowing for gradual adjustments as conditions change.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while my previous theta allowed for some hunting, it is now crucial to adopt a more balanced approach. This moderate value will help ensure the sheep can recover while still allowing for some hunting to maintain the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and the wolf population is relatively high, indicating increased competition. A lower theta allows for a focus on reducing competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is concerningly low, and with a high wolf population, competition is likely to increase. By focusing on reducing hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",

A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we manage our numbers more sustainably. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This gradual adjustment helps ensure long-term sustainability for both species.",

A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach helps maintain balance and avoids over-depletion of sheep.",
