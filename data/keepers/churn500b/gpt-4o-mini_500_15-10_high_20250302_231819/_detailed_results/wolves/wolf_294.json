            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution in hunting. A moderate theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while also giving sheep a chance to recover. This balance is crucial for the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A moderate hunting intensity will allow for some sheep recovery while still enabling the wolf pack to thrive. This approach balances the immediate need for food with the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta allows for more focus on reducing competition and giving the sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our own numbers. This cautious approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we manage our own numbers. This gradual adjustment will help maintain balance in the ecosystem.",

A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our own numbers.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 2.9% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta allows for a focus on reducing competition among wolves, giving sheep a chance to recover without further depleting their numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. With the current sheep population at only 3.0% of its maximum capacity, it is crucial to prioritize the recovery of sheep to ensure long-term sustainability. A lower theta allows for competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to rebound.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population.
