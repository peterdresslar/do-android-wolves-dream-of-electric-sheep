A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach that can help the sheep recover while still enabling the wolves to thrive. This adjustment also considers the current unfavorable sheep-to-wolf ratio, promoting sustainable coexistence.",

A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we manage our numbers more sustainably. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance in the ecosystem.",

A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting to sustain the wolf population. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance and prevents a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is quite low at 27.92, which is only 2.8% of its maximum capacity. With the wolf population at 49.00, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable, indicating that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover.
