            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and with the current high wolf population, it is crucial to focus on reducing competition among wolves. This lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta allows the sheep to recover while we focus on reducing competition among wolves. This approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence and avoids depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow sheep to recover while preventing overhunting, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This gradual adjustment helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we manage our own numbers. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while reducing the pressure on our own population. This cautious approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating that competition among wolves is increasing. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence and avoids depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need to reduce hunting intensity to allow sheep to recover. A lower theta will help balance the ecosystem and prevent overexploitation of the sheep, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we manage our numbers more sustainably. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance in the ecosystem."
