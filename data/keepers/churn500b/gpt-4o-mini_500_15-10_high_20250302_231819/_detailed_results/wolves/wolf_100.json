            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A moderate hunting intensity will allow for some sheep recovery while still enabling wolves to thrive. This balance is crucial for the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and the wolf population is relatively high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we manage our numbers more sustainably. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is relatively high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while preventing overhunting, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on reducing competition among wolves. This approach aligns with the need for long-term sustainability and avoids depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we manage our numbers more sustainably. This cautious approach aligns with the need to maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity, allowing the sheep to recover while we manage our own numbers. This gradual adjustment aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. By reducing hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while managing competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need to focus on reducing competition among wolves while allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual increase from my previous theta will help maintain balance without overwhelming the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need to focus on reducing competition among wolves rather than intensifying hunting. This will allow the sheep to recover and help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating that competition among wolves is increasing. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This gradual adjustment helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. This cautious approach will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance and avoids depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. A gradual decrease in theta will help maintain balance without causing drastic changes."
