            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will allow sheep to recover while reducing pressure on the wolf population. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 2.9% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while reducing pressure on their dwindling numbers. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach aims to maintain balance and avoid over-depletion of sheep, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable.
