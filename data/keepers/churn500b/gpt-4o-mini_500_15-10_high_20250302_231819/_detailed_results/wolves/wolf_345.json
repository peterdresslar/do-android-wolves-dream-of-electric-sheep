            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain their numbers. This approach helps ensure a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure on the sheep, allowing their numbers to recover while we manage our own population dynamics more sustainably.",

A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This gradual adjustment will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",

A lower hunting intensity will allow sheep to recover while also preventing overpopulation of wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is quite low at only 39.34, which is concerning for the long-term sustainability of both species. With the wolf population being relatively high at 74.00, it is crucial to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help ensure that we do not deplete the sheep further while still maintaining a presence in the ecosystem.",
