A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting to maintain our population. This approach aligns with the need for a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and promotes long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on stabilizing our own numbers. This gradual approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the current wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while reducing pressure on the wolf population. This gradual adjustment is essential to ensure long-term sustainability and avoid potential crashes in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach helps maintain balance and avoids overexploitation.",

With the wolf population at 37.00, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable at 0.74. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help achieve this balance.",

A slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted to support reproduction, but I must remain cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. This gradual adjustment allows for potential recovery of the sheep population while still considering the current high wolf numbers.",
