A lower theta allows for more competition among wolves, which can help reduce our numbers slightly while giving sheep a chance to rebound. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and maintaining balance in the ecosystem.",

A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain their numbers. This approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence and avoids putting further pressure on the already dwindling sheep population.",
