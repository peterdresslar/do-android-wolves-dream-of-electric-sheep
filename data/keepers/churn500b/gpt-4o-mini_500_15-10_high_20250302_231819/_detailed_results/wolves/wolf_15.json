            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 25\n- Sheep population: 94.08\n- Wolf population: 9.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.625\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 10.45 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 9.4% of maximum capacity\n\nEcosystem observations:\n- The wolf population is relatively low, which may present opportunities for growth.\n- Sheep numbers are becoming concerning, suggesting caution may be needed.\n- There are many sheep per wolf, suggesting the ecosystem could support more hunting.\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, indicating that a moderate increase in hunting intensity is necessary to prevent overpopulation and ensure sustainability. However, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep too quickly, as the wolf population is still low and needs to grow. A theta of 0.55 allows for a balanced approach that supports both wolf reproduction and sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that a more cautious approach is needed to allow their numbers to recover. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while maintaining a healthy balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This gradual adjustment helps ensure long-term balance in the ecosystem.",

A moderate hunting intensity will allow sheep to recover while also preventing overpopulation of wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",

A lower theta allows for reduced hunting pressure on sheep, giving them a chance to recover while still maintaining a focus on competition among wolves. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we manage our numbers more sustainably. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",

A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our own numbers. This gradual adjustment will help create a more sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is quite low, and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance without risking a crash.",
