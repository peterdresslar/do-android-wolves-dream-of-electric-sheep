A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the need for caution in the current ecosystem state.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and a cautious approach is necessary to allow them to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while ensuring the sheep have a chance to stabilize and grow. This aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and sustainable coexistence.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep while still allowing for some competition among wolves.",

This approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species and maintains a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low at only 11.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to prioritize caution and focus on reducing competition with other wolves rather than intensifying hunting. This will allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution in hunting. While the wolf population is moderately high, I want to allow the sheep to recover without drastically reducing my own hunting intensity. A gradual increase in theta will help maintain balance and support the long-term survival of both species.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting to sustain the wolf population. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance and avoids depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we manage our numbers more sustainably. This cautious approach aligns with the need to ensure long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta allows for reduced hunting intensity, giving sheep a chance to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably.
