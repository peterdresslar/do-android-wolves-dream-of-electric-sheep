            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution in hunting. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help us maintain our population while allowing the sheep to recover without depleting their numbers too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, reducing hunting intensity to give sheep a chance to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A moderate hunting intensity will allow sheep to recover while preventing overexploitation, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This gradual adjustment will help maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure on the sheep, allowing their numbers to recover while we manage our own population dynamics.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is quite low at 28.95, which is only 2.9% of its maximum capacity. Given the high wolf population of 51, there is a risk of overhunting leading to a crash in the sheep population. A lower theta allows for more competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while reducing pressure on their dwindling numbers. This cautious approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence and avoids overhunting, which could lead to a crash in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we manage our numbers more sustainably. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves, ensuring our long-term survival and preventing a crash in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach helps maintain a balance without risking a drastic decline in sheep numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while being cautious about the wolf population growth. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent further depletion of sheep."
