            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. A moderate hunting intensity will help maintain a balance between the wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term survival for both.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still providing enough sustenance for the wolves. This approach helps maintain a balance and prevents overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain its health. This approach aligns with the need for a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This cautious approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",

A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This cautious approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is relatively high, indicating increased competition. A moderate approach will allow the sheep to recover while preventing overexploitation. This balance is crucial for the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating that competition among wolves is increasing. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while managing the wolf population sustainably.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on stabilizing our own numbers. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
