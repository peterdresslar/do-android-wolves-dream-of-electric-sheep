This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 3.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their collapse. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition with other wolves. This cautious approach aligns with the need for long-term sustainability.",

By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while ensuring the sheep have a chance to stabilize and grow. This aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and the need for sustainable coexistence.",

To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. A gradual decrease in theta will help maintain a balance while avoiding sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",

By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also considering the potential for gradual wolf population growth. This approach aligns with the wisdom of sustainable coexistence and avoids sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still concerningly low, indicating a need for caution in hunting. However, with a relatively low wolf population and a high sheep-to-wolf ratio, a moderate increase in hunting intensity will allow for some growth in the wolf population while still giving sheep a chance to recover. This balance supports long-term sustainability.",

To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting but prioritizes the sustainability of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low at only 10% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep population. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can allow the sheep to stabilize and gradually increase their numbers, which will ultimately benefit the wolf population in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low at only 11% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. With the wolf population being moderately high, it is prudent to focus on competition among wolves rather than intense hunting of sheep at this time. This will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
