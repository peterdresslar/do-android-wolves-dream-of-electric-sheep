A moderate theta allows for a cautious approach, enabling the sheep to recover while still maintaining some hunting to support wolf reproduction. This balance is essential for the long-term survival of both species.",

A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling wolves to maintain their numbers. This approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence and avoids drastic changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we manage our numbers more sustainably. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a balance and avoiding sudden changes.",

A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This gradual adjustment will help create a more sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 3.9% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while reducing pressure on the wolf population, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we manage our numbers more sustainably. This gradual adjustment helps avoid overhunting and supports long-term balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is quite low at 28.95, which is only 2.9% of its maximum capacity. Given the high wolf population of 51, increasing competition among wolves is likely. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover while managing the wolf population sustainably.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is quite low, and with a high wolf population, competition is increasing. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach helps maintain balance and prevents overexploitation of the sheep."
