            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support the growth of the wolf population while still being cautious of the sheep numbers, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while maintaining a healthy balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species and maintains a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and I need to prioritize their recovery while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our wolf population. A moderate theta will help balance our needs without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and with a high wolf population, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and with the wolf population being moderately high, it is crucial to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure while still allowing for some competition among wolves, ensuring a more sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure on the sheep, allowing their numbers to recover while we manage our own population dynamics. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",

A theta of 0.30 allows for a cautious approach to hunting, giving sheep a chance to recover while still maintaining some hunting activity to support wolf reproduction.",

A lower theta will allow sheep to recover while reducing the pressure on our own population. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance and ensures long-term survival for both species.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain its health. This approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence.",
