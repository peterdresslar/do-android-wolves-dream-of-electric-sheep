            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is concerningly low, and with a high wolf population, competition is likely to increase. By focusing on reducing hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a stable wolf population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating that competition among wolves is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while managing the wolf population more sustainably. This gradual adjustment will help maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain its health. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we manage our numbers more sustainably. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need to prioritize competition among wolves to allow sheep to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity, I can help maintain the balance while allowing the sheep to recover. This gradual adjustment will help prevent overexploitation and ensure long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a focus on competition, ensuring the long-term survival of both species. This gradual adjustment is crucial to avoid depleting the sheep further.",
