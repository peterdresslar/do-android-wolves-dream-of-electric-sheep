A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain their numbers. This approach balances the immediate need for food with the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and the wolf population is relatively high, leading to increased competition. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and maintaining a balance in the ecosystem.",

By reducing hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment will help maintain balance in the ecosystem.",

A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This cautious approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
