            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 245\n- Sheep population: 29.99\n- Wolf population: 29.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.250\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 1.03 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 3.0% of maximum capacity\n\nEcosystem observations:\n- The wolf population is moderately high.\n- Sheep numbers are becoming concerning, suggesting caution may be needed.\n- The ratio of sheep to wolves is becoming less favorable, which may require adaptation.\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and with the wolf population being high, a balanced approach is necessary to prevent overhunting while allowing sheep numbers to recover. A moderate theta will help maintain coexistence and avoid drastic fluctuations in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is concerningly low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A moderate hunting intensity will allow sheep to recover while still enabling wolves to sustain themselves without depleting the sheep population further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A moderate hunting intensity will allow sheep to recover while preventing overpopulation of wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep population to recover while ensuring that our own numbers stabilize. This approach helps maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity, allowing the sheep to recover while we manage our own numbers more sustainably.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow sheep to recover while we focus on stabilizing our own numbers. This gradual approach helps maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity, I can help sustain my pack while allowing the sheep population to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a balance and responding to current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 3.9% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, indicating that we need to prioritize the recovery of sheep while still allowing for some hunting. A gradual increase from my previous theta will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity, allowing the sheep to recover while we manage our numbers more sustainably.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help sustain our population while allowing the sheep to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover.
