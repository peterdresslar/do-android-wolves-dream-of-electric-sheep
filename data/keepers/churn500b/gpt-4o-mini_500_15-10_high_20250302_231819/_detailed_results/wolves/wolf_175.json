A moderate hunting intensity will allow for some sheep recovery while still enabling wolves to thrive. This balance is crucial for long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still providing enough resources for the wolf pack to sustain itself. This approach helps maintain a balance in the ecosystem without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A moderate theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting, giving sheep a chance to recover while still enabling wolves to sustain themselves. This balance is crucial to avoid over-depleting the sheep and risking a crash in both populations.",

By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. This approach supports long-term sustainability and prevents potential crashes in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 2.9% of its maximum capacity, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. With a high wolf population, competition is likely to increase, and a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while preventing overexploitation. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",

A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",

By slightly increasing my hunting intensity, I can help maintain the sheep population while still allowing for some competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment will help ensure a sustainable balance.",
