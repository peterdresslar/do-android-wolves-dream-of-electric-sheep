            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is concerningly low, and with a high wolf population, competition is likely to increase. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while giving the sheep a chance to recover, ensuring a sustainable balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and with the wolf population being relatively high, it is prudent to focus on reducing competition among wolves while allowing the sheep to recover. A moderate approach will help maintain balance and prevent a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our own numbers. This cautious approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need to focus on competition among wolves rather than intense hunting. This will allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a sustainable wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting, ensuring a balance that supports both populations in the long term.",

A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure on the sheep, allowing their numbers to recover while we adapt to the current conditions. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
