With the wolf population being moderately high, it's important to focus on competition among wolves rather than intensifying hunting, allowing the sheep to recover while maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This cautious approach ensures the long-term survival of both species and prevents overhunting."
