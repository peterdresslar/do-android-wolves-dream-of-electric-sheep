A moderate theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while also giving sheep a chance to recover. This balance helps avoid over-depletion of sheep and maintains a sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain stability. This approach balances the immediate need for food with the long-term sustainability of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A lower theta allows for a focus on reducing competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment will help maintain balance and ensure the long-term survival of both species.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. Reducing hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance in the ecosystem.",

A lower theta allows for more focus on reducing competition among wolves while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 3.0% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
