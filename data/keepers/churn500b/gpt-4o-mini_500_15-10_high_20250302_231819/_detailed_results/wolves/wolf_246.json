            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and a cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while ensuring the sheep have a chance to rebound, which is vital for the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and the wolf population is moderately high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while still competing with other wolves. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure on the sheep, allowing their numbers to recover while still maintaining a focus on competition among wolves. This approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is relatively high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure on the sheep, allowing their numbers to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This gradual adjustment aligns with the need for balance in the ecosystem.",

A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This gradual adjustment helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we manage our numbers more sustainably. This cautious approach aligns with the need to avoid depleting the sheep further and ensures long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is relatively high, indicating increased competition. A lower theta allows for a focus on reducing competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover. This approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence and avoids depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A lower theta will allow sheep to recover while preventing overhunting, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting, ensuring a balance that supports both species in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need to focus on reducing competition among wolves while allowing the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help maintain balance and prevent overhunting, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 3.9% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to prioritize reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while managing competition among wolves."
