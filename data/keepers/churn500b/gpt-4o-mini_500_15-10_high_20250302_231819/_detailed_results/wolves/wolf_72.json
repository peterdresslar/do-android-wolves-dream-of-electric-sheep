            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that a more cautious approach is necessary. By slightly increasing my focus on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep population to recover while still maintaining a sustainable wolf population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of avoiding sudden changes and responding to the current ecosystem state.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both species by preventing overhunting and promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and with a high sheep-to-wolf ratio, it is crucial to prioritize the recovery of the sheep. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves to ensure a balanced ecosystem.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. By reducing hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while managing competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This gradual adjustment helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and with a high wolf population, competition is likely increasing. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our pack",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain their numbers. This approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence and avoids drastic changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need to reduce hunting intensity to allow sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. A gradual decrease in theta will help maintain balance and prevent overexploitation of the sheep.",
