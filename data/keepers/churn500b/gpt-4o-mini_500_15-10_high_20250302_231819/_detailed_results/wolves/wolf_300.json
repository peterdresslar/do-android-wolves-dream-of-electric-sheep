A moderate increase in theta allows for a balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep, promoting sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while also maintaining a healthy wolf population. This approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence and avoids depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity, allowing the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",

A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while reducing pressure on the wolf population. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance and ensures long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is quite low at only 2.9% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain balance and prevent overhunting.",
