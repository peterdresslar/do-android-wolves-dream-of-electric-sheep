A lower theta allows for more focus on reducing competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment will help maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low relative to the wolf population, indicating a need for caution in hunting to allow sheep numbers to recover. A moderate approach will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the survival of both species.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure on the sheep, allowing their numbers to recover while we manage our own population dynamics more sustainably.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach helps maintain balance and avoids over-depletion of resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep while allowing the wolf population to stabilize. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure and give the sheep a chance to rebound.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted to support wolf reproduction, but I must remain cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. This gradual adjustment allows for a more sustainable balance.",
