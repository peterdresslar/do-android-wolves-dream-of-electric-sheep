            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while I need to maintain a healthy wolf population, I must prioritize the sustainability of the ecosystem. A moderate hunting intensity allows for some sheep recovery while still enabling wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is concerningly low, and with a high wolf population, competition is likely to increase. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, enabling sheep recovery while still maintaining enough hunting to support our wolf pack",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is concerningly low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A moderate decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling wolves to maintain their population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we manage our numbers more sustainably. This cautious approach aligns with the need to balance both populations for long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition among wolves. A lower theta allows for a focus on reducing competition and giving the sheep a chance to recover. This approach aligns with my objective of ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",

By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both species.",

            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta value will allow the sheep to recover while reducing pressure on the wolf population. This gradual adjustment is necessary to ensure long-term sustainability for both species.",
