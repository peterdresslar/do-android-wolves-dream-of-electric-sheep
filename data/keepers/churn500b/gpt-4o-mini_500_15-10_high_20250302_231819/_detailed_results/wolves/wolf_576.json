A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while also helping to stabilize the wolf population. This gradual adjustment is crucial for maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is quite low at 36.95, which is only 3.7% of its maximum capacity. With a high wolf population of 61, the competition among wolves is increasing, and it is crucial to allow the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure, giving the sheep a chance to rebound while maintaining some focus on competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta allows for more focus on reducing competition and giving the sheep a chance to recover, while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population. This gradual adjustment helps avoid drastic impacts on the sheep and promotes long-term sustainability.",

This cautious approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution in hunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population and reducing competition among wolves.",

By reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing the competition among wolves. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable.
