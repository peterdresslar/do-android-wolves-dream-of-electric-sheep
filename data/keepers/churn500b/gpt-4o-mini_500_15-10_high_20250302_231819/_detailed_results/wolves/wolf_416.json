            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta allows the sheep to recover while reducing pressure on the wolf population, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating that competition among wolves is increasing. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach aims to maintain a sustainable balance without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain their numbers. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need to reduce hunting intensity to allow sheep to recover. This will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem and prevent overexploitation of the sheep.",

A theta of 0.30 allows for a cautious approach, focusing on reducing hunting intensity to give sheep a chance to recover while still maintaining some hunting to support wolf reproduction. This balance is crucial for long-term sustainability.",
