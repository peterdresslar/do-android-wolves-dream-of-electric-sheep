            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and a cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the ecosystem and ensure that both wolves and sheep can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and with a wolf population that is moderately high, it is prudent to focus on competition among wolves rather than intensifying hunting. This will allow the sheep to recover while maintaining our own numbers. A gradual increase from my previous theta will help ensure a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta allows for a focus on reducing competition and giving the sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our own numbers. This gradual adjustment will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain their numbers. This approach supports long-term sustainability and avoids drastic changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while reducing pressure on the wolf population, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain itself. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity, allowing the sheep to recover while we manage our numbers more sustainably.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need to reduce hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help balance the ecosystem and prevent overexploitation of the sheep, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the need for balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity, allowing the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. This approach aims for a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating that competition among wolves is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This gradual adjustment will help maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
