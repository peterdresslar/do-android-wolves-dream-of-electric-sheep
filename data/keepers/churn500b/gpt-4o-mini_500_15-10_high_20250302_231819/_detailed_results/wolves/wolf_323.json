            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 286\n- Sheep population: 39.34\n- Wolf population: 74.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.300\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.53 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 3.9% of maximum capacity\n\nEcosystem observations:\n- The wolf population is quite high, which may lead to increased competition.\n- Sheep numbers are becoming concerning, suggesting caution may be needed.\n- The ratio of sheep to wolves is becoming less favorable, which may require adaptation.\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and ensures the long-term survival of both our pack and the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and the current wolf population is moderately high. A slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted to support reproduction, but I must be cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. This adjustment allows for a gradual response to the ecosystem",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while the wolf population is moderately high, it is crucial to allow the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help maintain balance and prevent overhunting, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",

A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta allows for more focus on reducing competition among wolves, which can help stabilize the wolf population and give sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment is crucial for maintaining balance in the ecosystem.",
