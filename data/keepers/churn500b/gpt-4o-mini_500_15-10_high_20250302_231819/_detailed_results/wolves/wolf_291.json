A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, enabling sheep to recover while still allowing wolves to maintain their numbers. This adjustment helps avoid over-exploitation of the sheep and promotes long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some reproduction among wolves. This approach helps maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta allows for a focus on reducing competition while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This approach aims to create a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. By focusing on reducing hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This cautious approach aligns with the need for long-term balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we manage our numbers more sustainably. This cautious approach aligns with the need for long-term survival and balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 3.0% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while reducing pressure on their dwindling numbers. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution in hunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population, ensuring long-term balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. By reducing hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while managing competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance without risking a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. With the wolf population moderately high, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance in the ecosystem without risking a crash."
