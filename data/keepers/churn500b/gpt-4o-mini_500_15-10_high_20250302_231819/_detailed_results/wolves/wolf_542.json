A moderate hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, allowing for sustainable coexistence while still supporting my pack",

This approach supports sustainable coexistence and avoids depleting the sheep further.",

A moderate approach will help maintain balance and prevent overexploitation of the sheep, while still allowing for some hunting to support wolf reproduction.",

To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while managing the wolf population sustainably.",

This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
