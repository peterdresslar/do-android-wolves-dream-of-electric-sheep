            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 342\n- Sheep population: 38.75\n- Wolf population: 39.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.250\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.99 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 3.9% of maximum capacity\n\nEcosystem observations:\n- The wolf population is quite high, which may lead to increased competition.\n- Sheep numbers are becoming concerning, suggesting caution may be needed.\n- The ratio of sheep to wolves is becoming less favorable, which may require adaptation.\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low at 11.9% of maximum capacity, indicating that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow the sheep to recover. With the wolf population being moderately high, it is prudent to focus on competition among wolves rather than intense hunting, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is concerningly low, and the wolf population is relatively high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will allow sheep to recover while reducing the pressure on our own population. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
