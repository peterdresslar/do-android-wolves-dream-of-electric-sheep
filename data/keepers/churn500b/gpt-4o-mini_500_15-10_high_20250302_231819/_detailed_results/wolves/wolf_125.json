            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and a cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting will help maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating a need for caution in hunting. By maintaining a moderate hunting intensity, I can help ensure the sheep have a chance to recover while still allowing for some wolf population maintenance. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and promotes a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and I need to prioritize their recovery while still considering the competition among wolves. A lower theta allows for a focus on maintaining the balance and ensuring that sheep can regain their numbers, which is crucial for the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and with the current wolf population being moderately high, it is crucial to focus on competition among wolves rather than intensifying hunting. This will allow the sheep to recover while ensuring that our pack remains strong and sustainable in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and with a high sheep-to-wolf ratio, it is crucial to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity and promote a more sustainable balance in the ecosystem, ensuring both wolves and sheep can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta allows for a focus on reducing competition and giving the sheep a chance to recover, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This gradual adjustment helps ensure a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
