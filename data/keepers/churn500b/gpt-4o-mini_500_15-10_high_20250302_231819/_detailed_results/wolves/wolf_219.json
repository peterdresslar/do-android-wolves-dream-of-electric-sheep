This approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence and avoids depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This cautious approach aligns with the need to maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A lower theta will allow sheep to recover while we manage our numbers more sustainably. This cautious approach will help maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta allows for a focus on reducing competition and giving the sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This gradual adjustment helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while preventing overhunting, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure on the sheep, allowing their numbers to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we manage our numbers more sustainably. This cautious approach aligns with the need to maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach helps maintain balance and avoids overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. It is crucial to prioritize the recovery of the sheep population while allowing the wolf population to stabilize. A lower theta will help ensure that we do not deplete the sheep further and can maintain a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance in the ecosystem."
