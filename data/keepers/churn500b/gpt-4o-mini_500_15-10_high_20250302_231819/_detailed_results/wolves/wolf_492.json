A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent further depletion of sheep, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",

A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This gradual adjustment helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain their numbers. This approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence and avoids depleting the sheep further.",

A lower theta will allow sheep to recover while we manage our numbers more sustainably. This cautious approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",

To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a potential crash.",

A gradual reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This small adjustment helps maintain balance without risking a crash.",
