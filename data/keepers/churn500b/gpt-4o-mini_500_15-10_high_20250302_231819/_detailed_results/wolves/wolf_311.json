            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while preventing overhunting, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is relatively high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta allows for a focus on reducing competition and giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a sustainable wolf population. This gradual adjustment helps ensure long-term survival for both species.",

A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This cautious approach aligns with the need for long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution in hunting. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help the sheep recover while also managing competition among wolves. This balance is crucial for the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is quite low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while reducing the pressure on our own population. This cautious approach aligns with the need for long-term sustainability.",
