            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while managing competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure on the sheep, allowing their numbers to recover while we manage our own population dynamics more sustainably.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This cautious approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating that competition among wolves is increasing. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support reproduction, but it remains cautious to avoid further depleting the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while preventing overhunting, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",

            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This gradual adjustment will help maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta allows for a focus on reducing competition and giving the sheep a chance to recover, while still allowing for some hunting to sustain the wolf population. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance in the ecosystem.",

A lower theta allows for a focus on reducing competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover. This approach aligns with the need for long-term sustainability and avoids depleting the sheep further.",
