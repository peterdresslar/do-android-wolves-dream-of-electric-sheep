            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and the wolf population is relatively high, indicating increased competition. A moderate approach allows for sustainable coexistence while giving sheep a chance to recover. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta allows for a focus on reducing competition and giving the sheep population a chance to recover, while still maintaining some hunting to support wolf reproduction. This gradual adjustment aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This cautious approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating that competition among wolves is increasing. A lower theta will allow sheep to recover while we manage our numbers more sustainably. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance in the ecosystem.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
