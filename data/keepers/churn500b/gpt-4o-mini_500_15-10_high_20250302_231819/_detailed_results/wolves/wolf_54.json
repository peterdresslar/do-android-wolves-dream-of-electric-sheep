            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help stabilize the ecosystem and ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and a cautious approach is necessary to allow for recovery. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep while still allowing for some competition among wolves.",

A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to replenish their numbers while still keeping an eye on the competition among wolves. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in our ecosystem.",

A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain itself. This approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence and avoids drastic changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
