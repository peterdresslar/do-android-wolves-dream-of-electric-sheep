By setting theta at 0.5, I can maintain hunting intensity to support reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover, avoiding overexploitation and ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to sustain themselves. This approach helps maintain a balance in the ecosystem without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow sheep to recover while still addressing competition among wolves.
