By maintaining a moderate hunting intensity, I can ensure the survival of both wolves and sheep while adapting to the current ecosystem state.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution in hunting to allow sheep to recover while still maintaining a sustainable wolf population. A moderate theta will help balance our needs without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A lower theta will allow sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This gradual adjustment helps ensure long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is relatively high, leading to increased competition. By focusing on lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a balance within the wolf pack. This cautious approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while reducing competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This cautious approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we manage our numbers more sustainably. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and with a high wolf population, competition is increasing. A lower theta will allow sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments to ensure long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta allows for a focus on reducing competition and giving sheep a chance to recover, while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our reproductive needs. This gradual adjustment helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. By focusing on reducing hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and maintaining a balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance and avoids overexploitation."
