A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain their numbers. This balance is crucial for the long-term survival of both species.",

This approach aligns with the need for a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",

By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments to maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This cautious approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence.",

To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain balance and prevent overhunting.",
