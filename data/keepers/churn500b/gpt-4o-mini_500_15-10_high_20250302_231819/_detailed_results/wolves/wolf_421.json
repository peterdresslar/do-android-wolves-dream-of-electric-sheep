A lower theta allows for more focus on competing with other wolves, which can help stabilize the wolf population while giving sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment is necessary to avoid depleting the sheep further and to ensure long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still providing some sustenance for the wolves, ensuring a balance that supports both populations in the long term.",

            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A lower theta will allow sheep to recover while reducing pressure on the wolf population. This cautious approach aligns with the goal of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",

A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach helps maintain balance and avoids overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is quite low at 4.4% of maximum capacity, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.82 indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. With a high wolf population, focusing on competition rather than aggressive hunting will help maintain balance and ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
