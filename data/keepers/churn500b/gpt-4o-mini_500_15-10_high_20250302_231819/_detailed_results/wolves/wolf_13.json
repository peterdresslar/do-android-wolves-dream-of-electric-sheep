            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, indicating that a moderate increase in hunting intensity is necessary to prevent overpopulation and ensure sustainability. However, given the current low wolf population, I will avoid drastic changes and maintain a balanced approach to allow for gradual adaptation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the wolf population, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still being cautious about the sheep numbers, ensuring we do not deplete their population too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating a need for caution in hunting. While there are many sheep per wolf, a moderate approach allows for sustainable coexistence and gives the sheep a chance to recover without drastically reducing their numbers. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to recover. This approach prioritizes the long-term survival of both species and helps maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution. With the wolf population being moderately high, it is wise to focus on competition among wolves rather than intensifying hunting. This will allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This gradual adjustment helps ensure a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain itself. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution.
