            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight increase in hunting intensity is necessary to support wolf reproduction, but I must remain cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. This gradual adjustment allows for a more sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species and maintains a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while avoiding further depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low and concerning, indicating a need for caution in hunting. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while still competing with other wolves. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and it is crucial to prioritize their recovery while allowing for some competition among wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the sheep population and ensure that we do not deplete their numbers further, which could jeopardize our long-term survival.",

A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure on the sheep, allowing their numbers to recover while also managing the competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment will promote a more sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
