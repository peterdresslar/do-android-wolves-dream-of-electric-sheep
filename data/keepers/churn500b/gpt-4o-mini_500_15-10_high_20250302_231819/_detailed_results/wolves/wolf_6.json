A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting while still enabling the sheep population to recover.",

While my previous theta was low, a slight increase to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach to hunting while still prioritizing the long-term health of both the sheep and wolf populations. This adjustment reflects the need to respond to the current state of the ecosystem without making drastic changes.",
