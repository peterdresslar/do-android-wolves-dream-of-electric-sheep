            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and the wolf population is moderately high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while still competing with other wolves. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. By reducing hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while also preventing overpopulation of wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we manage our numbers more sustainably. This cautious approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
