            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution in hunting. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, enabling the sheep to recover while still allowing for some hunting to sustain the wolf population. This adjustment helps maintain a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling us to sustain our own numbers. This approach balances the immediate need for food with the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. This moderate approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our own numbers. This cautious approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence and avoids depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need to focus on reducing competition among wolves while allowing the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. By reducing hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while managing competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment will help maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is quite low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta allows for a focus on reducing competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment is essential for maintaining balance and ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure on sheep, allowing their numbers to recover while we focus on maintaining our own population stability.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from my previous theta, I can help maintain the sheep population while still allowing for some hunting to support wolf reproduction. This gradual adjustment will help avoid over-depleting the sheep and allow for a more sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 2.8% of its maximum capacity, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. A gradual decrease in theta will help maintain balance and prevent a crash in the ecosystem."
