            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate approach will help maintain balance and prevent overexploitation of the sheep while still allowing for some hunting to support the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain their numbers. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments to ensure long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a balance in the wolf population. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and prioritizes long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This cautious approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and with the wolf population being high, it is essential to reduce hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash in sheep numbers, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta allows for a focus on reducing competition and giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability.",

A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on reducing our own numbers gradually. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is moderately high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity slightly to allow the sheep to recover while still competing with other wolves. This gradual adjustment helps maintain a balance in the ecosystem.",

To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. This cautious approach will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance without risking the depletion of our prey.",

To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. A gradual decrease in theta will help maintain balance and prevent further depletion of the sheep.",
