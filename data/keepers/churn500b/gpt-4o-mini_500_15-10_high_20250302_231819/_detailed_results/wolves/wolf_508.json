            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta allows for reduced hunting pressure on the sheep, giving them a chance to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This cautious approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure on the sheep, allowing their numbers to recover while still enabling some hunting to maintain our population. This gradual adjustment is crucial for long-term balance.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep. By reducing hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species and allow the sheep population to stabilize.",
