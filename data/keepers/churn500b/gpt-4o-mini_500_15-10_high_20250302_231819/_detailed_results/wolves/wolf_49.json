A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach that can help stabilize both populations.",

A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a sustainable wolf population. This gradual adjustment helps avoid over-depletion of the sheep and supports long-term coexistence.",
