            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 141\n- Sheep population: 29.29\n- Wolf population: 54.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.300\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.54 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 2.9% of maximum capacity\n\nEcosystem observations:\n- The wolf population is quite high, which may lead to increased competition.\n- Sheep numbers are becoming concerning, suggesting caution may be needed.\n- The ratio of sheep to wolves is becoming less favorable, which may require adaptation.\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating that we need to be cautious with our hunting to allow the sheep to recover while still ensuring our own survival. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help balance the needs of both populations without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and the wolf population is relatively high, indicating increased competition. A moderate hunting intensity will allow for some sheep recovery while still supporting our wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and the wolf population is relatively high, indicating increased competition. A moderate hunting intensity will allow for some sheep recovery while still enabling wolves to thrive. This approach aims to maintain a sustainable balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta allows for a focus on reducing competition and giving the sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is relatively high, leading to increased competition. By focusing on competition rather than intense hunting, I can allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a sustainable wolf population. This gradual adjustment will help ensure long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This gradual adjustment helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta allows the sheep to recover while we focus on reducing competition. This approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence and avoids depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity, I can help sustain the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while reducing pressure on the wolf population. This gradual adjustment will help maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating that competition among wolves is increasing. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach helps maintain a balance and avoids depleting the sheep further.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 2.9% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while reducing the pressure on the wolf population, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species."
