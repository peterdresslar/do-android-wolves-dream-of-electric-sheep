            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 385\n- Sheep population: 43.53\n- Wolf population: 48.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.300\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.91 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 4.4% of maximum capacity\n\nEcosystem observations:\n- The wolf population is quite high, which may lead to increased competition.\n- Sheep numbers are becoming concerning, suggesting caution may be needed.\n- The ratio of sheep to wolves is becoming less favorable, which may require adaptation.\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that a more cautious approach is needed to prevent their depletion. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while also giving the sheep a chance to recover, ensuring a sustainable balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution. With the wolf population moderately high, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and with the wolf population being moderately high, it",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is concerningly low, and with a high wolf population, competition is likely increasing. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while also reducing competition among wolves. This approach supports long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A theta of 0.30 allows me to focus more on competing with other wolves, which will help reduce the wolf population slightly and give the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment is crucial for maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating that competition among wolves is increasing. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure on the sheep, allowing their numbers to recover while we manage our own population dynamics more sustainably.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while preventing overhunting, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we manage our numbers more sustainably. This cautious approach aligns with the need to avoid overexploitation of the sheep and ensures long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach helps maintain balance and avoids over-depletion of resources.",
