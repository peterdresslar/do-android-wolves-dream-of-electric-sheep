            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need to focus on competition among wolves rather than hunting sheep. This will allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a balance in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A moderate hunting intensity allows for some sheep recovery while still enabling wolves to thrive. This approach helps maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This gradual adjustment will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A theta of 0.30 allows me to focus on reducing competition while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This balanced approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",

A lower theta allows for a focus on reducing competition and giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This cautious approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure on the sheep, allowing their numbers to recover while also managing competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",

A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This gradual adjustment helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating that increased competition among wolves is likely. A lower theta allows the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting to maintain wolf health. This gradual adjustment helps avoid over-depletion of the sheep and supports long-term balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves.

To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population. A gradual decrease in theta will help maintain balance without sudden disruptions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
