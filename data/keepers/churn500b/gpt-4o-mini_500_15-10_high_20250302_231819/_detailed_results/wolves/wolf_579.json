A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. A moderate hunting intensity will allow sheep to recover while preventing overcompetition among wolves. This approach aligns with the goal of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This gradual adjustment will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help reduce competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to stabilize, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 3.3% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while reducing pressure on their dwindling numbers. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while managing competition among wolves. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both species.",

A gradual decrease in theta will help maintain a balance while avoiding sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
