This approach balances the immediate need for food with the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta allows for a focus on reducing competition, giving sheep a chance to recover while maintaining a sustainable wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow sheep to recover while preventing overhunting, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta allows for more focus on reducing competition and giving sheep a chance to recover, while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population. This gradual adjustment helps ensure long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while managing competition among wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep further and to ensure long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and with a high wolf population, competition is increasing. Lowering my hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This cautious approach aligns with the need for balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution in hunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population and reducing competition among wolves."
