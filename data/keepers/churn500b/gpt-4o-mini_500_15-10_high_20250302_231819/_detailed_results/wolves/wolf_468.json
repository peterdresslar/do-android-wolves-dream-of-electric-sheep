            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. By reducing hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while managing competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This gradual adjustment helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure on the sheep, allowing their numbers to recover while we manage our own population dynamics more sustainably.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This gradual adjustment helps ensure long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover while also being cautious about the moderately high wolf population.",

To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. This cautious approach will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance without risking a crash.",

To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. This cautious approach will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating that a cautious approach is necessary to allow for recovery. While I need to maintain a healthy wolf population, I must prioritize the sustainability of the ecosystem by not overhunting the sheep. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further.
