            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while still competing with other wolves. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, which suggests a cautious approach is necessary to allow for recovery. However, with a high sheep-to-wolf ratio, there is room for moderate hunting to support wolf reproduction. A gradual increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that considers both immediate needs and long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while there are many sheep per wolf, a cautious increase in hunting intensity is warranted to ensure the sheep can recover. This moderate adjustment allows for sustainable coexistence while still addressing the needs of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species and avoids depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity, allowing the sheep population to recover while also managing the competition among wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we manage our numbers more sustainably. This cautious approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
