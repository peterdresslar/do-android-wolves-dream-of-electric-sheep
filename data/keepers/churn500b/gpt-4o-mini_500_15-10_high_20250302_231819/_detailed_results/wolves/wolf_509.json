            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 438\n- Sheep population: 39.48\n- Wolf population: 27.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.250\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 1.46 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 3.9% of maximum capacity\n\nEcosystem observations:\n- The wolf population is moderately high.\n- Sheep numbers are becoming concerning, suggesting caution may be needed.\n- The ratio of sheep to wolves is becoming less favorable, which may require adaptation.\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is concerningly low, and with a high wolf population, competition is likely to increase. A lower theta allows for a focus on reducing competition among wolves while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and with a high wolf population, competition is likely increasing. By lowering the hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a sustainable balance within the wolf pack. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments to ensure long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we manage our own numbers. This approach promotes long-term sustainability and prevents a crash in both populations.",

By slightly increasing my hunting intensity, I can help sustain my pack while allowing sheep to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a balance in the ecosystem.",
