            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is relatively high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This cautious approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. By reducing hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while managing competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta allows for more focus on competition among wolves, which can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment is essential for maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need to focus on reducing competition among wolves while allowing the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both species by preventing overhunting and promoting a more sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need to prioritize competition among wolves to allow the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population and reducing competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. A gradual adjustment to 0.30 reflects a cautious approach that balances the immediate need for food with the long-term health of the ecosystem.",
