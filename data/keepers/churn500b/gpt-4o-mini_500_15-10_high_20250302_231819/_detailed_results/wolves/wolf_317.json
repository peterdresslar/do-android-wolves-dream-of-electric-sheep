A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This cautious approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain their numbers. This approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence and avoids drastic changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. By reducing hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
