            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and with the wolf population being high, it is crucial to adopt a more balanced approach. A moderate theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability.",

A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure on the sheep, allowing their numbers to recover while we manage our own population sustainably. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
