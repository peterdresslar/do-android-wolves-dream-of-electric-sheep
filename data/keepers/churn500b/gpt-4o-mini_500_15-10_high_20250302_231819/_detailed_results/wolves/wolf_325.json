            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is concerningly low, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a potential crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This cautious approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta allows for more focus on reducing competition and giving sheep a chance to recover, which is essential for long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This gradual approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. By reducing hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while managing competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",

A lower theta allows for a focus on reducing competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment will help maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. By reducing hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population more sustainably. This cautious approach aligns with the need for long-term balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from the previous theta, I can still focus on competition among wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance."
