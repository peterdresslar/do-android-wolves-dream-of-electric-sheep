By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also ensuring that the wolf population does not decline too rapidly. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both species.",

A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This cautious approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a sustainable wolf population. This gradual adjustment helps avoid overhunting and supports long-term balance in the ecosystem.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting to maintain our population. This gradual adjustment is crucial for long-term sustainability.",

A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach helps maintain balance and avoids overexploitation.",

A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity, allowing the sheep to recover while also stabilizing the wolf population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence.",
