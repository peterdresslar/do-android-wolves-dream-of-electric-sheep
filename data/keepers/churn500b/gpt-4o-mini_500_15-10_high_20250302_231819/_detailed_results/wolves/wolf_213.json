A lower theta allows for a focus on reducing competition among wolves while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",

A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while also helping to stabilize the wolf population. This cautious approach aligns with the need for long-term sustainability and avoids overhunting.",

A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach helps maintain balance and avoids overexploitation.",
