A moderate increase in hunting intensity allows for some recovery of the sheep population while still supporting the wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution in hunting to allow sheep to recover while still maintaining a sustainable level of hunting to support wolf reproduction. A moderate theta will help balance the competition among wolves and the need for sheep.",

A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain their numbers. This approach supports sustainable coexistence without depleting the sheep further.",

This approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence and avoids depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A lower theta allows for more focus on reducing competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment is essential for maintaining balance in the ecosystem.",
