A lower theta will allow for competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to replenish, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and with a high sheep-to-wolf ratio, it is crucial to prioritize the recovery of the sheep. A lower theta will allow for competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to rebound, ensuring long-term sustainability for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A theta of 0.30 allows me to focus on reducing competition while giving the sheep a chance to recover, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. By reducing hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while managing competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. This approach supports long-term sustainability and avoids depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity, allowing sheep to recover while managing the wolf population sustainably. This cautious approach aligns with the need for balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need to prioritize the recovery of sheep while managing competition among wolves. A lower theta will help ensure the sheep can rebound, allowing for a more sustainable ecosystem in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is quite low at only 5% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution in hunting. With the wolf population being relatively high, increasing competition among wolves could lead to instability. A gradual adjustment to 0.25 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. By reducing hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while managing competition among wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while managing competition among wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for sustainable coexistence."
