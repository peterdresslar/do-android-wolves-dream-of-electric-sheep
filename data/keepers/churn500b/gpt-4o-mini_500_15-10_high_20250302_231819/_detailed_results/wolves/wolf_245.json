            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A gradual increase in hunting intensity is necessary to ensure the wolf population can thrive, but I must remain cautious to allow the sheep to recover. This small adjustment helps maintain balance without risking a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This cautious approach is essential for ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach helps maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating that a cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to stabilize, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low at only 5.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash in sheep numbers, which would ultimately harm the wolf population as well.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low at only 6.1% of maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent further depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and a more cautious approach is needed to allow their numbers to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.20 to 0.25, I can still maintain some hunting activity while prioritizing the long-term survival of both sheep and wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating that a cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while ensuring the sheep have a chance to rebound, which is crucial for the long-term survival of both species.",

A lower theta allows for more focus on competing with other wolves, which can help stabilize the wolf population while giving sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep further and to ensure long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition, while the sheep population is low and concerning. A moderate hunting intensity will allow for some recovery of the sheep while still enabling the wolves to maintain their population.
