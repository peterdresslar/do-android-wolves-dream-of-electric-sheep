            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 386\n- Sheep population: 42.02\n- Wolf population: 44.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.300\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.95 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 4.2% of maximum capacity\n\nEcosystem observations:\n- The wolf population is quite high, which may lead to increased competition.\n- Sheep numbers are becoming concerning, suggesting caution may be needed.\n- The ratio of sheep to wolves is becoming less favorable, which may require adaptation.\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while I want to ensure the survival of both wolves and sheep, I must prioritize caution in my hunting strategy. A moderate theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while giving sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both sheep and wolves while still competing with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and with a high wolf population, it is crucial to focus on competition among wolves rather than intensifying hunting. This will allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a balance in our own numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow sheep to recover while preventing overhunting, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta allows for a focus on reducing competition and giving the sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating that increased competition among wolves could lead to a decline in our numbers. By lowering the hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing the competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling wolves to sustain themselves. This approach aligns with the need for balance and avoids drastic changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",

By reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This gradual adjustment is essential for long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is quite low at 4.8% of its maximum capacity, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover while managing the high wolf population. Gradually increasing my hunting intensity is essential, but I must do so carefully to avoid depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves.
