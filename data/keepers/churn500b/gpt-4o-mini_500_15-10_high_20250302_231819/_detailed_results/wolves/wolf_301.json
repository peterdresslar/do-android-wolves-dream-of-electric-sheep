A lower theta will allow sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This cautious approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain their numbers. This approach aligns with the need for a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. By reducing hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while managing competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment will help maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating that competition among wolves is increasing. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure on the sheep, allowing their numbers to recover while we manage our own population dynamics. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution in hunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach helps maintain balance and avoids overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 3.0% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure on the sheep, allowing their numbers to recover while we manage our own population dynamics.",

This gradual adjustment aligns with the need for balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is quite low at only 2.9% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on reducing competition among wolves. This approach aligns with the goal of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help sustain the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover gradually. This approach balances our immediate needs with the long-term health of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 3.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their rapid depletion. With the wolf population also moderately high, it is prudent to focus on competition among wolves and allow the sheep to recover.

A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting, enabling some recovery of the sheep population while still considering the needs of the wolf pack.
