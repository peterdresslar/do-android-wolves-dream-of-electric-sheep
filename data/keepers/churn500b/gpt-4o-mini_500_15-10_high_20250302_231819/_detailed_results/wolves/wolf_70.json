            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 93\n- Sheep population: 38.13\n- Wolf population: 55.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.250\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.69 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 3.8% of maximum capacity\n\nEcosystem observations:\n- The wolf population is quite high, which may lead to increased competition.\n- Sheep numbers are becoming concerning, suggesting caution may be needed.\n- The ratio of sheep to wolves is becoming less favorable, which may require adaptation.\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating a need for caution in hunting. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some competition among wolves. This balance is crucial for the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and I need to prioritize their recovery while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta will help balance our needs without risking a crash in the sheep population.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need to reduce hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while managing competition among wolves. A gradual decrease in hunting will help maintain balance and ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition among wolves. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling wolves to maintain their numbers. This approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence and avoids drastic changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This cautious approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while reducing pressure on their population, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from the previous theta, I can help maintain the sheep population while still allowing for some reproduction among wolves. This gradual adjustment will help avoid over-depletion of sheep and promote a more sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need to reduce hunting intensity to allow sheep to recover. A lower theta will help balance the ecosystem and prevent overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta allows for a focus on reducing competition and giving sheep a chance to recover, while still maintaining some hunting to support our needs. This gradual adjustment helps ensure long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure on the sheep, allowing their numbers to recover while we manage our own population dynamics."
