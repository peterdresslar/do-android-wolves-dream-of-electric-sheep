A lower theta allows for reduced hunting intensity, giving sheep a chance to recover while also managing competition among wolves. This approach aligns with the goal of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will allow sheep to recover while we manage our numbers more sustainably. This cautious approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is quite low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta allows for more focus on reducing competition among wolves, giving sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment is essential for maintaining balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. It is crucial to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while maintaining a stable wolf population. A lower theta will help ensure that we do not deplete the sheep further, allowing for a more sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This cautious approach helps maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. A moderate approach will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain stability. This gradual adjustment helps avoid overhunting and supports long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This cautious approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. A gradual decrease in theta will help maintain balance without causing sudden shifts in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A gradual reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain its health. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of balancing our needs with the sustainability of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. It is crucial to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both populations and prevent overhunting."
