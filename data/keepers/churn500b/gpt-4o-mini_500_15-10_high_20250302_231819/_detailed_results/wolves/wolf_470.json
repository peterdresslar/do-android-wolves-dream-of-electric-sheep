A moderate approach allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while giving sheep a chance to recover. This balance is essential for the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain their numbers. This balance is crucial for the long-term survival of both species.",
