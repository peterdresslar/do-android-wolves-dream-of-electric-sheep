            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. It is crucial to focus on competition with other wolves to allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both species by preventing overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance and ensures the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and we need to prioritize their recovery to ensure long-term sustainability. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to replenish while still enabling us to compete with other wolves. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while still competing with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a balance and ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to rebound, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and it is crucial to prioritize their recovery to ensure long-term sustainability. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while allowing the sheep numbers to gradually increase. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that we need to prioritize their recovery while still allowing for some hunting. A moderate theta of 0.30 will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep can rebound, thus supporting the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and with a high wolf population, it is crucial to focus on competition among wolves rather than hunting. This will allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while also helping to stabilize the wolf population. This gradual adjustment will promote long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain itself. This approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence and avoids drastic changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
