This gradual approach helps maintain balance in the ecosystem and avoids depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on reducing competition among wolves. This approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta allows for a focus on reducing competition among wolves while giving the sheep population a chance to recover. This approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence and prevents overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on reducing competition within our pack. This gradual adjustment will help maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need to reduce hunting intensity to allow sheep to recover. This will help ensure long-term sustainability for both species and prevent competition among wolves from becoming too fierce.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach helps maintain balance and prevents over-exploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and with the wolf population being relatively high, it is essential to prioritize competition among wolves to allow the sheep to recover. This lower hunting intensity will help maintain a balance and prevent further depletion of the sheep, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach helps maintain balance and prevents overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This cautious approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is moderately high. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance and avoids over-depletion of the sheep."
