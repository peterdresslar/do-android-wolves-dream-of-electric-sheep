            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 149\n- Sheep population: 28.41\n- Wolf population: 23.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.250\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 1.24 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 2.8% of maximum capacity\n\nEcosystem observations:\n- Sheep numbers are becoming concerning, suggesting caution may be needed.\n- The ratio of sheep to wolves is becoming less favorable, which may require adaptation.\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta allows the sheep to recover while preventing overhunting, ensuring the long-term survival of both species. This gradual adjustment will help maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. Reducing hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while also addressing the competition among wolves. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity, I can help maintain the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a sustainable wolf population. This gradual adjustment will help prevent a crash in both populations.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. This cautious approach will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance without risking a crash.",
