A moderate theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while also giving sheep a chance to recover. This balance is crucial for the long-term survival of both species.",

A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain its health. This balance is crucial for the long-term survival of both species.",
