            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and with a high wolf population, we need to balance our hunting intensity to allow sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. A moderate theta of 0.5 will help maintain a sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still providing enough sustenance for the wolves. This approach helps maintain a balance and avoids depleting the sheep further.",
