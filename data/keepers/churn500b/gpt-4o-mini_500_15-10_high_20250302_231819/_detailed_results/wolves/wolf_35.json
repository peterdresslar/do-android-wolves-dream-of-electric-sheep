            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while my previous theta allowed for some reproduction, it is now crucial to adopt a more balanced approach. A theta of 0.5 will help maintain the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain their numbers. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments to ensure long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta allows for a focus on reducing competition while giving sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is relatively high, indicating increased competition among wolves. By focusing on lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This gradual adjustment helps maintain a balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This gradual adjustment helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution in hunting to allow sheep to recover. A moderate theta will help maintain balance and prevent overexploitation of the sheep while still allowing for some hunting.",
