By reducing hunting intensity slightly, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both sheep and wolves, while still competing with other wolves.",

This approach aligns with the need for long-term sustainability and avoids further depletion of the sheep population.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. With the wolf population moderately high, focusing on competition rather than intense hunting will help maintain balance and ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A theta of 0.30 allows me to focus on reducing competition while still permitting some hunting of sheep to ensure our survival. This gradual adjustment will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while reducing pressure on the wolf population. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain their numbers.

A lower theta will allow sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments to ensure long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach helps maintain a balance and avoids overexploitation.",
