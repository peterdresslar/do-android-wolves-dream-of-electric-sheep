By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while ensuring the sheep have a chance to rebound, promoting long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low at only 9.0% of maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensifying hunting. This will allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a healthy balance in the ecosystem.",

This aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
