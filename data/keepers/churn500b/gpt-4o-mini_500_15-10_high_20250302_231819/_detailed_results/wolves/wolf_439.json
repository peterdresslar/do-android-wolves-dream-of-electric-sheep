            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species and maintains a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and a cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep while still competing with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and maintaining a cautious approach is essential to allow their numbers to recover. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need for long-term sustainability, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and with a high wolf population, it is crucial to prioritize the recovery of sheep. A lower theta allows for competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to rebound, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta allows the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This cautious approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting, ensuring a balance that promotes long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This cautious approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach helps maintain balance and avoids over-depletion of sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A lower theta allows the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This gradual adjustment helps ensure long-term survival for both species.",

A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This gradual adjustment helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure on the sheep, allowing their numbers to recover while we adapt to the current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating that we need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep to ensure long-term sustainability. A gradual decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to rebound while still managing competition among wolves."
