            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while there are many sheep per wolf, we need to be cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate increase in hunting intensity allows for some reproduction among wolves while still giving the sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and a cautious approach is needed to allow them to recover. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both sheep and wolves, while still competing with other wolves to maintain a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need to focus on reducing competition among wolves rather than intensifying hunting. This will allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a stable wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is concerningly low, and the wolf population is relatively high. A lower theta will allow me to focus on reducing competition among wolves while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance in the ecosystem and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
