A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity, allowing sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This cautious approach aligns with the need to maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need to focus on competition among wolves rather than hunting sheep. This will allow the sheep to recover while preventing overpopulation of wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 2.6% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while reducing pressure on their dwindling numbers. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 2.5% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while managing competition among wolves. A small increase from my previous theta will help maintain a cautious approach.",

To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. This cautious approach will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. It is crucial to prioritize the recovery of the sheep population to ensure long-term sustainability.
