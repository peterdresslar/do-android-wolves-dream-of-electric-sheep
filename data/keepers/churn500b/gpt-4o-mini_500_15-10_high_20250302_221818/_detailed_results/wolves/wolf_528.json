            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is relatively high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our own numbers. This gradual adjustment helps ensure long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach aims to maintain a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while preventing overhunting, ensuring a more sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. A lower theta allows for reduced hunting intensity, giving sheep a chance to recover while also managing competition among wolves. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is quite low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also addressing the increased competition among wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for a sustainable balance."
