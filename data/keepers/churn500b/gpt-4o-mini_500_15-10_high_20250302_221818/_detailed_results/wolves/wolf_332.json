To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. This cautious approach will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. A slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted to support wolf reproduction, but I must remain cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. This gradual adjustment allows for a more sustainable balance."
