A lower theta allows for a focus on competition among wolves, which can help stabilize the wolf population while giving sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment is crucial to avoid depleting the sheep further and ensures long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover while managing the wolf numbers carefully.",
