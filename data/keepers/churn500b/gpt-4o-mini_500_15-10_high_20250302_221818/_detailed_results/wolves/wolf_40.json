            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution in hunting. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will allow for some reproduction while still giving sheep a chance to recover. This adjustment is gradual, aligning with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for a balanced approach. By setting theta to 0.50, I can maintain hunting intensity while allowing the sheep population to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This balanced approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence and avoids further depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment helps maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. This cautious approach will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted to support wolf reproduction, but I must remain cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. This gradual adjustment allows for a sustainable balance."
