            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for a balanced approach. By setting theta at 0.5, I can maintain hunting intensity while allowing sheep numbers to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain their numbers. This approach supports long-term sustainability and avoids depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. A moderate approach will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain their numbers. This gradual adjustment helps avoid overexploitation of the sheep and promotes a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. It is crucial to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while maintaining a cautious approach to competition among wolves. This will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover while also considering the competition among wolves. A gradual decrease in hunting will help maintain balance without risking a crash in either population."
