A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This cautious approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence.",

To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep population. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to replenish while managing the competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating that we need to focus on reducing competition among wolves while allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual increase in theta will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep further.",
