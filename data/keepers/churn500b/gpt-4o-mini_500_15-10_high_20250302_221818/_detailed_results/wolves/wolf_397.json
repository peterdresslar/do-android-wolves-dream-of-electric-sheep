A moderate theta allows for some hunting to support reproduction while also giving sheep a chance to recover. This balance is crucial for the long-term survival of both species.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A lower theta allows for a focus on reducing competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while preventing overexploitation. This cautious approach aligns with the need for long-term sustainability and balance in the ecosystem.",

However, with a high sheep-to-wolf ratio, there is room to increase hunting intensity slightly.

By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while maintaining a balance in the ecosystem.",
