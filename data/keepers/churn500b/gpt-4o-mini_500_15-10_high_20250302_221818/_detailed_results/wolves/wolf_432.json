This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments to ensure long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is relatively high, indicating increased competition among wolves.

This approach aligns with the goal of ensuring long-term survival for both species.",

Reducing hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure on the sheep, allowing their numbers to recover while still enabling some hunting for our needs. This gradual adjustment supports long-term balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep. By reducing hunting intensity, I can help ensure that the sheep have a chance to rebound, which is essential for the long-term survival of both our populations.
