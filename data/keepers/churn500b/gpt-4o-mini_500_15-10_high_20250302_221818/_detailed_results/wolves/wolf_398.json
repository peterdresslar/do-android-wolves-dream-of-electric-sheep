This approach balances the immediate need for food with the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we manage our numbers more sustainably. This gradual adjustment will help maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution. With the wolf population moderately high, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A lower theta allows for a focus on competition with other wolves, which can help stabilize the wolf population while giving sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment is necessary to ensure long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. A gradual decrease in theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance without risking a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for a sustainable balance.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low at only 8.3% of maximum capacity. A lower theta allows for a focus on competing with other wolves, which will help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep further and to ensure long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating a need for caution in hunting. However, the high sheep-to-wolf ratio suggests that there is room for increased hunting intensity without jeopardizing the sheep",

A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population.",
