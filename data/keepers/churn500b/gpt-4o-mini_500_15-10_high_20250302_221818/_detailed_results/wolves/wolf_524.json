This adjustment reflects the need to adapt to the current ecosystem state and avoid over-depletion of our prey.",

            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we manage our numbers more sustainably. This cautious approach aligns with the need for long-term survival and balance in the ecosystem.",
