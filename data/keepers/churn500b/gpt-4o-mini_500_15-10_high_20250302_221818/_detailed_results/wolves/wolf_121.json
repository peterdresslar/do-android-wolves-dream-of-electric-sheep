A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting, enabling some recovery for the sheep while still considering the needs of the wolf population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and a cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover.

To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. A moderate theta of 0.30 strikes a balance between competing with other wolves and allowing the sheep to stabilize.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while there are many sheep per wolf, we must prioritize the long-term survival of both species. A gradual increase in hunting intensity is warranted, but caution is necessary to avoid depleting the sheep further. This theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
