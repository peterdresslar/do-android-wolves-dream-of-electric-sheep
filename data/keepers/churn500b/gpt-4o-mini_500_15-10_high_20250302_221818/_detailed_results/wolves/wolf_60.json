A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This gradual adjustment will help ensure a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. A gradual adjustment will help maintain balance and avoid drastic declines in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A moderate hunting intensity allows for some hunting while also giving the sheep a chance to recover. This approach helps maintain a balance between the wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term survival for both.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 5% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population, which is essential for our survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and a cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from the previous theta, I can still support the wolf population while being mindful of the delicate balance in the ecosystem.",

This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",

A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to stabilize.",

However, I must remain cautious as the sheep numbers are concerning, so a moderate increase will help maintain balance while supporting wolf population growth.",

This will allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a sustainable wolf population.",
