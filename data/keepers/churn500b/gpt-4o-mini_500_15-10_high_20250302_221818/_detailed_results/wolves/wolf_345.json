            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition.

A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while reducing pressure on our own population. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 2.3% of its maximum capacity, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance in the ecosystem.",

To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. A gradual decrease in theta will help maintain balance and prevent overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable.
