            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution in hunting to allow sheep to recover. A moderate theta value will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while also reducing the pressure on the wolf population. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance in the ecosystem and avoids the risk of depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This gradual adjustment will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a sustainable balance within the wolf pack. This gradual adjustment will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 2.9% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves.
