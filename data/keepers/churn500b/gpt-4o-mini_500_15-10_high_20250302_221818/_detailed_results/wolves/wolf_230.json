            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. By reducing hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",

A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This gradual adjustment helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 2.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution in hunting. With a high wolf population, competition is likely to increase, and a lower theta allows the sheep to recover while we manage our numbers more sustainably. This gradual adjustment will help maintain balance in the ecosystem.",

A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population.
