            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that a more cautious approach is needed to allow their numbers to recover. A moderate theta value of 0.5 strikes a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability while still allowing for some hunting to support our population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf pack to sustain itself. This adjustment helps maintain balance and prevents overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is concerningly low, and with a high wolf population, competition is likely to increase. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain itself. This moderate approach helps ensure long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. By focusing on lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while ensuring that our wolf pack does not overextend itself. This cautious approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence and avoids potential crashes in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta allows the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This gradual adjustment helps ensure long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will allow sheep to recover while we focus on reducing competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment is crucial for maintaining balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution.
