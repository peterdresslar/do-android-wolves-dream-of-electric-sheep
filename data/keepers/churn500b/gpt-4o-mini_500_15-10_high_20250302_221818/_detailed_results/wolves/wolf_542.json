            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some reproduction among wolves. This approach helps maintain a balance in the ecosystem without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure on the sheep, allowing their numbers to recover while still maintaining a focus on competition with other wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while preventing overhunting, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 2.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution. With a moderately high wolf population, it is essential to focus on competition among wolves rather than intensifying hunting. This will allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem."
