            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the ecosystem and ensure that both populations can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and a cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while ensuring the sheep have a chance to thrive, which is essential for the long-term balance of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution. With a moderate wolf population, it is wise to focus on competition among wolves rather than intensifying hunting, allowing the sheep to recover and ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments to ensure long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution in hunting to allow sheep to recover while managing competition among wolves. A gradual increase from my previous theta will help maintain balance without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta allows for a focus on reducing competition and giving sheep a chance to recover, while still maintaining some hunting to support wolf reproduction. This gradual adjustment will help ensure a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow sheep to recover while we manage our numbers more sustainably. This cautious approach aligns with the need to ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need to focus on competition among wolves rather than aggressive hunting. This will allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a balance in the wolf population."
