A moderate hunting intensity will allow for some sheep recovery while still enabling the wolf population to thrive. This balance is crucial for long-term sustainability.",

A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on reducing competition among wolves. This approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence and avoids depleting the sheep further.",

This cautious approach will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted to support wolf reproduction, but I must remain cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further.
