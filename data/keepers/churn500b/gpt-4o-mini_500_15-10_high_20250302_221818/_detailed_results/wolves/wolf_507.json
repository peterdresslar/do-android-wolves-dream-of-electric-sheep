            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help stabilize the ecosystem and ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and a cautious approach is needed to allow their numbers to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while ensuring the sheep have a chance to rebound, which is crucial for the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating that a cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to rebound.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution in hunting. However, with a high sheep-to-wolf ratio, there is room for moderate hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A gradual increase from my previous theta will help maintain balance without overwhelming the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This cautious approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This cautious approach helps maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while also preventing overpopulation among wolves. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem."
