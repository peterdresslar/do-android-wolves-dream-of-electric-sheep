A slight reduction from my previous theta reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for hunting with the necessity of maintaining a sustainable ecosystem.",

A moderate approach will allow for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while giving sheep a chance to recover. This balance is crucial for the long-term survival of both species.",

A moderate theta value will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep further.",
