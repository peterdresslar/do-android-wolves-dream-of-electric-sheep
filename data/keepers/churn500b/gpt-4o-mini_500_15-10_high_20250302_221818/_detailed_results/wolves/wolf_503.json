            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 437\n- Sheep population: 48.15\n- Wolf population: 14.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.200\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 3.44 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 4.8% of maximum capacity\n\nEcosystem observations:\n- Sheep numbers are becoming concerning, suggesting caution may be needed.\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating that we need to be cautious about hunting intensity. A moderate increase in theta allows for some hunting to support reproduction while still giving sheep a chance to recover. This balance is essential for the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A moderate hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, allowing sheep to recover while ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. This adjustment is gradual, aligning with the wisdom of maintaining sustainable cycles.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution in hunting to allow sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support wolf reproduction. This balanced approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta allows for more focus on competition, giving sheep a chance to recover while maintaining a sustainable wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments to ensure long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. It is crucial to focus on reducing competition with other wolves to allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both species by promoting a more sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while being cautious about the wolf population. A lower theta will help maintain balance and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This cautious approach helps maintain balance in the ecosystem without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A moderate approach will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain stability. This gradual adjustment helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
