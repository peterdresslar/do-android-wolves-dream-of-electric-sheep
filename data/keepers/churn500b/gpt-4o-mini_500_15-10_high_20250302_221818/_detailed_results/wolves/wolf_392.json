A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain their numbers. This approach supports long-term coexistence and avoids depleting the sheep further.",

To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. A gradual decrease in theta will help maintain a balance and prevent further depletion of the sheep.",

A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
