            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and a cautious approach is necessary to allow for their recovery. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competition with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to stabilize and grow. This aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while avoiding a potential crash in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and a cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while ensuring the sheep have a chance to rebound, which is essential for the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and with a high wolf population, it is crucial to focus on competition among wolves rather than intensifying hunting. This will allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is concerningly low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A moderate hunting intensity allows for some hunting while giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while reducing the pressure on our own population. This cautious approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain their numbers. This approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence and avoids the risk of depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need to focus on competition among wolves rather than intense hunting. This will allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a balance in the wolf population."
