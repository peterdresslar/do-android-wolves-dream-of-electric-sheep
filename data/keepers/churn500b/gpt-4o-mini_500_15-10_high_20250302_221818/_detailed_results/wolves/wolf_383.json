            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain their numbers. This approach supports long-term sustainability and avoids drastic changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is quite low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while reducing pressure on our own population. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need to focus on reducing competition among wolves while allowing the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while reducing pressure on their dwindling numbers. This cautious approach aligns with the need for long-term sustainability and avoids potential crashes in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem."
