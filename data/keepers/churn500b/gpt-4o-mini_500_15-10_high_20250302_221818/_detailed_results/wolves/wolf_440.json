            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition.

This approach balances the immediate need for food with the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta allows for a focus on reducing competition and giving the sheep a chance to recover, while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population. This gradual adjustment helps ensure long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we manage our numbers more sustainably. This cautious approach aligns with the need to maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while reducing the pressure on our own population. This cautious approach aligns with the need for long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while being cautious about our own wolf population. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance without risking a crash in either population."
