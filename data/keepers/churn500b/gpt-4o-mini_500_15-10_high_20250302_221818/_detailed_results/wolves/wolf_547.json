This approach supports long-term sustainability and avoids drastic changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is quite low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep. A lower theta will allow us to focus on reducing competition among wolves while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
