            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is relatively high, indicating increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This gradual adjustment will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure on the sheep, allowing their numbers to recover while we manage our own population dynamics more sustainably.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. A moderate approach allows for some hunting while prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. A gradual decrease in theta will help maintain a balance without causing sudden disruptions in the ecosystem."
