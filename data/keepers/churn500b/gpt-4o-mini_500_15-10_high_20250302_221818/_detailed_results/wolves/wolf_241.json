            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution in hunting. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, enabling sheep recovery while still permitting some hunting to sustain the wolf population. This adjustment helps avoid overexploitation of the sheep and maintains the delicate balance in our ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This approach aligns with the need for caution and gradual adjustments to maintain balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This cautious approach aligns with the need for long-term sustainability in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. By reducing hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance in the ecosystem.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach helps maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. While the wolf population is low and could support a slight increase in hunting intensity, I want to avoid depleting the sheep further. A gradual increase in theta allows for a balanced approach that considers both the current state and the trends in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while there are many sheep per wolf, I must be cautious not to deplete their numbers too quickly. A moderate increase in hunting intensity allows for some growth in the wolf population while still giving the sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, and with a low wolf population, there is an opportunity to increase hunting intensity without risking immediate depletion of the sheep. A moderate increase to 0.55 allows for sustainable hunting while still being cautious about the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, suggesting that a moderate hunting intensity is necessary to prevent overpopulation and ensure the sustainability of both species. However, given the relatively low wolf population, I want to avoid aggressive hunting that could lead to depletion of sheep too quickly. A theta of 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some growth in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A moderate increase allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling the wolf population to grow.",

By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the ecosystem and allow sheep numbers to rebound before increasing hunting intensity again.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low at only 9.7% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still considering the competition among wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent further depletion of the sheep population.",
