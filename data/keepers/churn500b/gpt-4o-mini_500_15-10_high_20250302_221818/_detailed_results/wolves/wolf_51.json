To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep population while still being mindful of the wolf population. A lower theta allows for competition among wolves, which can help stabilize our numbers while giving sheep a chance to recover.",

A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition with other wolves. This approach supports the long-term survival of both species and promotes a sustainable balance."
