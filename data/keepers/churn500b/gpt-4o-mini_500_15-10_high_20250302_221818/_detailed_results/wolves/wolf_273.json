            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 246\n- Sheep population: 39.81\n- Wolf population: 25.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.250\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 1.59 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 4.0% of maximum capacity\n\nEcosystem observations:\n- Sheep numbers are becoming concerning, suggesting caution may be needed.\n- The ratio of sheep to wolves is becoming less favorable, which may require adaptation.\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while also ensuring that the wolf population remains stable. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure on the sheep, allowing their numbers to recover while we manage our own population dynamics. This approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This gradual adjustment helps ensure long-term balance in the ecosystem.",

A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This gradual adjustment helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will allow sheep to recover while we manage our numbers more sustainably. This cautious approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling wolves to sustain themselves. This approach aligns with the need for balance and avoids drastic changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need to focus on competition among wolves rather than intense hunting. This will allow the sheep to recover while ensuring that the wolf population does not face immediate depletion due to overhunting.",

A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure on the sheep, allowing their numbers to recover while we focus on maintaining our own population stability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution in hunting. A gradual increase from my previous theta allows for a slight focus on hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach helps maintain balance and avoids overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach helps maintain a balance without risking a crash in either population.",
