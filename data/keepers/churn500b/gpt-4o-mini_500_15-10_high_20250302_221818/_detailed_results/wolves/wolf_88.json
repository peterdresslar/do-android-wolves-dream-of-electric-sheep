            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain their numbers. This approach balances the immediate need for food with the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow sheep to recover while preventing overhunting, ensuring a more sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 3.1% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while reducing the pressure on their population. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance."
