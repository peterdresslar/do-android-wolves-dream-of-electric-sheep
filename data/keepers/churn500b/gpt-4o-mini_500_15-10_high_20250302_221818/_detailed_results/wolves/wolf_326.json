A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach aims to maintain a balance and avoid over-depletion of sheep.",

To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep population by reducing hunting intensity. This will help create a more sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
