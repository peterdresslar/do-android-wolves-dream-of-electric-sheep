            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 331\n- Sheep population: 39.64\n- Wolf population: 48.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.250\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.83 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 4.0% of maximum capacity\n\nEcosystem observations:\n- The wolf population is quite high, which may lead to increased competition.\n- Sheep numbers are becoming concerning, suggesting caution may be needed.\n- The ratio of sheep to wolves is becoming less favorable, which may require adaptation.\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

A moderate theta value will help balance the needs of both wolves and sheep, ensuring long-term sustainability without risking a crash in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help stabilize the ecosystem and ensure the long-term survival of both species.",

            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on reducing competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment is essential for maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain their numbers. This approach supports long-term sustainability and avoids depleting the sheep further.",

A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while reducing pressure on the wolf population. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",

A gradual decrease in theta will help maintain balance and prevent overexploitation of the sheep.",

A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep further and to ensure long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition, and the sheep population is low, indicating a need for caution. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population, ensuring long-term balance.",
