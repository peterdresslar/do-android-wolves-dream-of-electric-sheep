            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating that we need to be cautious with our hunting to allow sheep to recover while still maintaining enough intensity to support our own reproduction. A moderate increase in theta will help balance our needs without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain their numbers. This approach balances the immediate need for food with the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A moderate hunting intensity will allow sheep to recover while still enabling wolves to maintain their numbers. This approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence and avoids depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 2.5% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem."
