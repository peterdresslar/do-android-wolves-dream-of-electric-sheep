A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This cautious approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",

A lower theta will help maintain balance and prevent overhunting, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from my previous theta, I can help sustain the sheep population while still allowing for some hunting. This gradual adjustment will help maintain balance without risking a crash in either population.",
