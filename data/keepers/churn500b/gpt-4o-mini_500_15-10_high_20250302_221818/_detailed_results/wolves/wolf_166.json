            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need to reduce hunting intensity to allow sheep to recover. A gradual adjustment will help maintain balance and prevent overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This cautious approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need to focus on competition among wolves rather than aggressive hunting. This will allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a sustainable wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 2.5% of its maximum capacity, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. With a high wolf population, focusing on competition rather than intense hunting will allow the sheep to recover while preventing further depletion of their numbers. This cautious approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This cautious approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence."
