            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low at only 10% of its maximum capacity. While my previous theta of 0.655 allowed for some hunting, it is now crucial to adopt a more balanced approach to ensure the sheep can recover. A theta of 0.45 allows for moderate hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and the wolf population is moderately high. A lower theta allows for more focus on competition among wolves, which can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment is essential to ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while preventing overhunting, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure on the sheep, allowing their numbers to recover while we navigate the challenges of competition.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This cautious approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence."
