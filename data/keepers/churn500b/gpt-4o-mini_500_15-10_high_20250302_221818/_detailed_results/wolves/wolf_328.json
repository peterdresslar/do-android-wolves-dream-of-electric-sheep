            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta allows for reduced hunting intensity, giving sheep a chance to recover while still maintaining some level of sustenance for the pack. This gradual adjustment aligns with the need for balance and long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure on the sheep, allowing their numbers to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This cautious approach will help prevent a crash in both populations and promote long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 2.5% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta value will help maintain balance and prevent overhunting."
