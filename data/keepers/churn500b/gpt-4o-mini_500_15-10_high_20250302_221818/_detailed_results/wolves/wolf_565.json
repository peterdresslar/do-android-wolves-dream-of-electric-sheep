A lower theta allows for a focus on reducing competition and giving the sheep a chance to recover, while still maintaining some hunting to support our pack",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our own numbers. This cautious approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence and avoids depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers without depleting the sheep further. This cautious approach aligns with the need for long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need to reduce hunting intensity to allow sheep to recover. A lower theta will help balance competition among wolves while ensuring the sheep can regain their numbers, promoting long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is quite low at 31.78, which is only 3.2% of its maximum capacity. Given the high wolf population of 51, increasing competition among wolves is likely. A lower theta allows for more focus on reducing competition and giving the sheep a chance to recover, while still maintaining a slight hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure on the sheep, allowing their numbers to recover while still maintaining a focus on competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while preventing overhunting, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. This cautious approach will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem without risking a crash.",

A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting, ensuring that I do not deplete the sheep further while still allowing for some reproduction in the wolf population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence.",

To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. A gradual decrease in theta will help maintain balance without causing sudden crashes in either population.",

By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while still competing with other wolves. This approach supports the long-term survival of both species and avoids depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 5% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population, which is essential for the future of my pack.",

By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers. This aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
