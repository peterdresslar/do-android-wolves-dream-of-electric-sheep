            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution in hunting.

This balance aims to prevent depletion of the sheep population and maintain our pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. A moderate hunting intensity will allow sheep to recover while still enabling wolves to thrive without overexploiting the sheep resource. This approach promotes a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta allows for a focus on reducing competition and giving the sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need to reduce hunting intensity to allow sheep to recover. This will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem and prevent overexploitation of the sheep, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 2.5% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while managing competition among wolves. A gradual adjustment will help maintain balance without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while managing the wolf population. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure and promote a more sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting, which helps sustain the sheep population while still enabling some reproduction among wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable.
