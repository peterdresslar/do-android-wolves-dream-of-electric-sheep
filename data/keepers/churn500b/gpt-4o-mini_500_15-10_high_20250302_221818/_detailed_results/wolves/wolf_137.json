            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while I need to maintain a healthy wolf population, I must also ensure the sheep can recover. A moderate hunting intensity allows for some reproduction among wolves while giving sheep a chance to stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and with a high wolf population, it is crucial to focus on competition among wolves rather than intense hunting. This approach allows the sheep to recover while maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is relatively high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting to maintain our population. This approach balances the immediate need for food with the long-term sustainability of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This cautious approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence.",

A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This cautious approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem. This gradual approach will help prevent overexploitation of the sheep and ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on reducing competition among ourselves. This approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence and avoids depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is quite low at 3.2% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while managing the wolf population sustainably.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating that competition among wolves is increasing. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach aims to maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem."
