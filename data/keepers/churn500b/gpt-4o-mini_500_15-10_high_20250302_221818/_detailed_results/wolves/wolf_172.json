            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution.

This gradual adjustment helps avoid overhunting and supports long-term balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance in the ecosystem without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while reducing the pressure on the wolf population. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we manage our numbers more sustainably. This cautious approach aligns with the need to maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. This cautious approach will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting, which helps maintain the sheep population while still focusing on the competition with other wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a balance in the ecosystem."
