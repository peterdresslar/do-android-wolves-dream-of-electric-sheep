            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 327\n- Sheep population: 52.80\n- Wolf population: 59.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.250\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.89 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 5.3% of maximum capacity\n\nEcosystem observations:\n- The wolf population is quite high, which may lead to increased competition.\n- Sheep numbers are becoming concerning, suggesting caution may be needed.\n- The ratio of sheep to wolves is becoming less favorable, which may require adaptation.\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a sustainable balance. This gradual adjustment will help prevent overhunting and ensure long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This approach aligns with the need for caution and balance in the ecosystem.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 2.3% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while reducing pressure on their dwindling numbers. This cautious approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach helps maintain balance and avoids over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. A gradual decrease in theta will help maintain balance without causing sudden shifts in the ecosystem.",

While the wolf population is also low, I want to avoid overhunting and allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can stabilize.",

While the wolf population is low and could benefit from some increase in hunting intensity, I must prioritize the long-term survival of both species. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that supports wolf growth while still giving sheep a chance to recover.",
