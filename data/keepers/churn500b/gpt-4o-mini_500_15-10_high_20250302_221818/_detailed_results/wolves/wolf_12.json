While there are still many sheep per wolf, I want to avoid depleting the sheep population further. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while prioritizing the long-term balance of the ecosystem.",

By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while managing competition among wolves. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both species.",
