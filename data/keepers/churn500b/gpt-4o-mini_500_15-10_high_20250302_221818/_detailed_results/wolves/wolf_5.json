This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while the wolf population is also low, I need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep. A moderate approach allows for some hunting while still giving sheep a chance to rebound, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can allow the sheep population to recover while ensuring the long-term survival of both species. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while I want to allow for some hunting to support wolf reproduction, I must prioritize the long-term survival of both species. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while the wolf population is also low, it is important to prioritize the recovery of the sheep. A lower theta allows for competition among wolves, which can help stabilize our numbers while giving sheep a chance to rebound. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, and while I want to ensure the wolf population can grow, I need to be cautious about overhunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the balance and recovery of the sheep population.",
