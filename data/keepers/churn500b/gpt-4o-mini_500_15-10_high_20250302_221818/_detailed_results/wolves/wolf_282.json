A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain their numbers. This approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence and avoids drastic changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure on the sheep, allowing their numbers to recover while still maintaining some hunting for our needs. This gradual adjustment aligns with the goal of sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This cautious approach aligns with the need for long-term sustainability.",

To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",

A cautious approach is necessary to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a focus on competition among wolves.

A gradual decrease in theta will help maintain a balance while avoiding sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
