A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help sustain wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover gradually. This approach balances immediate needs with long-term ecosystem health.",

A moderate theta value will help balance our needs with the health of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating that competition among wolves is increasing. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some reproduction among wolves. This balance is crucial for the long-term survival of both species.",
