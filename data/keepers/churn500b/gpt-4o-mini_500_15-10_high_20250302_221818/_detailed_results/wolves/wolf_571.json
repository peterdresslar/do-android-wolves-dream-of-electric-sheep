A gradual decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain balance without causing sudden disruptions.",

A slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted to support wolf reproduction, but I must remain cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. This gradual adjustment allows for a more sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, at only 4.7% of its maximum capacity.
