            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating a need for caution in hunting. With the current sheep-to-wolf ratio becoming less favorable, a moderate approach allows for some hunting while also giving sheep a chance to recover. This balance supports the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while the wolf population is also low, a more cautious approach is needed to allow sheep to recover. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while still allowing for some growth in the wolf population."
