            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity, allowing the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on reducing competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 3.4% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash."
