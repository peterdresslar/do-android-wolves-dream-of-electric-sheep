A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure and give the sheep a chance to rebound, while also allowing the wolf population to stabilize without competing too aggressively.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while still competing with other wolves. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low at only 9.5% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep population. A lower theta allows for reduced hunting intensity, giving sheep a chance to rebound while also managing competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low at 10.2% of maximum capacity, indicating that a more cautious approach is needed. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.20 to 0.25, I can maintain some hunting intensity while allowing the sheep population to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of avoiding sudden changes and focusing on sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that a more cautious approach is needed to allow their numbers to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep while still competing with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This cautious approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and with a high wolf population, competition is increasing. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we manage our numbers more sustainably. This cautious approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is relatively high, indicating a need for caution in hunting. A gradual increase in theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population, ensuring long-term balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while reducing pressure on their dwindling numbers, ensuring a more sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta allows for reduced hunting pressure on the sheep, giving them a chance to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance in the ecosystem."
