            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 3.9% of its maximum capacity, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. With a high wolf population, increased competition is likely, so I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure and promote a more sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating that we need to focus on reducing competition among wolves while allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual increase in theta will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover, while also being mindful of the moderately high wolf population. A gradual decrease in hunting will help maintain balance without causing sudden disruptions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is moderately high. A slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted to support wolf reproduction, but I must be cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. This adjustment allows for a gradual approach to balance both populations.",

By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while still competing with other wolves. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both populations.",

By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help stabilize the ecosystem and ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
