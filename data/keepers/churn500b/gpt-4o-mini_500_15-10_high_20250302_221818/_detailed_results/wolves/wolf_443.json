            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution in hunting to allow sheep to recover while still maintaining a sustainable level of wolf reproduction. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach that can help stabilize both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A moderate approach will allow for some hunting of sheep while also giving them a chance to recover, promoting a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution in hunting. A moderate approach will allow sheep to recover while still enabling wolves to maintain their numbers without overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while reducing pressure on the wolf population. This cautious approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence and avoids depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. A lower theta allows for a focus on competition among wolves, which can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species and prevents overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting, ensuring that I do not deplete the sheep further while still allowing for some reproduction among wolves. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance in the ecosystem."
