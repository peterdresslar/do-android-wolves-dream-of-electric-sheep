This moderate intensity will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",

By lowering my hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both sheep and wolves while maintaining a balance in the ecosystem.",

A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure on the sheep, allowing their numbers to recover while we manage our own population dynamics more sustainably.",

This gradual adjustment is crucial to avoid depleting the sheep further and to maintain a balance in the ecosystem.",
