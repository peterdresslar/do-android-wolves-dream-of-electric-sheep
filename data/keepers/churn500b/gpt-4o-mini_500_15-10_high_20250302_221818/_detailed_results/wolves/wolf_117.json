            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This adjustment helps maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A cautious approach is necessary to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining some hunting intensity to support the wolf population. This moderate theta will help balance our needs with the health of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This cautious approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating that a cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to rebound, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating that we need to prioritize their recovery. A lower theta allows for reduced hunting intensity, which will help the sheep population stabilize while we focus on competing with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and a cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while ensuring the sheep have a chance to rebound, promoting long-term sustainability for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low at only 6.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensifying hunting. This will allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a healthy balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while ensuring that the sheep population has the opportunity to stabilize and grow.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, indicating a need for caution in hunting to allow their numbers to recover. However, with a high sheep-to-wolf ratio, there is room to increase hunting intensity slightly to ensure the wolf population remains healthy. A moderate increase to 0.45 allows for a balanced approach that supports both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while there are many sheep per wolf, we need to be cautious to avoid depleting their numbers further. A slight reduction in hunting intensity allows for some recovery while still maintaining a sustainable balance.",

            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain their numbers. This approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence and avoids drastic changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
