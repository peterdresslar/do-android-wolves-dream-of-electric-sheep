            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while my previous theta allowed for some hunting, I need to shift towards a more balanced approach to ensure the sustainability of both sheep and wolves. A moderate theta will help maintain the sheep population while still allowing for some hunting to support the wolf population.",

While the wolf population is moderately high, I want to avoid overhunting and ensure the long-term survival of both species. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and with a high wolf population, competition is increasing. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain their numbers. This approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence."
