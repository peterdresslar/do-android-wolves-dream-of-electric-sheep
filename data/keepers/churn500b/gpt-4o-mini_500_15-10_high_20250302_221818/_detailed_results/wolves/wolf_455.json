            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while preventing overexploitation. This cautious approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence and avoids drastic changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is quite low, and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population to ensure long-term balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and with the current wolf population being high, it is essential to focus on reducing competition among wolves. This will allow the sheep to recover and help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution in hunting. By slightly increasing my theta from the previous value, I can focus on competition with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover. This approach aims to create a more sustainable balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. This cautious approach will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This cautious approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while also considering the gradual reduction in wolf numbers. This cautious approach will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting, ensuring that I do not over-deplete the sheep while still allowing for some reproduction among the wolves. This gradual adjustment helps maintain a balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. It is crucial to focus on competition with other wolves to allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both species by preventing overhunting and allowing for a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating that a cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain some hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of both populations."
