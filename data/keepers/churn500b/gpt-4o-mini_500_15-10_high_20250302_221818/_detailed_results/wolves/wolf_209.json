A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance without risking a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition among wolves. The sheep population is low, and I need to prioritize their recovery to ensure a sustainable ecosystem. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to regain their numbers while managing the competition among wolves.",

A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance and avoids over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain their numbers. This approach supports long-term sustainability and avoids depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help the sheep recover while maintaining a sustainable wolf population. This gradual adjustment allows for a more balanced ecosystem.",

A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure on the sheep, allowing their numbers to recover while we focus on maintaining our own population stability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 2.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution in hunting. With a high wolf population, competition is likely to increase, so a lower theta allows for a focus on reducing competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance in the ecosystem."
