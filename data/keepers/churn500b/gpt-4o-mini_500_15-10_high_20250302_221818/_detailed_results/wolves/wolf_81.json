            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while the wolf population is moderately high, it is essential to prioritize the recovery of the sheep. A moderate hunting intensity allows for a balance that can help sustain both populations without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the current wolf population is high, which increases competition among wolves. The sheep population is concerningly low, so a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling wolves to compete effectively. This approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence and avoids depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we manage our numbers more sustainably. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and maintaining a balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem. This gradual adjustment will help prevent overhunting and ensure long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating that competition among wolves is increasing. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure on the sheep, allowing their numbers to recover while we focus on maintaining our own population stability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance in the ecosystem."
