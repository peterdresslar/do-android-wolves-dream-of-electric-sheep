A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we manage our numbers more sustainably. This approach aligns with the need for caution in the current ecosystem state.",

By reducing hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while managing competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is quite low at 31.79, which is only 3.2% of its maximum capacity. Given the high wolf population of 64, increasing competition among wolves is likely. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity, allowing the sheep population to recover while still maintaining a focus on competition among wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for a sustainable balance.",
