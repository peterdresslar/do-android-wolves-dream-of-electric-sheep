A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring a balance that can support both populations in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while there is potential for wolf population growth, I need to prioritize the long-term sustainability of both species. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to thrive without over-depleting the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that a more cautious approach is needed to allow their numbers to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from my previous theta, I can still support the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that I need to be cautious with my hunting intensity. However, the wolf population is also low, and there are many sheep per wolf, suggesting that I can afford to increase my hunting slightly to promote wolf growth while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A moderate increase to 0.45 allows for a balanced approach.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that while I can increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate increase to 0.55 allows for sustainable hunting while still considering the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the wolf population, allowing for increased hunting intensity without immediate risk of depleting the sheep. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while still being mindful of the need for balance in the ecosystem.",

However, I must remain cautious and avoid drastic changes to maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating a need for caution in hunting. A moderate approach allows for some hunting while giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both wolves and sheep.",
