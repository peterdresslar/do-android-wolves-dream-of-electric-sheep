            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while I need to maintain a healthy wolf population, I must prioritize the sustainability of the ecosystem. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and the wolf population is relatively high, indicating increased competition. A moderate approach will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain a healthy population. This adjustment is necessary to avoid depleting the sheep further and to ensure long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta allows for a focus on reducing competition while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. By focusing on competition among wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help the sheep recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This gradual adjustment allows for a more balanced ecosystem.",
