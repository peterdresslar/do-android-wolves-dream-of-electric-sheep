            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we manage our numbers more sustainably. This approach aligns with the need for caution and long-term balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need to focus on reducing competition among wolves while allowing sheep to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and promote long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is quite low at only 2.6% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while managing the wolf population sustainably.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the need to maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem."
