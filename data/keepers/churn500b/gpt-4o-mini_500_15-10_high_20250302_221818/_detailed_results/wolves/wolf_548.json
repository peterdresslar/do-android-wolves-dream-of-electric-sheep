            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of sheep. This adjustment aims to maintain balance and prevent overexploitation.",

            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a sustainable balance. This gradual adjustment helps prevent overhunting and supports long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. By reducing hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep. A gradual reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to stabilize while still enabling some reproduction among wolves."
