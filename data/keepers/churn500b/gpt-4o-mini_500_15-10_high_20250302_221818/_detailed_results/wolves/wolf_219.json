A lower theta allows for a focus on reducing competition and giving the sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is concerningly low, and the wolf population is relatively high, leading to increased competition. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain its health. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating that competition among wolves is increasing. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we manage our numbers more sustainably. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while preventing overexploitation. This cautious approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is quite low, and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting, ensuring a balance that supports both populations in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. By reducing hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while minimizing competition among wolves. This approach supports long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is quite low at 27.13, which is only 2.7% of its maximum capacity. Given the high wolf population of 49, increasing competition among wolves is likely. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta allows for reduced hunting pressure on the sheep, giving them a chance to recover while we manage our own numbers. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance and avoids depleting the sheep further."
