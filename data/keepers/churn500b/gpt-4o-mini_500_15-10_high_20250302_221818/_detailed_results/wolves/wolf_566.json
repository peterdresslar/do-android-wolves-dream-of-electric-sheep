To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep population by reducing hunting intensity further. This cautious approach allows for a sustainable balance while avoiding potential crashes in both populations.",

A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance and avoids depleting the sheep further.",
