This balanced approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments to ensure long-term sustainability.",

By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a sustainable wolf population.

By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while managing competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population.
