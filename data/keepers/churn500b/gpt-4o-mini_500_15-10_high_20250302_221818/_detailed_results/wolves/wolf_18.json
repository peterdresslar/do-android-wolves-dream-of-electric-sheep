            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and with the wolf population being moderately high, it is crucial to prioritize the recovery of the sheep. A lower theta will allow for a focus on competition among wolves, which can help stabilize the wolf population while giving sheep a chance to rebound.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. By reducing hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while managing competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This gradual approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A moderate theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting, giving sheep a chance to recover while still maintaining some hunting activity to support wolf reproduction. This balance is crucial for the long-term survival of both species.",

            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need to focus on reducing competition among wolves rather than intensifying hunting. This will allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a sustainable balance."
