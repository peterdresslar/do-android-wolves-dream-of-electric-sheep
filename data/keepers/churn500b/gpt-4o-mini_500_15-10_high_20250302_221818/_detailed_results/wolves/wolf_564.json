            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution in hunting. A moderate approach allows for some hunting while giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta allows for a focus on reducing competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our own numbers. This cautious approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is quite low at 3.7% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain balance and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity, allowing the sheep to recover while we manage our numbers more sustainably. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need to prioritize the recovery of sheep while minimizing competition among wolves. A lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both species and allow for a more sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 2.9% of its maximum capacity, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach aims for a sustainable balance without risking a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and a more cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while avoiding further depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A gradual increase in hunting intensity is necessary to ensure the survival of both species, but I must remain cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. This theta allows for a slight increase in hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. It is crucial to focus on competition with other wolves to allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both species by preventing overhunting."
