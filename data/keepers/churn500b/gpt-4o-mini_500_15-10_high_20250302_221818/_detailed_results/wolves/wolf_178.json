            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A lower theta allows for more focus on reducing competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment helps maintain a balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on reducing competition among wolves. This approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species and maintains a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is quite low at 3.2% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while reducing the pressure on the wolf population, promoting a more sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. This cautious approach will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance and avoids overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining some hunting intensity to support the wolf population. This moderate theta value will help ensure a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. It is crucial to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population. A lower theta will help prevent overhunting and promote a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating a need for caution in hunting. While the wolf population is low and could benefit from increased hunting, I must prioritize the long-term survival of both species. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some growth in wolf numbers while still being mindful of the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while the wolf population is also low, focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to recover.
