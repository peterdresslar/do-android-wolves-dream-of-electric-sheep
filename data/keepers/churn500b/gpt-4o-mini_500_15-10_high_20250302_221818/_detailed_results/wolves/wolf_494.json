            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 431\n- Sheep population: 36.06\n- Wolf population: 23.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.250\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 1.57 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 3.6% of maximum capacity\n\nEcosystem observations:\n- Sheep numbers are becoming concerning, suggesting caution may be needed.\n- The ratio of sheep to wolves is becoming less favorable, which may require adaptation.\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need to focus on competition among wolves rather than intense hunting. This will allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a sustainable wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A moderate theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting, enabling the sheep population to recover while still maintaining enough hunting to support wolf reproduction. This balance is essential for long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will allow sheep to recover while we focus on stabilizing our own numbers. This gradual adjustment helps maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need to focus on reducing competition among wolves rather than intensifying hunting. This will allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity, I can help maintain the balance without depleting the sheep further. This gradual adjustment allows for recovery while still addressing the competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem. This gradual adjustment helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. Reducing hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while also addressing the competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. By reducing hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This gradual adjustment helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This cautious approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance in the ecosystem without risking a rapid decline in sheep numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. It is crucial to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while minimizing competition among wolves. A lower theta will help maintain balance and ensure the long-term survival of both species."
