To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover, while also being cautious about the moderately high wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This cautious approach aligns with the need for long-term sustainability in our ecosystem.",
