This gradual adjustment aligns with the need for balance in the ecosystem.",

This gradual adjustment will help prevent overhunting and ensure long-term survival for both species.",

A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population.
