By setting theta at 0.5, I can maintain hunting intensity to support reproduction while allowing sheep numbers to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",

By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while managing competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance in the ecosystem.",

By focusing on competition among wolves, I can allow the sheep population to recover while ensuring our pack remains sustainable in the long term. This cautious approach aligns with the need to maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
