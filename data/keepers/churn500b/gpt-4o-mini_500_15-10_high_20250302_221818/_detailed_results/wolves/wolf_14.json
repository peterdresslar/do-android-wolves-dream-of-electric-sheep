            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that a more cautious approach is necessary to prevent depletion. While I want to maintain a healthy wolf population, I also need to ensure that sheep can recover. A theta of 0.75 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while I need to maintain a healthy wolf population, I must also ensure that the sheep can recover. A moderate hunting intensity allows for some reproduction among wolves while giving sheep a chance to stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution in hunting. A moderate approach allows for some hunting while also giving sheep a chance to recover, maintaining balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta allows for a focus on reducing competition and giving the sheep a chance to recover, while still maintaining some hunting to support our own population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This cautious approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species."
