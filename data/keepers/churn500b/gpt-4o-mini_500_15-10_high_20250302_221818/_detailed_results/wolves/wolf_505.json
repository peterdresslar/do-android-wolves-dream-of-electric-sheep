            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 440\n- Sheep population: 58.10\n- Wolf population: 12.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.250\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 4.84 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 5.8% of maximum capacity\n\nEcosystem observations:\n- Sheep numbers are becoming concerning, suggesting caution may be needed.\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain its numbers. This approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence and avoids drastic changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while preventing further depletion of their numbers. This cautious approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while reducing the pressure on our own population. This cautious approach aligns with the need for long-term sustainability.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta allows for reduced hunting intensity, giving sheep a chance to recover while managing the wolf population sustainably. This gradual adjustment aligns with the need to maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. By reducing my hunting intensity further, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population more sustainably. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",

A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population.
