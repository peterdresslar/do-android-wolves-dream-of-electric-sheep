            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is relatively high, indicating increased competition among wolves.

This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance in the ecosystem.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need to focus on reducing competition among wolves while allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual increase from my previous theta will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is quite low at only 3.0% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while managing competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the need for caution in our current ecosystem state.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A gradual decrease in hunting will help maintain balance without causing sudden disruptions."
