            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity, I can help maintain the sheep population while still allowing for some reproduction among wolves. This gradual adjustment will help avoid over-depletion of sheep and ensure a more sustainable balance.",

A lower theta allows for a focus on reducing competition and giving the sheep a chance to recover, while still maintaining some hunting to support our needs. This gradual adjustment is crucial for long-term sustainability.",
