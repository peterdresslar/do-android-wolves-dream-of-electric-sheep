            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can allow the sheep population to recover while ensuring our pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent further depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and it is crucial to prioritize their recovery. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to regain their numbers while still enabling the wolf population to compete and maintain stability. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while still competing with other wolves.

This approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, as we need to avoid depleting the sheep further while still considering the competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and a cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must prioritize the long-term survival of both species. A gradual increase in hunting intensity is not advisable at this moment, so a slight adjustment towards competition with other wolves will help stabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, indicating a need for caution in hunting to allow their numbers to recover. However, the high sheep-to-wolf ratio suggests that we can afford to increase our hunting intensity slightly to ensure our own population remains healthy. A moderate adjustment to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that a cautious approach is necessary to prevent further depletion. However, with a high sheep-to-wolf ratio, there is room for gradual increases in hunting intensity. A slight increase to 0.40 allows for sustainable hunting while still prioritizing the long-term health of both populations.",
