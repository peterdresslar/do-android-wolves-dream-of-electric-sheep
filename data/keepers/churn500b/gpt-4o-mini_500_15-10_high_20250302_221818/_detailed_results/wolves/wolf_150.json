            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution in hunting. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain the balance while allowing the sheep to recover without depleting their numbers further.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is concerningly low, and the wolf population is quite high, leading to increased competition. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, enabling the sheep to recover while still allowing for some hunting to sustain the wolf population. This gradual adjustment helps maintain a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta allows for a focus on reducing competition and giving sheep a chance to recover, while still maintaining some hunting to support wolf reproduction. This gradual adjustment helps ensure long-term sustainability for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure on the sheep, allowing their numbers to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This gradual adjustment aligns with the need for balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on reducing competition within our pack. This approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence and avoids depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 2.3% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash."
