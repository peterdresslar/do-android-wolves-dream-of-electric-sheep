A lower theta allows for more focus on reducing competition while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our own numbers. This cautious approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence.",

This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
