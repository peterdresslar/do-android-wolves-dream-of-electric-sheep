            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 370\n- Sheep population: 50.35\n- Wolf population: 69.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.200\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.73 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 5.0% of maximum capacity\n\nEcosystem observations:\n- The wolf population is quite high, which may lead to increased competition.\n- Sheep numbers are becoming concerning, suggesting caution may be needed.\n- The ratio of sheep to wolves is becoming less favorable, which may require adaptation.\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population and reducing competition among wolves.",

A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population.

A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure on the sheep, allowing their numbers to recover while we manage our own population dynamics. This cautious approach aligns with the need for long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is quite low at only 5% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. This suggests that I should focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. A gradual increase from my previous theta will help maintain balance without overwhelming the sheep."
