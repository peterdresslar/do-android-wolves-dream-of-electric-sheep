This approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence and avoids depleting the sheep further.",

A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on reducing competition among ourselves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",

This cautious approach will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem.",
