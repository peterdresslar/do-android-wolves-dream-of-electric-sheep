            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating that increased competition among wolves could lead to unsustainable conditions. A moderate hunting intensity allows for some sheep recovery while also addressing the competition among wolves. This approach aligns with the need for a balanced coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure on the sheep, allowing their numbers to recover while also managing competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while preventing overexploitation, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover while managing the wolf population sustainably.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating that competition among wolves is increasing. A theta of 0.25 allows me to focus more on reducing competition while still enabling some hunting to help sustain the wolf population. This gradual adjustment will help prevent a crash in the sheep population and promote a healthier balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to stabilize and grow, ensuring a sustainable future for both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is moderately high. A slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted to support reproduction, but I must remain cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. This gradual adjustment allows for a more sustainable balance."
