This gradual adjustment is essential for maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",

A lower theta will allow sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This cautious approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity, allowing sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
