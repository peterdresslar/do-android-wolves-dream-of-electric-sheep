            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A moderate hunting intensity will allow for some hunting while also giving sheep a chance to recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta allows for a focus on reducing competition and giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. By focusing on competition rather than intense hunting, I can allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a sustainable balance within the wolf pack. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This cautious approach ensures the long-term survival of both species and helps maintain a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. With the wolf population moderately high, it is crucial to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while avoiding overhunting. A lower theta will help maintain balance and ensure the long-term survival of both species."
