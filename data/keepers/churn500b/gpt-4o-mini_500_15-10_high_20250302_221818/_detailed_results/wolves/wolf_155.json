A moderate theta allows for some hunting to support reproduction while also giving sheep a chance to recover. This balance is crucial for long-term sustainability.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. By reducing hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while managing competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment will help maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and with the current high wolf population, it is essential to focus on reducing competition among wolves. This lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while maintaining our pack",
