            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for a balanced approach. A moderate theta allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some hunting to support wolf reproduction. This adjustment helps prevent over-depletion of sheep and reduces competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain its health. This approach balances the immediate need for food with the long-term sustainability of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain their numbers. This approach balances the immediate need for food with the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. By focusing on lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need to focus on reducing competition among wolves while allowing the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 2.3% of its maximum capacity, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. This cautious approach will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",

A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
