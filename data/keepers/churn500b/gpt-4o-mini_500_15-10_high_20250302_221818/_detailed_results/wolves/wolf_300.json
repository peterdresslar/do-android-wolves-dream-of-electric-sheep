            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This cautious approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is relatively high, leading to increased competition. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach aims to maintain a balance and avoid over-depletion of sheep, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the current wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while reducing pressure on the wolf population, promoting long-term sustainability.",

A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population.
