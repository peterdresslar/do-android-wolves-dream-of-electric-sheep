A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover. This adjustment is necessary to avoid depleting the sheep further and to ensure long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution in hunting. A moderate theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while also giving sheep a chance to recover. This balance is crucial for the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to thrive without depleting the sheep further. This balance is crucial for long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow sheep to recover while we manage our numbers more sustainably. This gradual adjustment helps prevent overhunting and supports long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while preventing overhunting, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. Reducing hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while also addressing the increased competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we manage our numbers more sustainably. This cautious approach aligns with the need to avoid depleting the sheep further and ensures long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance without risking a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being cautious about the wolf population. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted to support wolf reproduction, but I must remain cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. This gradual adjustment allows for a more sustainable balance."
