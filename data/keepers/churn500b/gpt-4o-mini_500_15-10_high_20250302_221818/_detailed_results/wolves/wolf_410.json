            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and a cautious approach is needed to allow their numbers to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to rebound. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and with a wolf population that is moderately high, it is crucial to prioritize the recovery of the sheep. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity, allowing the sheep to stabilize and grow, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure on the sheep, allowing their numbers to recover while we manage our own population dynamics. This cautious approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling us to maintain our population sustainably. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims to prevent a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on reducing competition among ourselves. This approach aligns with the need for long-term sustainability and avoids depleting the sheep further."
