            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution in hunting. A moderate theta allows for some hunting to sustain reproduction while also giving sheep a chance to recover. This balance is crucial for the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling us to maintain our numbers without overexploiting the sheep. This gradual adjustment helps ensure long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will allow sheep to recover while reducing the pressure on our own population. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will allow sheep to recover while reducing pressure on the wolf population, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the current high wolf population indicates increased competition. By reducing my hunting intensity further, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity, I can help sustain the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 2.5% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a potential crash."
