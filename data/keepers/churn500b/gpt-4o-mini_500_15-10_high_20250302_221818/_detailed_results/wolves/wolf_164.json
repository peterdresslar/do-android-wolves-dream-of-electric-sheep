            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain its health. This approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence and avoids drastic changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we manage our numbers more sustainably. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while reducing pressure on their dwindling numbers. This cautious approach aligns with the need for long-term sustainability and balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 2.3% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while managing competition among wolves. A gradual decrease in theta will help stabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is quite low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This adjustment helps ensure the long-term survival of both species without risking a crash."
