            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is quite low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. With a high wolf population, focusing on competition rather than aggressive hunting will help maintain balance and ensure long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the current wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while reducing pressure on the wolf population. This cautious approach aligns with the need for long-term sustainability and balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating that we need to focus on reducing competition among wolves while allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual increase in theta will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 2.3% of its maximum capacity, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent further depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating that a cautious approach is necessary to allow for recovery. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from the previous theta, I can still focus on competition with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating that a cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while ensuring the sheep have a chance to rebound, which is essential for the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution in hunting. While the wolf population is also low, a gradual approach allows for potential growth without depleting the sheep further. This moderate theta supports a balance that can help both populations recover sustainably.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution. With the wolf population being relatively low, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while the wolf population is also low, it is important to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate approach will help maintain a balance, ensuring the long-term survival of both species without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while I want to allow for some hunting to support wolf reproduction, I must prioritize the sustainability of the ecosystem. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting while still enabling the sheep population to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, indicating a need for increased hunting to prevent overpopulation. However, with the wolf population still relatively low, I want to ensure that my hunting intensity remains balanced to allow for sustainable growth of both populations. A gradual increase in theta to 0.45 reflects a cautious approach to hunting while still considering the long-term health of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, and with a low wolf population, there is an opportunity to increase hunting intensity without depleting the sheep too quickly. A moderate increase to 0.55 allows for sustainable hunting while still considering the long-term balance of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that while we can hunt, we must do so cautiously to avoid depleting their numbers further. A moderate approach allows for some hunting while still considering the long-term health of both sheep and wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating a need for caution. By lowering my hunting intensity slightly, I can allow the sheep to recover while still competing with other wolves. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to recover. This approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is concerningly low, and the wolf population is relatively high, indicating increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while reducing pressure on the wolf population, promoting long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a balance in the wolf population. This cautious approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is quite low at only 4.7% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will allow sheep to recover while preventing overhunting and ensuring the long-term survival of both species."
