By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the ecosystem and ensure that both sheep and wolves can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low at only 12.5% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must prioritize the recovery of the sheep. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, promoting a more sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is relatively high, leading to increased competition. By focusing on competition rather than intense hunting, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for long-term balance.",

A lower theta will allow sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This gradual adjustment will help ensure the long-term survival of both species."
