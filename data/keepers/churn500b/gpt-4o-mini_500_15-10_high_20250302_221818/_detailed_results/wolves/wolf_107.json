            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain their numbers. This approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence and avoids depleting the sheep further.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity, I can help stabilize the sheep population while still allowing for some competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a balance without risking a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This cautious approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted to ensure the wolf population can thrive, but I must remain cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. This gradual adjustment allows for a more sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. It is crucial to focus on competition with other wolves to allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both species while avoiding overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance in the ecosystem.",

To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover.
