This strategy aims to prevent overexploitation of the sheep and maintain a sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing the competition among wolves. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and a more cautious approach is necessary to allow them to recover. While the wolf population is also low, focusing on competition among wolves rather than intense hunting will help maintain balance and prevent further depletion of the sheep. This gradual adjustment will support long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A lower theta allows for a focus on competing with other wolves, which may help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
