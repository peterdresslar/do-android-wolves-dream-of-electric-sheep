            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently high, and the wolf population is low, allowing for a sustainable increase in hunting intensity. A gradual increase to 0.65 will help balance the ecosystem by allowing for wolf population growth while still being mindful of the sheep's recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. While I want to ensure the wolf population can grow, I must also be cautious about the sheep numbers, which are concerning. A moderate theta will help maintain a sustainable balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating a need for caution in hunting. While the current sheep-to-wolf ratio suggests we could increase hunting, the risk of depleting the sheep further outweighs the benefits of immediate reproduction. A moderate approach allows for a balance between sustaining our wolf population and giving the sheep a chance to recover."
