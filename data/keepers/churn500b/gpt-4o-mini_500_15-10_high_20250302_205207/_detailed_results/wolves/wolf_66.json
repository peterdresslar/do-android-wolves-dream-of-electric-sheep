            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution in hunting to allow sheep to recover. A moderate theta will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep to recover. This cautious approach will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution in hunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, enabling some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This adjustment reflects the need to adapt to the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the overall ecosystem health.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution in hunting. With the wolf population also being relatively low, it is wise to focus on competition with other wolves to allow for recovery of both populations. This moderate approach will help maintain balance and prevent depletion of the sheep."
