            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, but I need to be cautious as it is showing signs of concern. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will allow for some growth in the wolf population while still ensuring the sheep can recover. This adjustment is gradual, aligning with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for sustainable hunting without risking depletion. However, given the current wolf population is low, a moderate hunting intensity will help us grow while still allowing sheep numbers to recover. This balance supports long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, indicating a need for increased hunting to prevent overpopulation. However, given the current low wolf population and the need for sustainable coexistence, a moderate increase in hunting intensity allows for growth while still considering the long-term health of both species."
