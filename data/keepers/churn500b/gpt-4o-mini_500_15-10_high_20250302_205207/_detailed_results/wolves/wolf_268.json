            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity, I can still support the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover without depleting them further. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and with a high wolf population, competition is likely to increase. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This cautious approach aligns with the need for long-term survival and balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to their extinction. Maintaining a low theta allows for the possibility of sheep recovery while ensuring the wolf population does not deplete further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and a cautious approach is necessary to allow them to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from the previous theta, I can still focus on competition with other wolves while being mindful of the sheep"
