            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, indicating a need for cautious hunting to prevent overpopulation. However, with a low wolf population, I can afford to increase my hunting intensity slightly to promote growth in my pack while still allowing for sheep recovery. This moderate approach helps maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, indicating a need for increased hunting to prevent overpopulation. However, given the low wolf population, I want to avoid drastic changes and instead opt for a moderate increase to ensure sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still being cautious about the sheep numbers, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while there are many sheep per wolf, we need to be cautious to avoid depleting their numbers too quickly. A moderate approach allows for some hunting while still giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while there are many sheep per wolf, we need to be cautious to avoid depleting their numbers further. A slight reduction in hunting intensity allows for some recovery of the sheep while still enabling us to compete effectively with other wolves."
