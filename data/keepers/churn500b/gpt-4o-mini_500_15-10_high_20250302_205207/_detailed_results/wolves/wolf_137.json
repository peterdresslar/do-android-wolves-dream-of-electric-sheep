            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for a balanced approach. A moderate theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while also giving sheep a chance to recover. This strategy helps maintain a sustainable ecosystem without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is critically low, and with a high wolf population, competition is increasing. A lower theta allows for a focus on reducing competition among wolves while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This approach aligns with the goal of ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. This cautious approach will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. A lower theta allows for a focus on competition among wolves, which can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a balance and avoiding overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. A gradual decrease in theta will help maintain a balance while avoiding sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance in the ecosystem without risking a further decline in sheep numbers."
