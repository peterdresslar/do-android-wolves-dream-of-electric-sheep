            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, indicating a need for cautious hunting to prevent overpopulation while still allowing for some growth in the wolf population. This moderate adjustment allows for a balanced approach that supports both species in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while there are many sheep per wolf, I want to ensure that we don",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that I should exercise caution in hunting. However, the current sheep-to-wolf ratio suggests that there is still room for increased hunting intensity. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a more balanced approach, promoting sustainability while still addressing the immediate needs of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution in hunting to allow sheep to recover. A moderate theta value will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure on the sheep, allowing their numbers to recover while we focus on maintaining our own population sustainably."
