            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution in hunting to allow sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain balance while still addressing competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and with the wolf population being high, it is essential to focus on reducing competition among wolves rather than intensifying hunting. This will allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance without risking a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and a cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. With the current sheep-to-wolf ratio being unfavorable, focusing on competition among wolves rather than intense hunting will help stabilize the ecosystem and ensure long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. A lower theta allows for more focus on competing with other wolves, which can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to recover. Gradual adjustments are essential to avoid sudden impacts on the ecosystem."
