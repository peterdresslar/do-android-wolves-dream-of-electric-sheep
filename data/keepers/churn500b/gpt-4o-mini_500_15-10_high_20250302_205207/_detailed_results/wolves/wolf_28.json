            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while I need to maintain a healthy wolf population, I must also ensure the sheep can recover. A moderate hunting intensity allows for some reproduction among wolves while giving sheep a chance to stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while my previous theta allowed for some hunting, it is now crucial to focus on the sustainability of both sheep and wolves. A moderate theta will help maintain a balance, allowing sheep to recover while still enabling wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting, ensuring a more sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species and allow the sheep population to recover."
