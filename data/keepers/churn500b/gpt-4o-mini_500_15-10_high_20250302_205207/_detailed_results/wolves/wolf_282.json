            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. While I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf growth while still considering the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can allow the sheep population to recover while ensuring our pack remains stable. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and while it is tempting to increase hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population, ensuring long-term balance."
