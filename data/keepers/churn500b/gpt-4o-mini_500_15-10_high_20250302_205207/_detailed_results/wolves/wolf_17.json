However, the current sheep-to-wolf ratio suggests that we can still hunt moderately without jeopardizing our long-term survival. A theta of 0.65 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both sheep and wolves, while still competing with other wolves to maintain a healthy pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and a more cautious approach is needed to allow their numbers to recover. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep while still competing with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This cautious approach aligns with the need to ensure long-term survival for both species."
