            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and with the wolf population being high, it is essential to focus on reducing competition among wolves rather than intensifying hunting. A gradual increase in theta will allow for some hunting while prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta allows for a focus on reducing competition among wolves while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment is essential for maintaining balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and a higher hunting intensity could lead to their extinction. Maintaining a low theta allows for the possibility of sheep recovery while ensuring the wolf population does not deplete further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to their extinction. Maintaining a low theta allows for the possibility of sheep recovery while ensuring our wolf pack does not overextend itself in competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and my previous focus on competition has not allowed for recovery. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help balance the ecosystem while still being cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance."
