            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while there are many sheep per wolf, I need to be cautious to avoid depleting their numbers too quickly. A moderate increase in hunting intensity allows for some reproduction among wolves while still giving sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating a need for caution. A moderate approach allows for some hunting while prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population, ensuring long-term sustainability for both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species and maintains a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 2.9% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while reducing pressure on their dwindling numbers, ensuring a more sustainable balance in the ecosystem."
