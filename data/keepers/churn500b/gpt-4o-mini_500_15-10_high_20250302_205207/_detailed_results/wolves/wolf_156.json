            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, indicating that a moderate increase in hunting intensity is necessary to prevent overpopulation and ensure sustainable coexistence. However, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep too quickly, as the wolf population is still relatively low. A theta of 0.45 allows for a balanced approach that supports both wolf growth and sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that we need to exercise caution in our hunting to allow their numbers to recover. While there are many sheep per wolf, a more moderate approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both species without risking a crash in the sheep population."
