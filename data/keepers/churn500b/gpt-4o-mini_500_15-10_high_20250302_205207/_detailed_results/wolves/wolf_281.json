By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also ensuring that the wolf population does not decline too rapidly. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for a sustainable balance.",

By reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while still competing with other wolves. This cautious approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also considering the growth potential of the wolf population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and while I want to ensure the wolf population can grow, I must prioritize the recovery of the sheep. A slight increase in hunting intensity allows for some reproduction among wolves while still being cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further.",
