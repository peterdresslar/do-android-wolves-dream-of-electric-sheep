            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating a need for caution in hunting. However, with a high sheep-to-wolf ratio, there is room for increased hunting intensity without risking immediate depletion. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach that can support both wolf reproduction and sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. A moderate hunting intensity will help maintain the sheep population while allowing for some hunting to support wolf reproduction. This approach aims for a sustainable balance, avoiding overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow sheep to recover while still addressing competition among wolves. This moderate approach aligns with the goal of sustainable coexistence."
