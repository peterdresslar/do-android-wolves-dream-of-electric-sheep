            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for some increased hunting intensity without risking depletion. However, given the low wolf population, a moderate approach will help ensure our numbers can grow while still allowing the sheep to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support the growth of the wolf population while still being cautious to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A balanced approach is essential to ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently high, and with a low wolf population, there is an opportunity to increase hunting intensity without risking immediate depletion of the sheep. A theta of 0.60 allows for a balanced approach that supports wolf reproduction while still being mindful of the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, indicating a need for moderate hunting to prevent overpopulation while still allowing for the growth of the wolf population. A slight reduction from my previous theta will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. A moderate hunting intensity will help maintain our wolf population while giving sheep a chance to rebound."
