A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while reducing the pressure on our pack. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",

A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while reducing competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance in the ecosystem.",

To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. A gradual decrease in theta will help maintain balance without causing sudden disruptions."
