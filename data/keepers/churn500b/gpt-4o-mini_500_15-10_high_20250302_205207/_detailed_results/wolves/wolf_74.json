            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for some hunting without risking depletion. However, given the current low wolf population and the concerning sheep numbers, a moderate approach is necessary to ensure sustainability and avoid overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the wolf population, allowing for a sustainable increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still being cautious about the sheep numbers, ensuring we do not deplete their population too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, indicating a need for cautious hunting to prevent overpopulation and ensure sustainability. However, with a relatively low wolf population, I want to maintain some hunting intensity to support our growth. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach that can adapt to future changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution in hunting. With a high wolf population, competition is likely increasing, so a lower theta allows for a focus on maintaining balance and giving sheep a chance to recover. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both species."
