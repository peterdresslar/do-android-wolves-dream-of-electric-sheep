            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and the wolf population is low, indicating an opportunity for increased hunting intensity. However, I must remain cautious to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A moderate increase to 0.60 allows for sustainable hunting while still considering the long-term balance of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A moderate increase allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling the wolf population to grow.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating a need for caution in hunting. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, enabling the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. This adjustment reflects the current state of the ecosystem and aims to prevent further depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both sheep and wolves while maintaining a balance in the ecosystem."
