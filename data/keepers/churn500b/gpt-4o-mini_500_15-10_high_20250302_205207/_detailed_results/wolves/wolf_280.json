With a high wolf population, competition is increasing, and focusing on reducing hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a sustainable balance for our pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. By reducing my hunting intensity further, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This cautious approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",

A small increase from my previous theta will help maintain a cautious approach, ensuring that we do not deplete the sheep further while still allowing for some reproduction in our pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also ensuring the wolf population does not decline too rapidly. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for a sustainable balance.",
