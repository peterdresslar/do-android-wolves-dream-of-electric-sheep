            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, indicating a need for caution in hunting to allow for recovery. However, with the wolf population also being low, a slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted to promote growth while still prioritizing the long-term balance of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and while my previous theta allowed for some hunting, the current state indicates a need for caution. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help the sheep recover, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem. This gradual adjustment will allow for long-term survival of both species."
