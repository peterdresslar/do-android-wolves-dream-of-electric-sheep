            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, suggesting that a more cautious approach is needed to allow for recovery while still maintaining a balance. A moderate theta of 0.5 allows for some hunting to support the wolf population, but it also prioritizes the sustainability of the sheep, ensuring that both populations can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. A moderate theta value will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and a more cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep while still competing with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem."
