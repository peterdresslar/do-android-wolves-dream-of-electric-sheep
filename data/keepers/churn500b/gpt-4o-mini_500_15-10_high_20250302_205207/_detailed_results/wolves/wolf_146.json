A moderate theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while also giving sheep a chance to recover. This balance is crucial for the long-term survival of both species.",

A moderate theta will help maintain a balance and prevent further depletion of the sheep, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",

By reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also addressing the growing competition among wolves. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
