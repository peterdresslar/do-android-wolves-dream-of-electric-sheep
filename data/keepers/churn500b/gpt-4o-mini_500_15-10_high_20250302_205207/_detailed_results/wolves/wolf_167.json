            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while there are many sheep per wolf, it is crucial to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate approach will help maintain a balance, ensuring the long-term survival of both species without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and with a high sheep-to-wolf ratio, it is crucial to prioritize the recovery of the sheep. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while allowing the sheep population to stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A theta of 0.30 allows for a cautious approach, focusing on reducing competition while giving sheep a chance to recover. This balance is essential for long-term sustainability."
