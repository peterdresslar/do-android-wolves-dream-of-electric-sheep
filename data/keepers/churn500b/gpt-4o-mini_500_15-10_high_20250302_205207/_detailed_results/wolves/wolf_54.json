            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to compete effectively. This moderate approach helps maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. This cautious approach will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
