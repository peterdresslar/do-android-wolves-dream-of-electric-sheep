A moderate increase in hunting intensity allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling us to maintain our population.",

A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to thrive. This approach balances the immediate need for food with the long-term sustainability of both populations."
