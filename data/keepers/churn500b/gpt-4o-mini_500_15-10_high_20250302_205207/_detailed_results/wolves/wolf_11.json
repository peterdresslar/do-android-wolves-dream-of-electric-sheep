            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for some increased hunting without risking depletion.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and while we can afford to hunt more, caution is necessary to prevent over-depletion. A moderate increase allows for sustainable hunting while still considering the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, indicating that while I can increase hunting intensity, I must do so cautiously to avoid depleting their numbers too quickly. A moderate approach allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling the wolf population to grow.",
            "I chose this theta because while the sheep population is concerningly low, the high sheep-to-wolf ratio suggests that I can still hunt without depleting their numbers too quickly. A slight reduction from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach, balancing the need for hunting with the necessity of allowing the sheep population to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain their numbers. This approach supports sustainable coexistence and avoids over-depleting the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. By focusing on competition rather than intense hunting, I can allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a stable wolf population. This gradual adjustment will help ensure long-term survival for both species."
