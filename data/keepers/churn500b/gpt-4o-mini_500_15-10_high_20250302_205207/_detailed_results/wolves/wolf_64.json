            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a sustainable wolf population. This gradual adjustment will help avoid overhunting and ensure long-term balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. It is essential to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both species by preventing further depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This cautious approach aligns with the need for balance and sustainability."
