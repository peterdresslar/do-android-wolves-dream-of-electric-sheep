            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while my previous theta allowed for intense hunting, it is now crucial to adopt a more balanced approach. A moderate theta will help maintain the sheep population while still allowing for some hunting to support the wolf population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A moderate hunting intensity will allow sheep to recover while still enabling wolves to sustain themselves. This approach helps maintain a balance in the ecosystem without risking a crash."
