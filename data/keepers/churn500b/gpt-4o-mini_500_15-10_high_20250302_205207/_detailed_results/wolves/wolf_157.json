            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for some hunting without risking depletion. However, given the current low wolf population, a slight decrease from my previous theta will help maintain a balance while still allowing for growth in our numbers. This approach supports sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that a more cautious approach is needed to allow their numbers to recover. While there are many sheep per wolf, I want to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A moderate hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, ensuring both the wolf and sheep populations can thrive in the long term."
