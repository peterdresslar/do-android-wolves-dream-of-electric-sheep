            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.5% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This value balances the need for wolf reproduction while ensuring that the sheep population can recover sustainably.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 62.31, which is only 6.2% of its maximum capacity. While my previous theta of 0.650 was effective, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.31, which is only 1.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting sheep. This will allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a healthy balance in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help the sheep population rebound while ensuring the wolf population remains stable. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent further depletion of sheep."
