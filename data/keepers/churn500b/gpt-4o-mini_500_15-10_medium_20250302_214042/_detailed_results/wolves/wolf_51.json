            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and a moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain the balance between wolf and sheep populations. This adjustment allows for some growth in the wolf population while still ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.5% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a focus on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting. This will help the sheep recover while also ensuring that our wolf population remains stable. A gradual adjustment towards lower hunting intensity will promote a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are more sheep available per wolf. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a bit more hunting to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious to avoid depleting the sheep population further. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 62.31, which is only 6.2% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 3.6% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain balance and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.94, which is only 2.1% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a slight hunting intensity. A moderate increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will help balance the needs of the wolf population without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 1.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity and give the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, while also managing competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By focusing more on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help the sheep population stabilize and eventually grow, ensuring long-term survival for both species. This gradual adjustment allows for a more sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.7% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover while still maintaining a presence in the ecosystem.
