            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I need to ensure my pack can thrive, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.63, which is only 1.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover rather than intensifying our hunting. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 to 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for wolf population sustainability while giving sheep a chance to rebound.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.87, which is only 1.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are in a vulnerable state, and while I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must prioritize the recovery of the sheep. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.18, which is only 2.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By setting a lower theta, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.32, which is only 2.3% of its maximum capacity. While I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. A slight increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting sustainable coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.15, which is only 2.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover rather than intensifying our hunting. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.4 to 0.35 will help maintain a balance while still allowing for some hunting, as the wolf population is stable at 5.00. This approach supports the long-term survival of both species."
