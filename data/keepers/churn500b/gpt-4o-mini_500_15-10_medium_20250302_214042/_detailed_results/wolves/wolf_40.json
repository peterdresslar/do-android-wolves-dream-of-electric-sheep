            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 15.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for increased hunting without risking immediate depletion. However, given the current wolf population and the need to maintain a balance, a moderate increase to 0.6 allows for sustainable hunting while still considering the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 62.31, which is only 6.2% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.94, which is only 2.1% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting sheep. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.45 to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach that supports both wolf and sheep populations without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.3% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, it is crucial to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population, which would ultimately harm the wolf population as well.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.7% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover while preventing overcompetition among wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments to ensure the long-term survival of both species."
