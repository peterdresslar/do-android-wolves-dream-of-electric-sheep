            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 62.31, which is only 6.2% of its maximum capacity. While my previous theta of 0.626 indicates a focus on hunting, I need to adjust it slightly downward to ensure the sheep can recover. This moderate value allows for some hunting while also considering the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low at 0.09. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. A moderate theta of 0.40 will help balance the need for wolves to compete with each other while still allowing for some hunting, promoting a sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.4% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a healthy balance within our wolf pack. This gradual adjustment will help ensure the long-term survival of both species."
