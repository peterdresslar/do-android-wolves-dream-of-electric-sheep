            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a sustainable balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.3% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This balance will help sustain both the wolf and sheep populations while adapting to the current ecosystem state.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level (15.9% of maximum capacity), indicating that they are vulnerable. A moderate hunting intensity will allow for some sheep population recovery while still enabling my pack to thrive. This approach balances the need for sustenance with the long-term health of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 16.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 24, it is wise to maintain a cautious approach to avoid over-depleting the sheep. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced strategy that supports both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 14.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 48, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both populations can thrive. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the balance needed for long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are more sheep available per wolf. This suggests a need for a cautious approach to allow the sheep population to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing competition among wolves, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 3.6% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain balance and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.94, which is only 2.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are in a vulnerable state, and while I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must prioritize the recovery of the sheep. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, promoting a sustainable balance."
