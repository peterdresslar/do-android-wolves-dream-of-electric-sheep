            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A balanced approach is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly while still allowing for wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 62.31, which is only 6.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is a need for a more cautious approach to hunting, allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support the wolf population. A theta of 0.40 strikes a balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep, promoting sustainability."
