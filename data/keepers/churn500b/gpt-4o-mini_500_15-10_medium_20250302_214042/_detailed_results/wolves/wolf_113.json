A moderate approach allows for some hunting while giving sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.4% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. This indicates that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow the sheep population to recover while still enabling some hunting for the sustenance of the wolf pack. A slight increase from my previous theta will help balance the need for food with the necessity of allowing the sheep to rebound.",
