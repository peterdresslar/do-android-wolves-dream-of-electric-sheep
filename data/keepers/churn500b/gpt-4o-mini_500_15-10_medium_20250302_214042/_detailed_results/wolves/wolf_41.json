            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.7% of maximum capacity, allowing for a gradual increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate approach will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 94.88, which is only 9.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 36.22, which is only 3.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both populations. It also acknowledges the growing wolf population, which requires careful management to avoid over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.3% of its maximum capacity, and with a high wolf population, it is crucial to focus on competition among wolves rather than hunting sheep. This will allow the sheep to recover while ensuring that our wolf pack remains healthy in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.9% of its maximum capacity, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both species by focusing on competition among wolves rather than depleting the already scarce sheep population."
