            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This balance will help sustain both the sheep and wolf populations while allowing for gradual adjustments as conditions change.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their depletion. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep population to recover while ensuring the long-term survival of both species. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the wolf population is relatively high. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a bit more hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment helps maintain a balance and avoids depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. This approach will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem."
