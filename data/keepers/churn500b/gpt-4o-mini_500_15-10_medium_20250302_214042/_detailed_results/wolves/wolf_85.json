            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that they need some time to recover. While my previous theta of 0.540 allowed for moderate hunting, I believe a slight reduction to 0.45 will help maintain a balance between hunting and allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This approach will support the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, avoiding overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 62.31, which is only 6.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity and promote a more sustainable balance between the two populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 1.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help the sheep population stabilize while also managing the competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. A gradual approach will help maintain a balance without risking a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 0.4% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A theta of 0.30 allows for a gradual approach to competition with other wolves, which can help stabilize our numbers without depleting the sheep further."
