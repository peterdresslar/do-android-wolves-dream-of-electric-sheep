            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 62.31, which is only 6.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover, and focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to regain their numbers while preventing overhunting. A gradual increase in theta will be necessary as the sheep population grows, but for now, a lower value will help maintain balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.94, which is only 2.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.25 to 0.30, I can maintain a focus on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, promoting a more sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.9% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent further depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta will help balance the need for hunting with the necessity of sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low at 0.09. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both species while preventing overhunting."
