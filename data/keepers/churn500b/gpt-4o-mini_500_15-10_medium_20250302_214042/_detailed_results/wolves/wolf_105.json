        "explanations": [
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 62.31, which is only 6.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is an opportunity to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A moderate increase to 0.4 maintains a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 0.7% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and my previous theta of 0.300 was already focused on competition rather than hunting. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I will gradually increase my hunting intensity to 0.35, allowing for a slight increase in hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.4% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable for hunting. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while also addressing the competition among wolves. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and my previous theta was already on the lower end. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for a bit more hunting to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep further. This gradual adjustment aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 4.78, which is only 0.5% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting intensely. This will help balance the populations and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 5.05, which is only 0.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a slight hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A small increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a gradual adjustment that respects the delicate balance of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.5% of maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain balance and prevent overhunting."
