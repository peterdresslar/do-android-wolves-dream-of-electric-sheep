            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 62.31, which is only 6.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that supports both wolf reproduction and the recovery of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 3.6% of maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain some hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 1.3% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain a balance and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 5.77, which is only 0.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 to 0.35 reflects a cautious approach to balance competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to support wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.4% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both species by preventing overhunting and allowing for a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.4% of maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring that both populations can stabilize and recover."
