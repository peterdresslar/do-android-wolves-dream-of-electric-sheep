            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 63\n- Sheep population: 8.28\n- Wolf population: 4.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.400\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 2.07 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 0.8% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 3.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are not enough sheep to sustain intense hunting. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while also giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring a balance that supports both populations in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their depletion. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a significant competition for resources among wolves. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also reducing competition among wolves, ensuring a more sustainable ecosystem in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the wolf population is relatively high. A lower theta allows me to focus on competing with other wolves, which will help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and a more moderate hunting intensity will allow for some recovery while still enabling us to compete effectively with other wolves. This small increase from my previous theta reflects the need to adapt to the current conditions without risking a drastic decline in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.4% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 5.05, which is only 0.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting to support the wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a cautious approach to hunting without risking the depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are not enough sheep to sustain intense hunting. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep population to recover while ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and my previous theta was already on the lower end. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for a modest increase in hunting intensity, which can help sustain my pack while still allowing the sheep population to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 6.58, which is only 0.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is a need for cautious hunting to allow the sheep to recover while still ensuring that the wolf population remains healthy. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting sustainable coexistence without over-depleting the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 7.08, which is only 0.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a moderate approach, balancing the need to compete with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to support our population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 7.64, which is only 0.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is an opportunity to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A gradual increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, ensuring we do not deplete the sheep further while also considering the growing wolf population.",
