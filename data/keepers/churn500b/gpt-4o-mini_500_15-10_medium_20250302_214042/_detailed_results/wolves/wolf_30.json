            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are more sheep available for hunting. However, to ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to maintain a balance that allows for sheep recovery while also considering the growing wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.3 allows for some hunting while prioritizing competition with other wolves, which can help stabilize our numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I need to focus on hunting to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 3.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a scarcity of prey. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can allow the sheep population to recover while ensuring the long-term survival of both species. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of my ancestors, promoting a sustainable balance."
