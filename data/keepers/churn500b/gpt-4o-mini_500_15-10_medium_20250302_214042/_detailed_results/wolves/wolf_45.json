            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.5% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This value balances the need to sustain our wolf population while allowing sheep to recover, ensuring long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 36.22, which is only 3.6% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population. A lower theta value will help reduce hunting intensity and promote a more sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 9.18, which is only 0.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are under significant pressure. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing competition with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for a sustainable balance."
