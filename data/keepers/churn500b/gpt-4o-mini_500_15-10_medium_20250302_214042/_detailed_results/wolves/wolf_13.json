            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.3% of maximum capacity, and my previous theta was very low at 0.021. To allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a focus on competition with other wolves, a gradual increase to 0.25 will help balance the ecosystem without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 159.48, which is only 15.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some recovery in the sheep population while still ensuring the wolf population can sustain itself. A moderate increase in theta will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain the balance between wolf and sheep populations while ensuring that we do not over-deplete the sheep resources. A gradual increase will also help support our wolf population without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 62.31, which is only 6.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.4 to 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain my pack"
