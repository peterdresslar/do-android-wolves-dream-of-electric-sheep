            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 62.31, which is only 6.2% of its maximum capacity. While my previous theta was high, indicating intense hunting, I need to shift towards a more balanced approach to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.65 will help maintain a sustainable coexistence while still allowing for some hunting to support the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.94, which is only 2.1% of its maximum capacity. While my previous theta of 0.650 allowed for some hunting, it is crucial to shift towards a more balanced approach to allow the sheep population to recover. A theta of 0.40 reflects a moderate hunting intensity that can help sustain both populations while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta will allow for some hunting without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to replenish while also addressing the competition among wolves. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and my previous theta of 0.3 was focused on competition with other wolves. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to gradually increase my hunting intensity to help the wolf population thrive while still allowing the sheep to recover. A small increase to 0.35 strikes a balance between hunting and competition, promoting sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain balance and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta will help balance the need for hunting with the necessity of allowing sheep to repopulate, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to replenish while also managing competition among wolves. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both populations."
