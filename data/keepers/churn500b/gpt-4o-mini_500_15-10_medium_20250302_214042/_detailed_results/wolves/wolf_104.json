            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.18, which is only 0.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are struggling, and a more moderate hunting intensity will allow them to recover while still enabling my pack to maintain a healthy population. By adjusting to a balanced approach, I can ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.35, I can focus more on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to gradually recover. This approach aligns with my objective of ensuring long-term survival for both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to increase. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance."
