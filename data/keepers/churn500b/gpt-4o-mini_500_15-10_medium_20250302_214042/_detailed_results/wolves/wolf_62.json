            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 62.31, which is only 6.2% of its maximum capacity. While I need to maintain a balance to ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I can afford to increase my hunting intensity slightly to help sustain the wolf population. A theta of 0.6 allows for moderate hunting while still considering the need for sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 36.22, which is only 3.6% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.45 strikes a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting coexistence while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 0.9% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the survival of my pack, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure, giving the sheep a chance to rebound while still allowing for some competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to recover. This approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species while maintaining a balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. This will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem."
