            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain our wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is necessary to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level (15.9% of maximum capacity), allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This value balances the need to sustain our wolf population while allowing sheep to recover. It reflects a cautious approach, considering both the current state and the trends in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.5% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. However, with the wolf population at 65, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting, so a moderate approach is best to ensure sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.5% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 62.31, which is only 6.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance."
