            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 3.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for increased hunting without risking immediate depletion. However, since the wolf population is relatively high, a moderate approach will help maintain balance and prevent overexploitation of the sheep. This theta allows for sustainable hunting while considering the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.31, which is only 1.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.40 allows for some hunting while prioritizing competition among wolves, which is necessary given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.14.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help the sheep population stabilize and gradually increase, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a significant competition for resources among wolves. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a bit more hunting to support reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. Focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep population to recover, ensuring long-term survival for both species. A gradual approach is necessary to avoid sudden crashes."
