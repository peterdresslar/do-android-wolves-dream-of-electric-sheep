            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 62.31, which is only 6.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.15 to 0.25 reflects a slight shift towards competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.94, which is only 2.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, promoting a balance that supports both populations in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.9% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable for hunting. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also reducing competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment will help ensure the long-term survival of both species."
