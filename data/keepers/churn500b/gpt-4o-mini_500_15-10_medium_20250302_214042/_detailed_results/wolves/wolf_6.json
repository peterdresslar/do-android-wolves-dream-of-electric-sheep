            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.87, which is only 1.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting a theta of 0.40, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This moderate approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species and avoids depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.18, which is only 2.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to help sustain our wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.68, which is only 2.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack without depleting the sheep further, promoting a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I need to ensure the survival of my pack, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.15, which is only 2.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to stabilize while still competing with other wolves. This moderate approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.14, which is only 2.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 29.37, which is only 2.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for wolf survival with the necessity of not depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.85, which is only 3.2% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase in hunting intensity to 0.40 will help maintain a balance, allowing for some reproduction among wolves while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.47, which is only 3.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further.
