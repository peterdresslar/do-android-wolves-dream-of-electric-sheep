            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 15.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 34, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both populations can thrive. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.94, which is only 2.1% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.3% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and promote sustainable cycles."
