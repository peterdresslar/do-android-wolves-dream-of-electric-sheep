            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.9% of maximum capacity, and my previous theta was quite low at 0.245. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I will gradually increase my hunting intensity to allow for some recovery of the sheep population while still being cautious about the growing wolf population. This moderate adjustment helps maintain a balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.31, which is only 1.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. However, with a wolf population of 96, I need to slightly increase my hunting intensity to ensure the wolves can sustain themselves without depleting the sheep too quickly. A gradual increase to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach."
