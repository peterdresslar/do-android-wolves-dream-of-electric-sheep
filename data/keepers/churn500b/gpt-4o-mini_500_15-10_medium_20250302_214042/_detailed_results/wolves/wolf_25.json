            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain our wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 12.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, enabling us to maintain our wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are more sheep available per wolf. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, enabling me to hunt enough to sustain my pack while also allowing the sheep population to recover. This strategy aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 62.31, which is only 6.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to gradually increase while maintaining a healthy balance within our wolf pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at only 3.6% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help achieve this balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.94, which is only 2.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach that acknowledges the need for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term survival of both species. This gradual adjustment helps maintain a sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.3% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. A lower theta will help create a sustainable balance."
