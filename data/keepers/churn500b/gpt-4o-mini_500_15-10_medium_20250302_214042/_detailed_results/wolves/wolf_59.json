            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 3.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that they need some time to recover. While my previous theta of 0.796 was effective for reproduction, it is now prudent to moderate my hunting intensity to allow the sheep to bounce back. A theta of 0.65 strikes a balance between hunting and sustainability, ensuring that both wolves and sheep can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their depletion. By adopting a moderate theta of 0.40, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can allow the sheep population to stabilize and grow, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and my previous theta was already on the lower end. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for a modest increase in hunting intensity, which can help support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their extinction. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population a chance to recover while ensuring the long-term survival of both species."
