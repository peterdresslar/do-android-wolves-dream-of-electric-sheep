While I need to ensure the survival of my pack, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.4 allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the sustainability of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.7% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance while still being cautious.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.4% of its maximum capacity. Focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to recover, ensuring a sustainable future for both species. A gradual approach is essential to avoid drastic impacts on the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 0.4% of its maximum capacity. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover and increases the chances of sustainable coexistence. Additionally, with a wolf population of 36, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and a slight increase in hunting intensity will help sustain our wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover. This moderate adjustment reflects a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.4% of maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover while competing with other wolves. This lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and my previous theta of 0.300 was focused on competition with other wolves. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to gradually increase my hunting intensity while still being cautious, allowing the sheep population to recover without depleting it too quickly. A slight increase to 0.35 reflects a balanced approach that considers both the current low sheep population and the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are not enough sheep to sustain aggressive hunting.
