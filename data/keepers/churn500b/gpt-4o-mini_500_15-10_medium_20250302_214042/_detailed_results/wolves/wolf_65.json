            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.5% of its maximum capacity, and my previous theta of 0.16 indicates a focus on competition with other wolves. To allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population, I will gradually increase my hunting intensity to 0.25. This small adjustment helps balance the needs of both populations without risking a sudden depletion of sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow for recovery. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help ensure the sheep population stabilizes while also allowing the wolf population to adjust without overexerting our resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and my previous theta was already on the lower end. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for a modest increase in hunting intensity, which can help sustain my pack while still giving the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 5.77, which is only 0.6% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity and give the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, while also allowing the wolf population to stabilize without competing too aggressively with other wolves."
