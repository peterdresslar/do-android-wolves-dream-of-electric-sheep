            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.5% of its maximum capacity, which suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow for recovery. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while allowing the sheep population to stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that they need time to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and promotes long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 1.3% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a significant scarcity of prey. To allow the sheep to recover and avoid depleting their numbers further, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting intensely. This will help ensure a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 0.6% of its maximum capacity. Increasing hunting intensity could lead to a further decline in sheep numbers, jeopardizing the long-term survival of both species. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover, ensuring a sustainable balance."
