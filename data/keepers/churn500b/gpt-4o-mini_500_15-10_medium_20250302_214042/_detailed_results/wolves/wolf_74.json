            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 62.31, which is only 6.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, allowing for gradual recovery of the sheep while still supporting the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 36.22, which is only 3.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are under pressure and need time to recover. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to stabilize while still competing with other wolves. This moderate approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a balance for long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 2.1% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, it is crucial to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help stabilize the sheep population while also managing competition among wolves. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of adapting to changing conditions and avoiding sudden shifts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.31, which is only 1.3% of its maximum capacity. While I need to focus on hunting to ensure the survival of my pack, I must also be cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep and maintaining a balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 0.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their depletion. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing competition with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring that both populations can recover sustainably.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a significant imbalance. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than hunting sheep, I can allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the survival of my pack, I must also allow the sheep population to recover. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain my pack"
