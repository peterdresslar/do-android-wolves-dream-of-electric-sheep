            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.9% of maximum capacity, allowing for a gradual increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate approach will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while still enabling the sheep to recover. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, I must remain cautious and avoid overhunting, as the wolf population is still relatively small. This moderate adjustment will help maintain balance while ensuring both populations can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that they need time to recover. A lower theta allows me to focus on competing with other wolves, which can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to increase. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 94.88, which is only 9.5% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure my hunting supports wolf reproduction, I must also allow the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance, allowing for sustainable coexistence while being cautious not to deplete the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 2.1% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain balance and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and my previous theta was already on the lower end. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for a modest increase in hunting intensity to help sustain my pack while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance."
