            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.94, which is only 2.1% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.45 strikes a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting coexistence while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 1.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. By lowering my hunting intensity slightly, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still keeping an eye on the sheep population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 0.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help maintain a balance that supports both populations in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 4.25, which is just 0.4% of its maximum capacity. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover while also preventing overcompetition among wolves. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both populations."
