            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.5% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain our wolf population while still giving the sheep a chance to recover. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.18, which is only 0.9% of its maximum capacity. While I need to maintain some hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must also be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, enabling both populations to recover and coexist sustainably.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 0.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low at 0.09. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to bounce back, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species."
