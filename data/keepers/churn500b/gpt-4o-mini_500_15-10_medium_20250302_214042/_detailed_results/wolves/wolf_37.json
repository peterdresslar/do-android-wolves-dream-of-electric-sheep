            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.9% of maximum capacity, and my previous theta was quite low at 0.099. To allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a focus on competition with other wolves, a gradual increase to 0.25 will help balance the ecosystem without overwhelming the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term survival of both species. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance as the sheep population is recovering, while also considering the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.5% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 36.22, which is only 3.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to ensure our own survival. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while being mindful of the wolf population growth.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to replenish while also managing competition with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for sustainable coexistence."
