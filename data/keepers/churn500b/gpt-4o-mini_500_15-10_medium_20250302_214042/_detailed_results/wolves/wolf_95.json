            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I need to maintain some hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must also be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A moderate increase from my previous theta allows for sustainable coexistence while responding to the current low sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.94, which is only 2.1% of its maximum capacity. While my previous theta of 0.680 was effective for hunting, it is now crucial to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.40 strikes a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring both populations can stabilize and thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 1.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain a balance and prevent over-depletion of the sheep, which is crucial for our ecosystem",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.7% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low at 0.09. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while preventing overcompetition among wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 0.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that aggressive hunting could lead to a rapid decline in sheep numbers, jeopardizing the long-term survival of both species. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population a chance to recover. This balanced approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.4% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem.",
