            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 2.1% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.4% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a severe depletion of prey. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing competition with other wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 0.4% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. A moderate theta of 0.30 will help balance the need for wolf survival while giving sheep a chance to rebound, avoiding overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.4% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. This indicates that aggressive hunting could lead to the depletion of the sheep population, jeopardizing the long-term survival of both species. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a sustainable wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 0.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to replenish while also managing competition with other wolves. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both species."
