            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.5% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking their long-term survival. This adjustment will help us maintain a healthy wolf population while still being mindful of the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 62.31, which is only 6.2% of its maximum capacity. While my previous theta of 0.80 was focused on intense hunting, I need to reduce my hunting intensity slightly to allow the sheep population to recover. A theta of 0.70 strikes a balance between maintaining my hunting needs and ensuring the sustainability of the sheep population, which is crucial for the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 36.22, which is only 3.6% of its maximum capacity. While I need to maintain hunting to support wolf reproduction, I must also be cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. A moderate theta of 0.60 allows for some hunting while still considering the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable for hunting. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing competition with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem."
