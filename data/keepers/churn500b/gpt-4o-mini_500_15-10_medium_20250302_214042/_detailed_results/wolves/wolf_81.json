            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.5% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This balance will help sustain both the wolf and sheep populations while adapting to the current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 62.31, which is only 6.2% of its maximum capacity. While my previous theta of 0.650 was effective for a time, it is important to gradually reduce hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.55 strikes a balance between hunting and allowing the sheep population to stabilize, ensuring long-term sustainability for both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their extinction. By adopting a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to recover while maintaining a sustainable wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can allow the sheep population to stabilize and grow, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species."
