            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.5% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This value strikes a balance between ensuring the wolf population remains healthy while allowing the sheep to recover over time.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 62.31, which is only 6.2% of its maximum capacity. While my previous theta of 0.650 was effective for hunting, it may lead to further depletion of the sheep population. A moderate theta of 0.55 allows for a balanced approach, enabling me to hunt enough to sustain my pack while also giving the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.94, which is only 2.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also ensuring our wolf population remains stable. A moderate theta of 0.40 allows for some hunting to support our needs without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 9.18, which is only 0.9% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting intensely. This will help the sheep population bounce back while also stabilizing the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 5.77, which is only 0.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the sustainability of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",

To allow the sheep to recover and ensure long-term sustainability, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting sheep.
