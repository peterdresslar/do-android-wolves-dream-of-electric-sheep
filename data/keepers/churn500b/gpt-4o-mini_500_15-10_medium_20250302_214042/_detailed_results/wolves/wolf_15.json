            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.9% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This value supports a balanced approach, enabling the wolf population to thrive while still allowing sheep to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 62.31, which is only 6.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at only 3.6% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. This lower theta will help maintain a balance and prevent overhunting."
