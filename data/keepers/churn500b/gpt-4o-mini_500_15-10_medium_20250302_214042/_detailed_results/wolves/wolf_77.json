            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 62.31, which is only 6.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta value of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both populations, avoiding overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 2.1% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.31, which is only 1.3% of its maximum capacity. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover and grow, ensuring a sustainable food source for the future. Additionally, with a wolf population of 96, focusing on competition among wolves rather than aggressive hunting will help stabilize our numbers without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.7% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus more on competition with other wolves rather than hunting sheep. This will allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a sustainable wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow sheep to recover while still maintaining a presence in the ecosystem. A gradual adjustment will help stabilize the populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and ensures the long-term survival of both species."
