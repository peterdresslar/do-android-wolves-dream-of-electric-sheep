            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 41\n- Sheep population: 13.31\n- Wolf population: 96.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.476\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.14 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 1.3% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.31, which is only 1.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to gradually increase. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 0.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. By focusing on competition with other wolves instead of intense hunting, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while maintaining a healthy balance in the ecosystem."
