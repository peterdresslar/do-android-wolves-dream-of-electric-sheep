            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.94, which is only 2.1% of its maximum capacity. While I need to maintain hunting to support the wolf population, I must also be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will allow for some reproduction while still giving sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.18, which is only 0.9% of its maximum capacity. While I need to maintain a balance, a moderate increase in hunting intensity will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly. This approach allows for sustainable coexistence while being mindful of the current trends.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.7% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help ensure a sustainable balance in the ecosystem while allowing sheep to regain their numbers."
