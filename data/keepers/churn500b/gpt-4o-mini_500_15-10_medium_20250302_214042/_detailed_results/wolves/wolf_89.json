            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are more sheep per wolf. This suggests that focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting will allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a healthy balance in the wolf population. A gradual increase in theta is necessary to ensure long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 0.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover rather than intensifying our hunting. A moderate theta will help maintain a balance between our competition with other wolves and the need for sustainable sheep populations, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring that both populations can recover sustainably.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable for hunting. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing competition with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.4% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and my previous theta was focused on hunting. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to shift my focus towards competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to recover while maintaining a stable wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.4% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable for hunting. Maintaining a lower theta allows the sheep to recover while minimizing competition among wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.4% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to increase. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance."
