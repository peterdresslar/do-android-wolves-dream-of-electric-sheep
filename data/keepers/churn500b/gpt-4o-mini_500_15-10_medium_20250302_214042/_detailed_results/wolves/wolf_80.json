            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are more sheep available per wolf. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help sustain the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover gradually. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we are at risk of depleting their numbers further if we hunt too aggressively. A moderate approach will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling us to compete effectively with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to rebound.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.4% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable for hunting. Maintaining a lower theta allows the sheep to recover while preventing over-competition among wolves. This balance is crucial for ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.4% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while also preventing overcompetition among wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and ensures the long-term survival of both species."
