            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level (15.9% of maximum capacity), allowing for a more aggressive hunting strategy to increase our wolf population. However, I want to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly, so I am making a moderate adjustment rather than a drastic one.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is necessary to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly, and this theta reflects a balanced approach to both hunting and competition.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I need to maintain a balance for the wolf population, I also want to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.50 will enable me to hunt enough to sustain my pack while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the wolf population is relatively high. A lower theta allows for competition among wolves, which can help stabilize our numbers while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem."
