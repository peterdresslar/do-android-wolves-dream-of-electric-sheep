            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 38\n- Sheep population: 62.31\n- Wolf population: 100.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.220\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.62 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 6.2% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 62.31, which is only 6.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves and allow the sheep population to gradually increase, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their depletion. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining our own numbers. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 4.10, which is only 0.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while also addressing the current imbalance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.4% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, ensuring a more sustainable balance in the ecosystem."
