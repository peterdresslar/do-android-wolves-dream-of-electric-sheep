            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for increased hunting intensity without risking depletion. However, given the wolf population is also significant, a moderate increase in hunting will help sustain both populations while avoiding sudden changes that could disrupt the balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level (12.5% of maximum capacity), allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking immediate depletion. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sustainable coexistence as the sheep population recovers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 94.88, which is only 9.5% of its maximum capacity. While I want to maintain a balance, I can afford to keep my hunting intensity moderate to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. This allows for a sustainable approach while still considering the current conditions.",
