            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 94.88, which is only 9.5% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to help sustain wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A moderate adjustment will help maintain balance as both populations evolve.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 62.31, which is only 6.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.4 to 0.35 reflects a balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.3% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. To allow the sheep to recover and prevent overhunting, I will focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensifying hunting. This will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.9% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep to recover. A gradual decrease in theta will help maintain a balance and prevent a crash in the ecosystem."
