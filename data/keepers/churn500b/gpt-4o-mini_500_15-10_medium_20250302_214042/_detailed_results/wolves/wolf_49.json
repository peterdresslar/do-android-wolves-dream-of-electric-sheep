            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.94, which is only 2.1% of its maximum capacity. While I need to maintain a healthy wolf population, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.31, which is only 1.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.450 to 0.35, I can focus more on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, thus promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 9.18, which is only 0.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are under significant pressure, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to their further decline. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to recover while ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a bit more hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance."
