A moderate theta of 0.30 strikes a balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep, promoting sustainable coexistence.",

This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can recover over time.",

This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual increase aligns with the wisdom of adapting to changing conditions.",

This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A gradual approach is essential to maintain balance.",
