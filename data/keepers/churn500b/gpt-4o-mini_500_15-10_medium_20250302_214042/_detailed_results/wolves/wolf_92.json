            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 36.22, which is only 3.6% of its maximum capacity. While my previous theta of 0.676 indicates a focus on hunting, it is important to adjust to a more balanced approach to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.58 reflects a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while giving sheep a chance to increase their numbers, ensuring long-term sustainability for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.94, which is only 2.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.40 allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By focusing more on competition with other wolves and reducing hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to stabilize and grow, ensuring a sustainable ecosystem for the future.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and my previous theta was already on the lower end. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for a modest increase in hunting intensity, which can help support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance."
