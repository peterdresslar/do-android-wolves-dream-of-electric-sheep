A small increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.32, which is only 2.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that the sheep need time to recover, and a lower hunting intensity will allow for their population to stabilize.

A moderate increase to 0.45 reflects a balanced approach, enabling us to sustain our wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover gradually.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.9% of maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are more sheep available for hunting. However, with only 4 wolves, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure the sheep can recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance while allowing for gradual population growth in both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.8% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can recover over time.",
