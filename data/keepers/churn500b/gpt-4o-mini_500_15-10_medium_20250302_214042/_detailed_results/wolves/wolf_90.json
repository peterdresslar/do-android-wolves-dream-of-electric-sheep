            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.5% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 36.22, which is only 3.6% of its maximum capacity. While my previous theta of 0.650 allowed for some hunting, it is now crucial to shift towards a more balanced approach to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.40 reflects a moderate hunting intensity that will help sustain both populations without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 2.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. With a high wolf population, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.3% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable for sustainable hunting. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing competition with other wolves. This gradual adjustment helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for sheep recovery. A moderate approach will help maintain balance and ensure the long-term survival of both species."
