            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.5% of its maximum capacity, and my previous theta was quite low at 0.116. To allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a focus on competition with other wolves, a gradual increase to 0.25 strikes a balance that supports both populations without risking overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are more sheep available per wolf. This suggests that I can afford to maintain a moderate hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover while also ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. Gradually increasing my hunting intensity will help balance the ecosystem without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.31, which is only 1.3% of its maximum capacity. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover while also keeping the wolf population stable. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.14, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help allow the sheep to rebound while maintaining a stable wolf population. This gradual adjustment will support long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and my previous theta was already on the lower end. By maintaining a moderate hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition with other wolves. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both populations."
