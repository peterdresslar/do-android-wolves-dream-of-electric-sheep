            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This approach balances the need for wolf reproduction while ensuring that the sheep population can recover and thrive. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio, a slight increase in theta will help maintain a dynamic equilibrium without risking a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for moderate hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. This approach balances the need for wolf reproduction while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. It also allows us to remain competitive with other wolves without risking overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 14.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. By adopting a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves, which will help stabilize our population while allowing the sheep to recover. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual increase is necessary to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring a balance that supports both species in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 62.31, which is only 6.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help balance the ecosystem without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.94, which is only 2.1% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity and give the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, creating a more sustainable balance."
