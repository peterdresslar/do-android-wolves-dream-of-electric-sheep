            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 1\n- Sheep population: 15.77\n- Wolf population: 10.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.500\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 1.58 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 1.6% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.77, which is only 1.6% of its maximum capacity. While I want to ensure the wolves can reproduce, I must also allow the sheep population to recover. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.63, which is only 1.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable, and I need to prioritize their recovery while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, reducing hunting intensity to support the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a more balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting."
