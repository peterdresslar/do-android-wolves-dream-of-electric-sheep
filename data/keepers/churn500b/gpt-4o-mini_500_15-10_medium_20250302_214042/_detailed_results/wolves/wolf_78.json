            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.94, which is only 2.1% of its maximum capacity. While I need to maintain a healthy wolf population, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A moderate hunting intensity will help sustain both populations without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to repopulate while also managing the competition with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. This lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and my previous theta was focused on hunting. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to shift my focus towards reducing hunting intensity. This will allow the sheep population to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population."
