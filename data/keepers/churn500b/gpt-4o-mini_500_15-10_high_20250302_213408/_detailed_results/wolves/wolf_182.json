            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we manage our own numbers more sustainably. This cautious approach aligns with the need to ensure long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance in the ecosystem without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. It is crucial to focus on competition with other wolves to allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both species while avoiding overhunting."
