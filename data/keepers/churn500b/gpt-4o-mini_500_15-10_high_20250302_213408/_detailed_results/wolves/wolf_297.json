This cautious approach will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while still competing with other wolves for resources. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
