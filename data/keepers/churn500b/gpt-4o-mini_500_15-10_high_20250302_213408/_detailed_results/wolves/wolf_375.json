            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while there are many sheep per wolf, I need to prioritize the long-term survival of both species. A moderate hunting intensity allows for some growth in the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while still competing with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a balance and ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competition among wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and I need to prioritize their recovery while still considering the competition among wolves. A lower theta allows for a focus on coexistence and gives sheep a chance to rebound, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 3.3% of its maximum capacity, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent further depletion of the sheep."
