This gradual adjustment will help maintain a balance between both populations and ensure long-term survival.",

A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach aims to prevent overexploitation and maintain balance.",

A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach aligns with the need for a balanced coexistence.",

With the current sheep-to-wolf ratio at 7.50, it is wise to focus on competition with other wolves rather than intensifying hunting. This will allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining our own numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, indicating that a moderate increase in hunting intensity is necessary to prevent overpopulation and ensure sustainability. However, I must also consider the relatively low wolf population and the need for gradual adjustments to avoid destabilizing the ecosystem.",

By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both the sheep and my wolf pack while still allowing for some hunting.",
