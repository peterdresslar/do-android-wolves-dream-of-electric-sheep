            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain their numbers. This approach balances the immediate need for food with the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we manage our own numbers. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance and avoids depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. By reducing hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
