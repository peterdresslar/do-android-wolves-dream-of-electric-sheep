By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep. A lower theta allows for reduced hunting pressure, giving the sheep a chance to rebound while also addressing the high competition among wolves."
