By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while ensuring the sheep have a chance to rebound, thus promoting long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is relatively high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while reducing the pressure on our own population. This cautious approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence and avoids depleting the sheep further.",
