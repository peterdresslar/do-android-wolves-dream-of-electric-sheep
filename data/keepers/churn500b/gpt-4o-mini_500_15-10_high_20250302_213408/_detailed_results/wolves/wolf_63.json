            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. By maintaining a moderate hunting intensity, I can help ensure the sheep have a chance to recover while also managing competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. By reducing hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we manage our numbers more sustainably. This cautious approach aligns with the need for balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition among wolves. The sheep population is low, and hunting intensity needs to be moderated to allow for recovery. A gradual increase in theta is necessary to ensure sustainable coexistence while being cautious not to deplete the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. This cautious approach will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem."
