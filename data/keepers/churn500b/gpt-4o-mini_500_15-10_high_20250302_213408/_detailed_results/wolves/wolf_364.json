            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also addressing the moderately high wolf population. This cautious approach aims to ensure the long-term survival of both species and maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover. A gradual decrease in theta will help maintain a balance while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted to help sustain the wolf population, but I must remain cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. This gradual adjustment allows for recovery while still considering the long-term balance.",
