A moderate increase in hunting intensity will allow for some growth in the wolf population while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep further. This balance will help ensure long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep while still competing with other wolves.",

By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while maintaining a healthy balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep to recover while ensuring the wolf population remains stable. This gradual adjustment helps maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",

This approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species and prevents a potential crash in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and with the wolf population being moderately high, it is crucial to focus on reducing competition among wolves rather than intensifying hunting. This will allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a sustainable wolf population.",

A moderate theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting, giving sheep a chance to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. This balance is crucial for long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is relatively high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while reducing pressure on the wolf population, ensuring long-term sustainability."
