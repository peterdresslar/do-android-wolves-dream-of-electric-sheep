A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our own numbers. This cautious approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence.",

A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure on the sheep, allowing their numbers to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This gradual adjustment aligns with the need for balance in the ecosystem.",
