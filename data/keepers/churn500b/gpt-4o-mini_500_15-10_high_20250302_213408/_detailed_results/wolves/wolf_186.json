A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure on the sheep, allowing them to recover while also managing competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is quite low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that competition among wolves is increasing. By focusing on lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while managing the wolf population sustainably. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is moderately high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while also preventing overcompetition among wolves. A gradual decrease in theta will help maintain balance without causing sudden population crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance in the ecosystem without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and a cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. With the current sheep-to-wolf ratio becoming less favorable, focusing on competition with other wolves will help stabilize the wolf population while giving sheep a chance to rebound.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This adjustment helps maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help the sheep recover while still allowing for some competition among wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims to ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution in hunting. While the wolf population is also low, a gradual approach allows for recovery of both species. This moderate theta will help maintain a balance, ensuring the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while I want to allow for some hunting to support wolf reproduction, I must prioritize the sustainability of the sheep population. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves."
