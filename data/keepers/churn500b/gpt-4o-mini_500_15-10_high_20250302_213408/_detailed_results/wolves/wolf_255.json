            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, and while the wolf population is low, it presents an opportunity for growth. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help manage the sheep population while allowing for sustainable coexistence. This adjustment is gradual, aligning with the wisdom of maintaining balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while there are many sheep per wolf, we need to be cautious to avoid depleting their numbers too quickly. A moderate hunting intensity allows for some growth in the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that we need to prioritize their recovery to ensure long-term sustainability. A moderate hunting intensity will allow us to compete with other wolves while giving sheep a chance to rebound.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. While the wolf population is moderately high, I want to avoid overhunting and ensure the long-term survival of both species. A gradual decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a sustainable balance."
