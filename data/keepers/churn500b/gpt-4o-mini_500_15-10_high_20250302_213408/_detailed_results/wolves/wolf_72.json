            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for a balanced approach. A moderate theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while also giving sheep a chance to recover. This strategy aims to prevent overexploitation of the sheep and maintain a sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is quite low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. By focusing on reducing hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This approach aligns with the need for a balanced ecosystem and avoids the risk of depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution in hunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the long-term survival of both species."
