            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure on the sheep, allowing them to recover while we manage competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need to focus on reducing competition among wolves rather than intensifying hunting. This will allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is quite low at 2.5% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. A gradual increase from my previous theta will help maintain balance without causing sudden shifts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and with the wolf population being high, it is essential to focus on reducing competition among wolves rather than intensifying hunting. This will allow the sheep to recover and maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This helps ensure the long-term survival of both species without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. A gradual decrease in theta will help stabilize the ecosystem without causing sudden shifts."
