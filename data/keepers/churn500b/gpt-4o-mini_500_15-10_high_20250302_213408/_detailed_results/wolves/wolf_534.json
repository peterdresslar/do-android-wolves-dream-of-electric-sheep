            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution in hunting. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain our population while allowing the sheep to recover. This adjustment aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for a balanced approach. A moderate theta allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some hunting to support wolf reproduction. This adjustment helps prevent further depletion of the sheep population while managing competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating that competition among wolves is increasing. A lower theta allows for reduced hunting intensity, giving the sheep a chance to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This approach aligns with the need for long-term balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the current wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This gradual adjustment will help maintain balance in the ecosystem and prevent a crash."
