            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is quite low at 4.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution in hunting. With a high wolf population, competition is increasing, and a lower theta allows for a focus on reducing competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we manage our numbers more sustainably.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need to prioritize competition among wolves to allow the sheep to recover. A gradual increase in theta will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem without depleting the sheep further."
