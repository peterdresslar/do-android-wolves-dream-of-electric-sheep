By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to stabilize, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This gradual adjustment will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. By reducing hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while managing competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is quite low at 2.9% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting to maintain wolf health. This gradual adjustment helps ensure the long-term survival of both species."
