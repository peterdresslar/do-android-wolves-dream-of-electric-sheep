            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need to focus on reducing competition among wolves while allowing the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help maintain balance and prevent overhunting, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 3.0% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure on the sheep, allowing them to recover while we manage our own numbers more sustainably.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is moderately high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity slightly to allow the sheep to recover while still competing with other wolves. This small adjustment helps maintain balance without risking a crash in either population."
