This approach allows for some hunting while prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta allows the sheep to recover while also reducing the pressure on the wolf population. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",

A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This cautious approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. A gradual decrease in theta will help stabilize the ecosystem without causing sudden changes that could lead to crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution. With the sheep-to-wolf ratio becoming less favorable, it is important to focus on competition among wolves rather than intensifying hunting.
