            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is concerningly low, and with a high wolf population, competition is likely increasing. By focusing on reducing hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is quite low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure on the sheep, allowing them to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This gradual adjustment aligns with the need for balance and long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This approach supports long-term sustainability and avoids depleting the sheep further."
