            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. A lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover while we focus on competition among wolves, ensuring our long-term survival and preventing a crash in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A lower theta allows for more focus on competing with other wolves, which may help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment is crucial to ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",

While the wolf population is low and could support a slight increase in hunting intensity, I want to avoid depleting the sheep further. A gradual increase in theta will help maintain a balance while still allowing for some growth in the wolf population.",

A moderate increase allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling the wolf population to grow.",
