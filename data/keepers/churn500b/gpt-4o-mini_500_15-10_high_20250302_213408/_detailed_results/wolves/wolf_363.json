            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while giving sheep a chance to recover, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and with the wolf population being high, it is essential to focus on reducing competition among wolves. This will allow the sheep to recover and stabilize, ensuring the long-term survival of both species. A gradual decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain balance without causing sudden disruptions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This approach aligns with the need for caution in our current ecosystem state.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This cautious approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. It is crucial to prioritize the recovery of the sheep population to ensure long-term sustainability. By focusing more on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help the sheep recover while maintaining a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting, which can help maintain the sheep population while still enabling some reproduction among wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence.",
