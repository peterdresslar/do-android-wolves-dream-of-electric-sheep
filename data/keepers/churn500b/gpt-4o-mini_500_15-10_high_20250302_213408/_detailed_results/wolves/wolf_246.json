            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This cautious approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need for sustainable coexistence, it is essential to prioritize the long-term survival of both species over immediate gains.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance without risking a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution in hunting. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both species."
