This balance helps prevent over-depletion of sheep and promotes sustainable coexistence.",

A moderate approach will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain its health. This gradual adjustment helps avoid overexploitation of the sheep and supports long-term sustainability."
