However, I must remain cautious as the sheep numbers are concerning, and the wolf population is low, suggesting a need for balance. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help support wolf reproduction while allowing for sustainable coexistence.",

A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity, allowing the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
