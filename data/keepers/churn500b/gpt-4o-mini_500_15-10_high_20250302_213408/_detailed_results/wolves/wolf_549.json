A slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted to support reproduction, but I must remain cautious to avoid further depletion of the sheep. This adjustment allows for a gradual response to the current ecosystem state while prioritizing long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to recover. With the sheep-to-wolf ratio becoming less favorable, it is essential to focus on competition among wolves rather than depleting the sheep further. This cautious approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting, which helps maintain the sheep population while still enabling some reproduction among wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. By reducing my hunting intensity further, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing the competition among wolves. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
