            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and the wolf population is relatively high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta allows the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting to sustain the wolf population. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance and prevents overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a sustainable wolf population. This gradual adjustment helps prevent overhunting and supports long-term balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance and prevents overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can help ensure that the sheep population has a chance to rebound, which will ultimately support the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep."
