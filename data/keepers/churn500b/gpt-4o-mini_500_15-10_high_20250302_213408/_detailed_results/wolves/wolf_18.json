            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that a more cautious approach is needed. By adopting a moderate hunting intensity, I can help ensure the sheep have the opportunity to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. This balance allows for sustainable coexistence and prevents potential crashes in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that we need to prioritize their recovery to ensure long-term sustainability. By focusing more on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, we can allow the sheep to regain their numbers while maintaining our own population health.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem. This gradual adjustment will help prevent a crash in sheep numbers and ensure long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. By reducing hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while managing competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution in hunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population, ensuring long-term balance."
