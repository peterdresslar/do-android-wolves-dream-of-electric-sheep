            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling us to maintain our numbers. This approach balances our immediate needs with the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow sheep to recover while preventing overhunting, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is quite low at 23.01, which is only 2.3% of its maximum capacity. With a high wolf population of 52, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable at 0.44 sheep per wolf. To ensure the long-term survival of both species and allow the sheep to recover, I need to focus more on reducing competition among wolves and give the sheep a chance to increase their numbers. A lower theta will help achieve this balance."
