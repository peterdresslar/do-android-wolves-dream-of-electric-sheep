A moderate theta allows for some hunting while prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population, ensuring long-term balance.",

By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. This gradual adjustment will help maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. It is crucial to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while minimizing competition among wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and ensure long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance in the ecosystem without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution in hunting. A moderate theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while also giving sheep a chance to recover. This balance is crucial for the long-term survival of both species.",

A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that supports wolf population growth while giving sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while the wolf population is also low, it is important to prioritize the recovery of the sheep. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to stabilize and grow, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
