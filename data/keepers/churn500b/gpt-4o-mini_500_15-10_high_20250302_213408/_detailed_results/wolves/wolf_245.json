This cautious approach will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem without risking a crash.",

This adjustment aims to ensure the long-term survival of both species without risking a crash.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A gradual reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain its health. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
