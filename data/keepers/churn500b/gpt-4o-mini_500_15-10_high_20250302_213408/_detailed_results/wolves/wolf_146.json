            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and a more cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both sheep and wolves while still competing effectively with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is relatively high, leading to increased competition among wolves. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing the competition within the wolf pack. This approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence and avoids depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow sheep to recover while we manage our numbers more sustainably. This cautious approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low at only 4.0% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. This suggests that increased competition among wolves could lead to a decline in our numbers if we continue to hunt aggressively. By adopting a lower theta, I can focus on reducing competition and allowing the sheep population to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species."
