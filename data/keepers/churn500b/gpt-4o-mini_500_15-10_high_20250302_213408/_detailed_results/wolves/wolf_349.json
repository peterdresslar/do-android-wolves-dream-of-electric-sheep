A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity, allowing the sheep to recover while also addressing the competition among wolves. This approach aligns with the goal of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",

By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
