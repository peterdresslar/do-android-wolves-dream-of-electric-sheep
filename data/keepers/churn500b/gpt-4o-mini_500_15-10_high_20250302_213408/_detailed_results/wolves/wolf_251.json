            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 243\n- Sheep population: 104.49\n- Wolf population: 41.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.250\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 2.55 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 10.4% of maximum capacity\n\nEcosystem observations:\n- The wolf population is quite high, which may lead to increased competition.\n- Sheep numbers are becoming concerning, suggesting caution may be needed.\n- The ratio of sheep to wolves is becoming less favorable, which may require adaptation.\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a healthy balance within the wolf pack. This gradual adjustment will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while preventing overexploitation, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This cautious approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 2.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution. With the sheep-to-wolf ratio becoming less favorable, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating that a cautious approach is necessary to allow for recovery. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from the previous theta, I can still focus on competition with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution in hunting. A moderate approach allows for some hunting while still enabling sheep recovery, which is essential for long-term balance. This adjustment also considers the current low wolf population, allowing for potential growth without overexploiting the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating a need for caution in hunting. While the wolf population is low and could benefit from some increased hunting, I must prioritize the long-term survival of both species. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still promoting sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and I need to prioritize their recovery while also considering the current low wolf population. A lower theta will allow for competition among wolves to stabilize our numbers, ensuring that we do not overhunt the sheep and risk a population crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating that a more cautious approach is needed to allow their numbers to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from the previous theta, I can still support wolf population growth while being mindful of the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow for recovery. With the wolf population being relatively low, focusing on competition rather than intense hunting will help maintain balance and ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating a need for caution in hunting. However, the wolf population is also low, suggesting that a moderate increase in hunting intensity could help support our growth without depleting the sheep too quickly. A theta of 0.45 allows for a balanced approach that promotes coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating a need for caution in hunting. However, the wolf population is also low, and there are many sheep per wolf, suggesting that a moderate increase in hunting intensity could support wolf growth while still allowing for sheep recovery. This balance aims for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively low at 4.7% of maximum capacity, and there are many sheep per wolf, indicating that the ecosystem can support more hunting. However, I want to ensure that I do not deplete the sheep population too quickly, so I will increase my hunting intensity moderately to maintain a balance.",

While the wolf population is low and can support some increase in hunting, a moderate approach will help maintain balance and allow for sheep recovery. This theta reflects a sustainable coexistence strategy.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the wolf population, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still being cautious about the sheep numbers, which are concerning. A moderate increase in theta allows for sustainable hunting without risking a drastic decline in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that while we can still hunt, we need to be cautious to avoid depleting their numbers further. A moderate increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support our growth while still prioritizing the sustainability of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently high, allowing for increased hunting intensity without immediate risk of depletion. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of nearly 10:1, there is room for sustainable hunting that can support wolf reproduction while still being mindful of the sheep population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating a need for caution in hunting. While the wolf population is low and can support some increase in hunting, a moderate approach allows for sustainable coexistence and gives sheep a chance to recover. This balance helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",

While there are many sheep per wolf, the current state suggests that a more moderate approach is necessary to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. This adjustment will help ensure long-term sustainability.",
