            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution in hunting. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, enabling sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. This adjustment helps avoid overexploitation of the sheep and promotes sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This gradual adjustment helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This cautious approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution. While the wolf population is also low, increasing hunting intensity too quickly could lead to a depletion of sheep, which is not sustainable. A moderate approach allows for some hunting while still giving sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution in hunting. While the wolf population is also low, a gradual increase in hunting intensity allows for some growth while still giving sheep a chance to recover.
