This gradual adjustment aligns with the need for balance in the ecosystem.",

A lower theta will allow sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This gradual adjustment helps ensure long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and a cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to rebound.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating that we need to prioritize their recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring that both populations can stabilize without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating a need for caution in hunting. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while still competing with other wolves. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",

A moderate increase allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling the wolf population to grow.",

A moderate increase in hunting intensity allows for potential growth in the wolf population while still considering the sustainability of the sheep. This adjustment aligns with the current ecosystem state and trends.",

This adjustment supports the growth of the wolf population while still being mindful of the need for balance.",
