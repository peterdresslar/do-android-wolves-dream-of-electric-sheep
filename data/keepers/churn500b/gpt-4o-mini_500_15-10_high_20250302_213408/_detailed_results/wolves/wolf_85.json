            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that while we can increase our hunting intensity to support our reproduction, we must do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A theta of 0.7 allows for increased hunting while still considering the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that a more cautious approach is needed to allow their numbers to recover. A moderate theta value will help maintain a balance between hunting and ensuring the sustainability of both sheep and wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is concerningly low, and with a high wolf population, competition is likely increasing. A moderate theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting while still enabling the sheep to recover, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure on the sheep, allowing their numbers to recover while still maintaining some hunting for our needs. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of sustaining both populations."
