A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain itself. This approach helps to ensure long-term sustainability for both species.",

By focusing on reducing hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments to ensure long-term survival for both species.",

By reducing hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while managing competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
