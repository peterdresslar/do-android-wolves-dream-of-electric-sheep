            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution in hunting. A moderate theta allows for some hunting to support reproduction while also giving sheep a chance to recover, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow sheep to recover while preventing overhunting, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, which suggests that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help stabilize the ecosystem and ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A lower theta allows for more focus on competition with other wolves, which will help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating that a cautious approach is necessary to allow for recovery. While the wolf population is low, increasing hunting intensity too quickly could lead to a depletion of sheep, which would harm both species in the long run. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of the ecosystem."
