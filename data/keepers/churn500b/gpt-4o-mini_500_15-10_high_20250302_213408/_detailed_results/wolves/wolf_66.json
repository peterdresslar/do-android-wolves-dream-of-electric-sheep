A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we manage our own numbers more sustainably. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",

A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This cautious approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",

A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population.
