            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for a balanced approach. A moderate theta allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some hunting to support wolf reproduction. This adjustment helps prevent over-depletion of sheep and maintains a healthier ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain their numbers. This approach supports long-term sustainability and avoids depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a healthy balance within our wolf pack. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments to ensure long-term survival for both species."
