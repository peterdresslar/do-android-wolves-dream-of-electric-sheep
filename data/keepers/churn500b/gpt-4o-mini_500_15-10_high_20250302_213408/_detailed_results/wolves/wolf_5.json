A moderate hunting intensity allows for some growth in the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to stabilize and recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",

This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
