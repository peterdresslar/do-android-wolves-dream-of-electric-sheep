A moderate theta allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some hunting to support wolf reproduction. This adjustment helps prevent further depletion of the sheep population while addressing competition among wolves.",

To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. It is crucial to prioritize the recovery of the sheep population to ensure long-term sustainability. A lower theta will allow for more competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to rebound.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted to support wolf reproduction, but I must remain cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. This gradual adjustment allows for a more sustainable balance.",
