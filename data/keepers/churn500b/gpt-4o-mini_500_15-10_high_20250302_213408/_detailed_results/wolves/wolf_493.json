To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to prioritize caution and allow the sheep population to recover while competing with other wolves. A gradual reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A cautious approach is necessary to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining some hunting intensity to support the wolf population. This gradual adjustment helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. A gradual decrease in theta will help maintain a balance while avoiding sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem."
