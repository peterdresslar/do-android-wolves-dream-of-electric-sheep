To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help create a more sustainable balance.",

A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our own numbers. This cautious approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species."
