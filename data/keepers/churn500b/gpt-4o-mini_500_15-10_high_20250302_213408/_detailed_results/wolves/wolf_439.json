A theta of 0.60 allows for a balanced approach that supports wolf reproduction while still being mindful of the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that while I can still hunt, I need to be cautious to avoid depleting their numbers further. A moderate approach allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some growth in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, and while the wolf population is low, I want to increase hunting intensity to ensure our growth without depleting the sheep too quickly. A moderate increase allows for sustainable coexistence while still addressing the current imbalance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and there are many sheep per wolf, indicating that we can increase our hunting intensity without jeopardizing the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while there are many sheep per wolf, I need to balance hunting with the need for sheep to recover. A moderate theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep population can stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating a need for cautious hunting to prevent depletion. However, with a relatively low wolf population and a high sheep-to-wolf ratio, a moderate increase in hunting intensity can help sustain our numbers while allowing the sheep population to recover. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of gradual changes to maintain balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, indicating that while we can increase our hunting intensity, we must do so cautiously to avoid depleting their numbers too quickly. A moderate approach allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling our pack to grow.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, and while my wolf pack is small, we can afford to increase our hunting intensity slightly. A theta of 0.55 allows for a balanced approach that supports our growth while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too rapidly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and there are many sheep per wolf, indicating that we can increase our hunting intensity without immediately threatening the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while there are many sheep per wolf, we need to prioritize the long-term survival of both species. A moderate hunting intensity allows for some hunting while giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that a more cautious approach is needed to allow their numbers to recover. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while maintaining a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that we need to prioritize their recovery. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, we can allow the sheep to stabilize and gradually increase their numbers, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to recover. With the current sheep-to-wolf ratio at 5.00, it"
