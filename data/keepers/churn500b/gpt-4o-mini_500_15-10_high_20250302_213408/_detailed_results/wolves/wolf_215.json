            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while my previous theta allowed for some hunting, it is now crucial to adopt a more balanced approach. A moderate theta will help maintain the sheep population while still allowing for some hunting to support the wolf population. This adjustment aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and with the wolf population being relatively high, it is prudent to focus on reducing competition among wolves. This will allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. By focusing on lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This cautious approach aligns with the need to maintain a balance in the ecosystem."
