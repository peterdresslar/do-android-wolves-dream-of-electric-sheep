            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting to maintain our population. This gradual adjustment helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 2.1% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while managing competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the need for caution in the current ecosystem state.",
