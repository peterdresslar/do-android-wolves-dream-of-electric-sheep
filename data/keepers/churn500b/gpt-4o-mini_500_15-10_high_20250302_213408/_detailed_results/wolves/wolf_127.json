            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need to focus on competition among wolves rather than hunting sheep. This will allow the sheep to recover while maintaining our numbers in a sustainable manner.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This approach aligns with the need for a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep population while being cautious with the wolf population, which is moderately high. A lower theta allows for competition among wolves and gives sheep a chance to recover without depleting their numbers further."
