            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and with a wolf population that is moderately high, it is prudent to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover. A gradual adjustment helps maintain balance and avoids drastic impacts on either population.",

A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while also helping to stabilize the wolf population. This cautious approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence.",

A lower theta will allow sheep to recover while we manage our numbers more sustainably. This cautious approach aligns with the need to ensure long-term survival for both species."
