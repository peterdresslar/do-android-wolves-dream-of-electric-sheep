            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while I need to maintain a healthy wolf population, I must prioritize the recovery of the sheep. A moderate hunting intensity allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species and maintains a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low at only 11.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their depletion. With a moderately high wolf population, it is wise to focus on competition among wolves to allow the sheep to recover. A gradual reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while preventing overexploitation, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance and avoids overexploitation of the sheep."
