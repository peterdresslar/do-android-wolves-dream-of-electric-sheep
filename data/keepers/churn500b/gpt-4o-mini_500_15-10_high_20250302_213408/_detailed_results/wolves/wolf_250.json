This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance in the ecosystem.",

To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus more on competition with other wolves rather than hunting sheep. This will allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. A gradual decrease in theta will help maintain a balance while avoiding sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",

To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent further depletion of the sheep population.",
