            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta value will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition, supporting both populations in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling wolves to sustain their numbers. This approach balances the immediate need for food with the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain itself. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments to ensure a sustainable balance."
