            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and with a high wolf population, we need to be cautious about overhunting. A moderate theta allows for some hunting to support reproduction while also giving sheep a chance to recover. This balance is crucial for the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to thrive. This approach balances the immediate need for food with the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep. A lower theta will allow us to focus on competition among wolves, which will help stabilize our population while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance."
