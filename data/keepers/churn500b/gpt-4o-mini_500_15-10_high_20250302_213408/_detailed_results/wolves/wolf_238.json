            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is quite low at only 4.5% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. This suggests that we need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both species by preventing overhunting and promoting a more sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity, I can help sustain the wolf population while allowing sheep numbers to recover. This gradual adjustment will help maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. A gradual decrease in theta will help stabilize the ecosystem without causing drastic changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This helps ensure the long-term survival of both species."
