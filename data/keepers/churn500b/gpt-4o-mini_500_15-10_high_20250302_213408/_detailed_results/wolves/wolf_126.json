            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while reducing the pressure on the wolf population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is quite low at 17.20, which is only 1.7% of its maximum capacity. With a high wolf population of 44.00, the competition among wolves is increasing. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover while managing the wolf population sustainably.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep. By reducing hunting intensity, I can help ensure that the sheep population has a chance to rebound, which is essential for the long-term survival of both species. This cautious approach allows us to adapt to the current conditions without risking a crash in the ecosystem."
