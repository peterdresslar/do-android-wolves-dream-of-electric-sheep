            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while my previous theta allowed for some hunting, it is now crucial to adopt a more balanced approach. A moderate theta of 0.5 will help maintain the sheep population while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and with a high wolf population, competition is increasing. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to sustain itself. This approach balances the immediate need for food with the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity, allowing the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem."
