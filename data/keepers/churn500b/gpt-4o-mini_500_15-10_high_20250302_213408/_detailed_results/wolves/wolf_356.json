            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A moderate hunting intensity allows for some sheep recovery while still enabling wolves to thrive. This balance is crucial for the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while reducing competition among wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 2.0% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while reducing pressure on the wolf population, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being cautious about the wolf population. A lower theta will help maintain balance and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. It is essential to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover and maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem. A gradual decrease in hunting will help ensure the long-term survival of both species."
