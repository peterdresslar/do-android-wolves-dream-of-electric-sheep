            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is concerningly low, and with a high wolf population, competition is likely to increase. A lower theta allows for a focus on reducing competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover. This approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence and avoids depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while preventing overexploitation. This approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence and avoids sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition among wolves. The sheep population is low and concerning, so I need to prioritize their recovery while still allowing for some hunting. A lower theta will help ensure the sheep can rebound, which is crucial for the long-term survival of both species."
