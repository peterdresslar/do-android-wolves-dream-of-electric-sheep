            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that a more cautious approach is needed to allow for recovery. A moderate theta of 0.5 strikes a balance between hunting and competing with other wolves, promoting sustainability while still allowing for some hunting to support our population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. By reducing hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep while maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition among wolves. The sheep population is concerningly low, and a lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance and avoids depleting the sheep further."
