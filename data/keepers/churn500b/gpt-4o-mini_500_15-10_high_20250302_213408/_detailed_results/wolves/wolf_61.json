            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for a balanced approach. A moderate theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while giving sheep a chance to recover. This strategy aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. A lower theta allows for reduced hunting intensity, giving the sheep a chance to recover while also addressing the competition among wolves. This approach aligns with the goal of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable for sustainable hunting. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while managing the competition among wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem."
