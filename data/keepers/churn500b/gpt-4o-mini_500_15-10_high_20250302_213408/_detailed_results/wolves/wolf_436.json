            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while reducing pressure on their numbers, ensuring a more sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This cautious approach ensures the long-term survival of both species and prevents further depletion of the sheep population.",

A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This cautious approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",

While the wolf population is relatively low, I need to prioritize the long-term sustainability of both species. A moderate theta will help maintain a balance, allowing for some hunting while also considering the need for sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution in hunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some growth in the wolf population while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep. This balanced approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, indicating a need for caution in hunting to allow their numbers to recover. However, with a relatively low wolf population, a slight increase in hunting intensity can help support our growth without risking a crash in the sheep population. This moderate adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution. With the wolf population also relatively low, it is wise to focus on competing with other wolves to allow the sheep to recover. This approach will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem and ensure the long-term survival of both species."
