            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, and while I want to ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I also recognize the opportunity for growth in the wolf population. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for more sustainable hunting while still addressing the sheep overpopulation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, and while I want to increase hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A moderate approach allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some growth in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both sheep and wolves, while still allowing for some competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while also addressing the competition among wolves. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem."
