By focusing more on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while avoiding further depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and a cautious approach is needed to allow their numbers to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to stabilize. This aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while reducing pressure on our own population. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance and ensures the long-term survival of both species."
