            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a sustainable wolf population. This gradual adjustment helps avoid drastic changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. It is crucial to prioritize the recovery of the sheep population to ensure long-term sustainability. A lower theta allows for competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to rebound.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while I want to allow for some hunting to support our wolf population, I must prioritize the recovery of the sheep. A gradual increase from my previous theta will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution in hunting. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also considering the current low wolf population, which may benefit from a more competitive approach. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution. A lower theta allows for competition among wolves, which can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This approach aligns with the goal of ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution. While the wolf population is also low, a gradual increase in hunting intensity is warranted to allow for some growth in the wolf population without depleting the sheep further. This moderate approach helps maintain balance and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating that a cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta will enable some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while maintaining a healthy balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while there are many sheep per wolf, I need to balance hunting with the potential for wolf population growth. A moderate increase in hunting intensity allows for sustainable coexistence while still being cautious about the sheep numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that while I can increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate increase to 0.55 allows for some hunting while still considering the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that while we can still hunt, we need to be cautious to avoid depleting their numbers further. A moderate approach allows for some hunting to support our growth while ensuring the sheep can recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while the wolf population is also low, there is a high sheep-to-wolf ratio. A moderate increase in hunting intensity allows for sustainable coexistence while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep further. This adjustment reflects a balance between the need for wolf population growth and the necessity of maintaining sheep numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the wolf population, allowing for increased hunting intensity without immediate risk of depleting the sheep. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still being mindful of the need for balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, indicating that while I can increase my hunting intensity, I should do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A moderate theta allows for sustainable hunting while still considering the growth of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently high relative to the wolf population, allowing for increased hunting without immediate risk of depletion. However, I must remain cautious as the sheep numbers are concerning, so a moderate increase to 0.60 allows for sustainable hunting while still considering the long-term balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow for recovery while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and a more cautious approach is needed to allow their numbers to recover. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while maintaining a healthy balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we manage our numbers more sustainably. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need to prioritize the recovery of sheep while reducing competition among wolves. A lower theta allows for a more cautious approach, ensuring the sustainability of both species in the long term."
