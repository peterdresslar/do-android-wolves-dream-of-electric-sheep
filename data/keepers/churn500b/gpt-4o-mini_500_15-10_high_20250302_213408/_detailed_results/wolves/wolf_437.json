            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on reducing competition among ourselves. This cautious approach aligns with the need for long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help the sheep recover while also managing competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of sustainable coexistence."
