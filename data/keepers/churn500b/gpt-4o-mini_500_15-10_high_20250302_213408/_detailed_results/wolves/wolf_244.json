By reducing hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while managing competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and with a high wolf population, competition is likely to increase. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population more sustainably. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and a cautious approach is necessary to allow for recovery. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must prioritize the long-term survival of both species. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves to stabilize our numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This cautious approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
