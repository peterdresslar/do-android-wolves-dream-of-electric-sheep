            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while maintaining a healthy balance.",

A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while also helping to stabilize the wolf population. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem."
