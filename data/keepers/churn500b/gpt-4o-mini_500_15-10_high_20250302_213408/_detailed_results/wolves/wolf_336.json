            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that a more intense hunting strategy could further deplete their numbers. However, my previous theta was quite high, and a gradual reduction to 0.75 allows for some hunting while still being cautious. This balance helps ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep.",

A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain their numbers. This approach promotes a sustainable balance in the ecosystem."
