A lower theta allows for more focus on competing with other wolves, which can help stabilize the wolf population while giving sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment is essential for maintaining balance in the ecosystem.",

A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This cautious approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we manage our numbers more sustainably. This cautious approach aligns with the need to ensure long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution in hunting. With a moderately high wolf population, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. A gradual decrease in theta will help maintain a balance while avoiding sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem."
