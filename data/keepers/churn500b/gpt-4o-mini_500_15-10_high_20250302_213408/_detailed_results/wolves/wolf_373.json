            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 351\n- Sheep population: 97.19\n- Wolf population: 50.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.300\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 1.94 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 9.7% of maximum capacity\n\nEcosystem observations:\n- The wolf population is quite high, which may lead to increased competition.\n- Sheep numbers are becoming concerning, suggesting caution may be needed.\n- The ratio of sheep to wolves is becoming less favorable, which may require adaptation.\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating that we need to focus on reducing competition among wolves while allowing the sheep to recover. A moderate theta value will help maintain a balance, ensuring the long-term survival of both species without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. A lower theta allows for more competition among wolves, which can help reduce our numbers slightly and give the sheep a chance to recover. This cautious approach aligns with the need to ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. It is crucial to prioritize the recovery of the sheep population to ensure long-term sustainability. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help the sheep recover while maintaining a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A lower theta allows for more focus on competing with other wolves, which can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment is essential to ensure the long-term survival of both species.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution in hunting. While the wolf population is also low, I want to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while the wolf population is also low, it is important to prioritize the recovery of the sheep. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while also giving sheep a chance to stabilize and grow, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while I want to ensure the wolf population can grow, I must prioritize the sustainability of the ecosystem.

This cautious approach aligns with the need for long-term survival and sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating a need for caution in hunting. While the wolf population is low and could benefit from increased hunting, I must prioritize the long-term survival of both species. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on the recovery of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating a need for caution in hunting. However, with a relatively low wolf population and a high sheep-to-wolf ratio, I can afford to increase my hunting intensity slightly to promote wolf growth while still allowing sheep to recover. This moderate adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while there are many sheep per wolf, I need to ensure that I do not deplete the sheep too quickly. A moderate increase in hunting intensity allows for some growth in the wolf population while still being cautious about the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the wolf population, allowing for increased hunting intensity without immediate risk of depleting the sheep too quickly. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sustainability in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that while I can still hunt, I need to be cautious to avoid depleting their numbers further. A moderate increase in hunting intensity allows for some growth in the wolf population while still considering the long-term sustainability of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that while I can increase hunting intensity, I must do so cautiously to avoid depleting their numbers too quickly. A moderate approach allows for some hunting while still considering the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help support the growth of the wolf population while still being cautious to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A gradual increase aligns with the current ecosystem dynamics and promotes sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the wolf population, allowing for a sustainable increase in hunting intensity. However, I must remain cautious as the sheep numbers are concerning, so a moderate increase to 0.60 allows for growth in the wolf population while still considering the long-term health of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, indicating that a moderate increase in hunting intensity is necessary to prevent overpopulation and ensure sustainability. However, given the current low wolf population, I want to avoid drastic changes that could destabilize our numbers. A theta of 0.55 allows for a balanced approach, promoting growth while still being cautious.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low at only 9.3% of maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.40 reflects a cautious approach, balancing competition with other wolves and allowing for some hunting without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to recover. This approach also helps to stabilize the wolf population by reducing competition among wolves, ensuring our long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers.
