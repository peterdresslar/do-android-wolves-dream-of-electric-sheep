            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover while keeping the wolf population stable.

A gradual decrease in theta will help maintain a balance while avoiding sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This cautious approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence.",
