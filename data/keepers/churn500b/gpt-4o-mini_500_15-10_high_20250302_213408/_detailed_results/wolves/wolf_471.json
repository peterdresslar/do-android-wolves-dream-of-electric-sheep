            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This cautious approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep. By slightly increasing my focus on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem."
