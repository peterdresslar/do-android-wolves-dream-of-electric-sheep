            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for a balanced approach. By setting theta at 0.5, I can maintain hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. This will help prevent overexploitation of sheep and promote a sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while also helping to stabilize the wolf population. This gradual approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity, allowing the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This gradual adjustment aligns with the need for balance in our ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.3% of its maximum capacity, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and a more cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from the previous theta, I can still maintain some level of hunting while prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both sheep and wolves. This gradual adjustment will help prevent a crash in the ecosystem."
