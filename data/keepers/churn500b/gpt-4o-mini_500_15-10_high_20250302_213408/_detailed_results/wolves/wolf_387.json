            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A lower theta allows for a focus on reducing competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover. This approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence and avoids depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on reducing competition among wolves. This approach aligns with the need for a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity, I can help sustain my pack while allowing the sheep population to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is critically low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on reducing competition among ourselves. This cautious approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both species."
