            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, and while my previous theta was effective, a slight reduction in hunting intensity is warranted to allow for sustainable coexistence. This adjustment acknowledges the need to balance hunting with the current sheep population while still allowing for some growth in the wolf population.",

A moderate increase allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling the wolf population to grow.",

By reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing the competition among wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we manage our numbers more sustainably. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
