            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution in hunting. A moderate theta allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some hunting to support wolf reproduction. This balance will help prevent the depletion of the sheep population and avoid increased competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution in hunting to allow sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. A moderate theta value will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This gradual adjustment will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep to recover while maintaining the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. A gradual decrease in theta will help stabilize the ecosystem without causing sudden changes."
