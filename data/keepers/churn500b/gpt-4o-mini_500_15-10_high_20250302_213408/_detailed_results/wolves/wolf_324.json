A moderate theta value of 0.5 strikes a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting coexistence while still allowing for some hunting to support our population.",

A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while reducing pressure on the wolf population, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species."
