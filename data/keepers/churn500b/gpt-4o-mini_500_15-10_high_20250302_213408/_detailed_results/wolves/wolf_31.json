A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we manage our numbers more sustainably. This cautious approach aligns with the need to ensure long-term survival for both species.",

A lower theta allows for a focus on reducing competition and giving the sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",

By reducing hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while managing competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",

A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on reducing competition among ourselves. This cautious approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence.",
