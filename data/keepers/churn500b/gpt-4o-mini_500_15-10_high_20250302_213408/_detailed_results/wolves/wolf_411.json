            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, enabling sheep to recover while preventing overexploitation. This strategy promotes long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta allows for a focus on reducing competition among wolves while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and with the wolf population being high, it is essential to focus on reducing competition among wolves. This lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a sustainable wolf population."
