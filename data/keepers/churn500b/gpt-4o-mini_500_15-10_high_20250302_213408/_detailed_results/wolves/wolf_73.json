By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing the competition among wolves. This moderate approach will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. It is crucial to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves to maintain our population. A lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",

By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from the previous theta, I can still focus on sustainable coexistence while allowing for some growth in the wolf population.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution in hunting. A moderate increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach helps maintain a balance between the two species.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while the wolf population is also low, it is important to prioritize the recovery of the sheep. A lower theta will allow for reduced hunting intensity, giving the sheep a chance to stabilize and grow, which is essential for the long-term balance of the ecosystem.",
