By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. This moderate approach helps maintain balance in the ecosystem.",

By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can help reduce the pressure on the sheep population, allowing it to recover while still maintaining a sustainable wolf population."
