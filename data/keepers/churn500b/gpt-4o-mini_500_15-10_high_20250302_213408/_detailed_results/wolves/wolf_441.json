            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution in hunting. However, with a relatively low wolf population and a high sheep-to-wolf ratio, a moderate increase in hunting intensity will allow for some growth in the wolf population while still giving sheep a chance to recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating a need for caution in hunting. However, the wolf population is also low, and there are many sheep per wolf, suggesting that a moderate increase in hunting intensity could support wolf growth without depleting the sheep too quickly. A theta of 0.45 allows for a gradual adjustment while still prioritizing the long-term balance of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, and with a low wolf population, we can afford to increase our hunting intensity slightly. This adjustment allows for sustainable coexistence while also promoting our growth as a pack. A moderate increase helps ensure we don",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating a need for caution in hunting. While the wolf population is low and could support more hunting, I want to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate adjustment allows for some hunting while still considering the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, and with a low wolf population, I can afford to increase my hunting intensity slightly. A theta of 0.55 allows for a balanced approach that supports wolf growth while still being cautious about the sheep population.",
