            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while also preventing overpopulation of wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain stability. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments to ensure long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This cautious approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species."
