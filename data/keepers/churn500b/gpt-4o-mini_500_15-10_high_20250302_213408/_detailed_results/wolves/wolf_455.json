            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is concerningly low, and the wolf population is relatively high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta allows for more focus on competition among wolves, which can help stabilize the wolf population while giving sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while reducing the pressure on our own population. This cautious approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and with a high wolf population, competition is increasing. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we manage our numbers more sustainably. This cautious approach will help maintain the balance in the ecosystem."
