By slightly increasing my hunting intensity, I can help maintain the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",

A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity, allowing the sheep population to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This cautious approach aligns with the need for long-term sustainability.",

A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance and avoids overexploitation.",
