            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while my previous theta allowed for some hunting, it is now essential to shift towards a more balanced approach. A moderate theta of 0.55 will help maintain the sheep population while still allowing for some hunting to support the wolf population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. By adopting a lower hunting intensity, I can help the sheep recover while also managing competition among wolves. This balance will support the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while preventing overhunting, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem."
