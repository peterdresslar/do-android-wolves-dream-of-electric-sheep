A slight increase in hunting intensity allows for some growth in our numbers while still being cautious about the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, and with a low wolf population, there is an opportunity to increase hunting intensity without risking immediate depletion of sheep. A moderate increase to 0.55 allows for sustainable hunting while still being cautious about the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and it is crucial to prioritize their recovery while still allowing for some hunting to sustain the wolf population. A moderate theta value will help maintain a balance, ensuring that both species can thrive without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both sheep and wolves while still competing with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competition among wolves. This approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species and avoids further depletion of the sheep.",

By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while ensuring the sheep have a chance to rebound, which is essential for the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution.
