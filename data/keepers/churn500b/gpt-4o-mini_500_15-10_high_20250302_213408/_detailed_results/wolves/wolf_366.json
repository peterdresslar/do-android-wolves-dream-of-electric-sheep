            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the current wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta allows for a focus on reducing competition among wolves while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. This cautious approach will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting, ensuring that I do not deplete the sheep further while still allowing for some reproduction among wolves. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution in hunting. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also considering the growth potential of our wolf population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and sustainable coexistence."
