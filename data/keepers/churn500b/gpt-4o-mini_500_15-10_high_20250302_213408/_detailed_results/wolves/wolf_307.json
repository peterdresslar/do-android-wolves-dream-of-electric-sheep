A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting to maintain our population. This approach balances the immediate need for food with the long-term sustainability of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. By lowering the hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while managing the wolf population sustainably.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance in the ecosystem without risking a crash.",

To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. A gradual adjustment will help maintain balance without causing drastic changes.",
