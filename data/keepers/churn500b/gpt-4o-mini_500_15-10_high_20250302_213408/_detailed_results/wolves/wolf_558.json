To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity further to allow the sheep population to recover. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",

A moderate approach allows for some hunting while still considering the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, and with a low wolf population, there is an opportunity to increase hunting intensity without risking immediate depletion of the sheep. A moderate increase to 0.55 allows for sustainable hunting while still considering the long-term balance needed for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the wolf population, allowing for increased hunting intensity without immediate risk of depleting the sheep too quickly. This adjustment supports the growth of the wolf population while still considering the need for sustainability."
