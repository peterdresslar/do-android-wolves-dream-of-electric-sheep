A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach aims to prevent further depletion of sheep and maintain a sustainable balance.",

By reducing my hunting intensity further, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
