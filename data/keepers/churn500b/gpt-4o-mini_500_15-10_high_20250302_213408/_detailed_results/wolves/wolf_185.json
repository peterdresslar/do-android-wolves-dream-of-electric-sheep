A lower theta allows for a focus on competition with other wolves, which will help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment is crucial for maintaining balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. This cautious approach will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",

This gradual adjustment helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
