However, with the wolf population being relatively low, I want to avoid overexploitation of the sheep, so a moderate increase in hunting intensity allows for sustainable coexistence while still promoting wolf growth.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating a need for caution. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while maintaining a sustainable balance.",

A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure on the sheep, allowing their numbers to recover while still enabling some hunting for our sustenance. This approach aligns with the need for a balanced coexistence and avoids depleting the sheep further.",
