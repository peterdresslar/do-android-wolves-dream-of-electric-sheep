            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and with the current high wolf population, it is essential to focus on reducing competition among wolves. This lower theta will allow sheep to recover while maintaining a sustainable wolf population. Gradual adjustments are key to avoiding drastic impacts on both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 2.3% of its maximum capacity, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. A gradual reduction in hunting intensity is necessary to allow the sheep to recover while still competing with other wolves. This approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. It is crucial to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both species and prevent a crash in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This adjustment helps maintain a balance and prevents overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution in hunting. While the wolf population is also low, increasing hunting intensity too quickly could lead to a rapid decline in sheep numbers, jeopardizing long-term sustainability. A moderate approach allows for some growth in the wolf population while giving sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from the previous theta, I can still support the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and a more cautious approach is needed to allow their numbers to recover. With the wolf population also relatively low, focusing on competition rather than intense hunting will help maintain balance and ensure long-term survival for both species.",
