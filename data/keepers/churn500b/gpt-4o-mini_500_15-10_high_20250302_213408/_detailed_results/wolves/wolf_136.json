            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for a more balanced approach. A moderate hunting intensity will allow for some sheep recovery while still ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. This adjustment helps avoid overexploitation of the sheep and promotes coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is quite low at 21.26, which indicates a need for caution in hunting to allow their numbers to recover. Given the high wolf population of 53, maintaining a moderate hunting intensity will help balance competition among wolves while still allowing for some hunting. This approach supports the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower hunting intensity will allow sheep to recover while we manage our numbers more sustainably. This gradual adjustment will help maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while being cautious about the wolf population. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This cautious approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. It is crucial to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while minimizing competition among wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight increase in hunting intensity is necessary to ensure the survival of the wolf population, but I must remain cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. This moderate adjustment allows for a balance that can help both populations recover over time.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution in hunting. While the wolf population is relatively low, I want to ensure that we do not deplete the sheep further, allowing for a gradual recovery. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution in hunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a balance and adapting to the current conditions.",
