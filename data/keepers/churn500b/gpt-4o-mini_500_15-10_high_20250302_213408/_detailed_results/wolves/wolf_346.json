            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta will help maintain balance and prevent overexploitation of the sheep while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting, ensuring a more sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This gradual approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and with the wolf population being quite high, it is essential to prioritize the recovery of the sheep. A lower theta will allow for reduced hunting pressure, giving the sheep a chance to rebound while also managing competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is quite low, and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while managing the wolf population sustainably.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution in hunting. A gradual decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still addressing competition among wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population. A gradual decrease in theta will help maintain balance without causing sudden disruptions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance without risking a crash in either population."
