            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure on the sheep, allowing their numbers to recover while also addressing the competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment helps maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution in hunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach helps maintain balance and ensures the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover. A gradual decrease in theta will help maintain a balance while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. While the wolf population is low, I want to avoid depleting the sheep further, so a slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the sustainability of both populations."
