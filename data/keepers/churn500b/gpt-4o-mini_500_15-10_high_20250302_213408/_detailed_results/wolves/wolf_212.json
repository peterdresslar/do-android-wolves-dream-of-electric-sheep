            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution in hunting to allow sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support wolf reproduction. This balance helps prevent over-depletion of sheep and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain their numbers. This approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence and avoids depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling wolves to maintain their numbers. This approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence and avoids sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is quite low at 19.49, which is only 1.9% of its maximum capacity. With the wolf population at 50.00, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable at 0.39. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help achieve this balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also addressing the high competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem and ensure the long-term survival of both species."
