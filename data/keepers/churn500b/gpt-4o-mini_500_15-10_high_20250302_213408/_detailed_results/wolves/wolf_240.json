A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain their numbers. This approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence and avoids the risk of depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while being cautious with our own population growth. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
