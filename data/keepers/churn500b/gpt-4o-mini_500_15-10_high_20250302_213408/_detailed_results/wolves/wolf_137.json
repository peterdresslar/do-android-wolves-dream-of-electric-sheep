            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta allows for reduced hunting intensity, giving sheep a chance to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This gradual adjustment aligns with the need for balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need to focus on reducing competition among wolves rather than intensifying hunting. This will allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low at only 21.26, which is concerning for the long-term survival of both species. With the wolf population being high at 53, increasing competition is likely. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.20 to 0.25 allows for a cautious approach to hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance and avoids over-depletion of sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep. By reducing hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species and allow the sheep population to stabilize.",

A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting, ensuring that I do not deplete the sheep further while still allowing for some hunting to support the wolf population. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance in the ecosystem.",

By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep to recover while maintaining our wolf population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and sustainable coexistence.",
