However, given the low wolf population and the need to ensure our long-term survival, a moderate increase in theta allows for growth while maintaining a sustainable balance.",

However, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep too quickly, as the wolf population is still low and requires careful management. This adjustment allows for a balance between hunting and maintaining the ecosystem",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 13.66 sheep per wolf, there is an opportunity to increase hunting intensity without jeopardizing the long-term balance. However, I will increase it gradually to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly and ensure sustainable cycles.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, which suggests that a moderate increase in hunting intensity is warranted to prevent overpopulation. However, given the relatively low wolf population, I want to avoid drastic changes that could destabilize our numbers. A theta of 0.55 allows for a balanced approach, promoting sustainable coexistence while still addressing the sheep population growth.",

While there are many sheep per wolf, the current state suggests a need for a balanced approach to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining our wolf population. A moderate theta will help us avoid depleting the sheep further and ensure sustainable coexistence.",

By reducing hunting intensity slightly, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both sheep and wolves while still competing with other wolves.",
