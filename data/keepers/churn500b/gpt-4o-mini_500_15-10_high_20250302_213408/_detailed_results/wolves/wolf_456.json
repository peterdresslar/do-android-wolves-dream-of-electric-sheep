A moderate hunting intensity allows for a balance that can help the sheep recover while still enabling the wolf population to thrive. This adjustment is necessary to avoid over-depleting the sheep and to ensure long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A moderate hunting intensity allows for some sheep recovery while still enabling wolves to sustain themselves. This balance is crucial to avoid depleting the sheep further and to ensure long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta allows for a focus on reducing competition and giving the sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species."
