This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still being mindful of the need for balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, but the wolf population is low, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment aims to balance the need for wolf population growth while being cautious not to deplete the sheep too quickly, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently concerningly high, and with a low wolf population, we can afford to increase our hunting intensity slightly. This adjustment will help us capitalize on the current sheep-to-wolf ratio while still being mindful of the need for sustainable practices. A moderate increase allows for growth in our population without risking a rapid depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while there are many sheep per wolf, we must be cautious to avoid depleting their numbers further. A moderate approach allows for some hunting to support our population while giving sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and it is crucial to allow them to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the ecosystem and ensure that both species can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low at only 10% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensifying hunting. This will allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a sustainable balance.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need to focus on reducing competition among wolves while allowing the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting.",
