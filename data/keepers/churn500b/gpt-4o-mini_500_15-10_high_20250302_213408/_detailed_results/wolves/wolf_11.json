            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for some increased hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction. However, given the concerning trend in sheep numbers, I want to ensure that we do not overhunt and deplete their population too quickly. A moderate increase in hunting will help maintain a balance while allowing for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, and while I want to increase hunting to ensure the wolf population can grow, I must do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A moderate increase allows for sustainable coexistence while still taking advantage of the current sheep-to-wolf ratio.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, indicating a need for increased hunting to prevent overpopulation and ensure sustainability. However, with the wolf population being relatively low, I want to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A moderate increase to 0.55 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf growth while still being cautious about the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, suggesting that we need to be cautious with our hunting to allow their numbers to recover. While there are many sheep per wolf, a moderate approach will help maintain balance and ensure the long-term survival of both species. This adjustment reflects a careful response to the current state of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating a need for caution. A lower theta allows for competition with other wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a balance and ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure on the sheep, allowing their numbers to recover while we manage our own population dynamics more sustainably."
