            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution in hunting. A moderate theta allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some hunting to support wolf reproduction. This balance helps prevent further depletion of the sheep population and reduces competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A moderate hunting intensity will allow sheep to recover while still enabling wolves to sustain themselves. This approach helps maintain a balance in the ecosystem without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some reproduction among wolves. This approach helps maintain a balance in the ecosystem without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating that we need to prioritize their recovery. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, we can allow the sheep to replenish while maintaining our own population stability. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments in response to changing conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. A lower theta allows for more competition among wolves, which can help stabilize our population while giving sheep a chance to recover. This cautious approach aligns with the need for long-term sustainability."
