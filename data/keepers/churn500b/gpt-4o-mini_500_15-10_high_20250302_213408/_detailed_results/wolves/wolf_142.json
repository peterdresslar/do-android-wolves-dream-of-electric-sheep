This adjustment supports the growth of the wolf population while still being mindful of the need for balance in the ecosystem.",

While there are many sheep per wolf, I want to ensure that we do not deplete the sheep too quickly.

By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, we can allow the sheep population to stabilize and grow, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
