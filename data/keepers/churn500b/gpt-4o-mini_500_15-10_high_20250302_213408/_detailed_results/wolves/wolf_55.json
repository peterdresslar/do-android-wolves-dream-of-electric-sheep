            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A moderate hunting intensity allows for some sheep recovery while still enabling wolves to sustain their numbers. This balance is crucial to avoid depleting the sheep further and to maintain a healthy ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A lower theta will allow sheep to recover while maintaining a sustainable wolf population. This gradual adjustment helps prevent overhunting and ensures long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta allows for a focus on reducing competition among wolves while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence and prevents overhunting."
