            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for a balanced approach. A moderate theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while also giving sheep a chance to recover. This strategy aims to prevent overexploitation of the sheep and maintain a sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting, ensuring a sustainable balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is quite low at only 2.3% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will allow sheep to recover while reducing pressure on the wolf population, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species and allow the sheep population to recover without putting too much pressure on them.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.9% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is moderately high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep by reducing hunting intensity. This cautious approach will help stabilize the ecosystem and allow for sustainable coexistence."
