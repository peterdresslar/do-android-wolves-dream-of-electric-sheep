            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A moderate hunting intensity will allow for some sheep recovery while still enabling wolves to thrive. This approach helps maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is relatively high, indicating increased competition. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain their numbers. This approach helps to avoid over-depletion of sheep and supports a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This cautious approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence and avoids depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This cautious approach helps ensure long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and with a high wolf population, competition among wolves is likely to increase. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This gradual adjustment will help maintain balance in the ecosystem."
