            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 463\n- Sheep population: 38.82\n- Wolf population: 60.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.300\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.65 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 3.9% of maximum capacity\n\nEcosystem observations:\n- The wolf population is quite high, which may lead to increased competition.\n- Sheep numbers are becoming concerning, suggesting caution may be needed.\n- The ratio of sheep to wolves is becoming less favorable, which may require adaptation.\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 2.9% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on reducing competition among wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. A lower theta allows for a focus on competition among wolves, which can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to recover. Gradual adjustments are key to maintaining balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. It is essential to focus on competition with other wolves to allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both species by preventing overhunting and allowing for a more sustainable ecosystem.",

A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent further depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution in hunting to allow their numbers to recover. At the same time, the wolf population is relatively low, suggesting that I can gradually increase my hunting intensity without risking immediate depletion of the sheep. A small increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that considers both the current state and the trends in the populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution in hunting. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while still focusing on competing with other wolves. This approach supports the long-term survival of both species and avoids depleting the sheep further.",

A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",

A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating a need for caution in hunting. However, with a relatively low wolf population and a high sheep-to-wolf ratio, I can afford to increase my hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. This moderate adjustment aims for a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating a need for caution in hunting. However, the wolf population is also low, and there are many sheep per wolf, suggesting that a moderate increase in hunting intensity could support wolf reproduction while still allowing for sheep recovery. This adjustment aims for a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and there are many sheep available per wolf, indicating an opportunity for increased hunting. However, I must remain cautious as the sheep numbers are concerning, and a gradual increase in hunting intensity will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, indicating a need for increased hunting to prevent overpopulation. However, given the relatively low wolf population, I want to avoid overexploitation of the sheep and maintain a balance that allows both populations to thrive. A moderate increase to 0.55 allows for sustainable hunting while still considering the long-term health of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently concerningly high, indicating that a slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted to help balance the ecosystem. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 10.64, there is room for sustainable hunting without risking immediate depletion. This adjustment allows for potential growth in the wolf population while still being cautious about the sheep numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating a need for caution in hunting. While the wolf population is low, which allows for some increase in hunting intensity, I want to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate adjustment to 0.55 allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some growth in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently high relative to the wolf population, allowing for increased hunting intensity without immediate risk of depleting the sheep. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still considering the long-term balance of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both sheep and wolves, while still allowing for some competition among wolves.",
