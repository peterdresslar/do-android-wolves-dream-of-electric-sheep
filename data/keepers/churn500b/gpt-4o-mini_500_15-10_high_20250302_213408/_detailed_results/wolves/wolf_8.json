            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 31\n- Sheep population: 115.50\n- Wolf population: 25.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.550\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 4.62 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 11.5% of maximum capacity\n\nEcosystem observations:\n- Sheep numbers are becoming concerning, suggesting caution may be needed.\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

A moderate theta allows for some hunting while still giving sheep a chance to rebound, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A lower theta allows for more competition among wolves, which can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",

While the wolf population is low and could benefit from increased hunting, the current sheep-to-wolf ratio suggests that we should prioritize sustainability over immediate gains. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still being mindful of the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, and while the wolf population is low, it is crucial to prioritize the long-term survival of both species. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also reducing competition among wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",

This suggests that I can increase my hunting intensity to take advantage of the abundant sheep while still allowing for sustainable coexistence. A theta of 0.60 strikes a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting growth in my pack without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
