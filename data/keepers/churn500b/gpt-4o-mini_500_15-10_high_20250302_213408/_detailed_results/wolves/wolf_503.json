A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure on the sheep, allowing their numbers to recover while we manage our own population dynamics more sustainably.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. A slight increase in hunting intensity is necessary to ensure my pack can sustain itself, but I must remain cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. This adjustment allows for a gradual response to the current ecosystem state while still prioritizing the long-term survival of both species.",

To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. A gradual decrease in theta will help maintain balance without causing sudden crashes.",
