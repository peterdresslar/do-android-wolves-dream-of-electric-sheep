            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution in hunting to allow sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support wolf reproduction. This balance will help prevent a crash in the sheep population and ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain its health. This approach balances the immediate need for food with the long-term sustainability of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity, allowing the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem."
