            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. A moderate theta value will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and with a high wolf population, it is crucial to focus on sustainable coexistence. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A lower theta allows for a focus on reducing competition among wolves while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment helps maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. By focusing on competition and reducing hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while maintaining the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure on the sheep, allowing their numbers to recover while we manage our own population dynamics. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance."
