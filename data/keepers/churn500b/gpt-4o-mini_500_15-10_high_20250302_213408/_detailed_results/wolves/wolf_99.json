            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while managing competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is quite low at 2.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution in hunting to allow their numbers to recover. With the wolf population being relatively high, focusing more on competition among wolves will help stabilize our numbers while giving sheep a chance to bounce back. A gradual adjustment to 0.30 reflects a balanced approach that prioritizes long-term sustainability."
