            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. By reducing hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while managing competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. A gradual decrease in theta will help maintain a balance while avoiding sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach aims to maintain a sustainable balance without risking a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to rebound, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that a more cautious approach is needed to allow for recovery. While the wolf population is low and could benefit from increased hunting, I must prioritize the long-term balance of the ecosystem. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still being mindful of the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, and while the wolf population is low, it is important to allow the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help maintain a balance and prevent overhunting, ensuring both species can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, and while I want to increase hunting to support wolf reproduction, I must do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A moderate increase allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some growth in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, and with a low wolf population, there is an opportunity to increase hunting intensity without risking immediate depletion of the sheep. A moderate increase to 0.55 allows for sustainable hunting while still considering the long-term balance of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and it is crucial to focus on allowing them to recover. By reducing hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, while also maintaining a healthy balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species and maintains a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and a cautious approach is needed to allow for their recovery while still maintaining some hunting to support the wolf population. This moderate value balances the need for sustenance with the necessity of ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain their numbers. This approach supports long-term sustainability and avoids drastic changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution.
