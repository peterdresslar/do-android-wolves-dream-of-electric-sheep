            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 12\n- Sheep population: 35.00\n- Wolf population: 4.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.450\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 8.75 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 3.5% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and maintaining a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 1.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that they need time to recover. A lower theta value allows for more competition among wolves, which can help stabilize our population while giving sheep a chance to increase. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I need to maintain a balance, a slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted to ensure the wolf population can thrive. However, I must be cautious and avoid overhunting, as the sheep need time to recover. A gradual adjustment allows for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.19, which is only 1.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This gradual adjustment helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.54, which is only 2.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach to hunting while still considering the need for coexistence and the potential for sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity to ensure the survival of my pack, I must do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting sustainable coexistence while still enabling my pack to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.70, which is only 2.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring a balance that supports both populations in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.55, which is only 2.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.58, which is only 2.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that the sheep need time to recover, so I will focus more on competing with other wolves to ensure our population remains stable while allowing the sheep to gradually increase. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 will help maintain a balance without overexploiting the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I need to maintain a balance, a slight increase in hunting intensity will help support the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 3.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that they need time to recover. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will allow for some reproduction among wolves while still giving sheep a chance to bounce back. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35, which is only 3.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing competition with other wolves, ensuring a balance that supports both populations in the long term."
