            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.3% of its maximum capacity, and my previous theta was quite low at 0.037. To allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a focus on competition with other wolves, a gradual increase to 0.25 strikes a balance that supports both populations without risking immediate depletion of sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 63.41, which is only 6.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, ensuring long-term sustainability for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. This indicates that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow the sheep population to recover while still enabling some hunting to sustain the wolf population. A gradual increase from my previous theta will help maintain balance without overwhelming the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 5.70, which is just 0.6% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity and give the sheep a chance to rebound, while also managing the competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.3% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must prioritize the recovery of the sheep. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, promoting a more sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity. Focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to recover, ensuring their long-term survival and ultimately benefiting our wolf population in the future. A lower theta will help maintain balance and prevent a crash in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution in hunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance."
