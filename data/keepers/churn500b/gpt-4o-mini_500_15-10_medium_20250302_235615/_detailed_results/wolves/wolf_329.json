            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.3% of maximum capacity, indicating that a more moderate hunting approach is necessary to allow the sheep to recover. This theta value balances the need for hunting to support wolf reproduction while also considering the sustainability of the sheep population. It reflects a cautious approach to ensure both species can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 63.41, which is only 6.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of both populations, ensuring that we do not deplete the sheep further and can maintain a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. This gradual approach will help maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.3% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. It is essential to focus on reducing competition among wolves to allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both species by preventing further depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. A slight increase in hunting intensity will allow for some reproduction among wolves while still giving sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance without risking a crash in either population.",
