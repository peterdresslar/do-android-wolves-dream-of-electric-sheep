            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15, which is only 1.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.40 strikes a balance between competing with other wolves and allowing the sheep population to stabilize, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I want to ensure the survival of my pack, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, preventing overexploitation of the sheep while still allowing for some hunting to support our population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.86, which is only 1.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still being mindful of the need to avoid overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.97, which is only 1.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population. This gradual adjustment will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.54, which is only 2.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that the sheep need time to recover, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to rebuild their numbers. Additionally, with a wolf population of 6.00, focusing more on competition among wolves will help maintain our numbers while ensuring the sheep can thrive. A gradual adjustment allows for a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.10, which is only 2.2% of its maximum capacity.
