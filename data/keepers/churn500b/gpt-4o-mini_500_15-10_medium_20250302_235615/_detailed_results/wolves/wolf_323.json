            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.3% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 63.41, which is only 6.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 5.70, which is only 0.6% of its maximum capacity. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover and prevent further depletion. Given the current wolf population is high, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 3.12, which is just 0.3% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the survival of my pack, I must also allow the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance, allowing for some hunting while still prioritizing the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. This lower theta will help maintain a balance and prevent a crash in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover.
