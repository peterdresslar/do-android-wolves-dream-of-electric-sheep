            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 19.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. A moderate increase in theta allows for more hunting to support wolf reproduction while still considering the long-term health of the sheep population. This adjustment is gradual and aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level (17.7% of maximum capacity), which allows for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This value balances the need to sustain our wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover. It reflects a cautious approach, considering the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the importance of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring both can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 62.70, which is only 6.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring that we do not deplete the sheep further and can maintain a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.86, which is only 3.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover, and focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to regain their numbers while preventing overhunting. A gradual approach will help maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.41, which is only 2.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a slight hunting intensity. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.30 to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep further."
