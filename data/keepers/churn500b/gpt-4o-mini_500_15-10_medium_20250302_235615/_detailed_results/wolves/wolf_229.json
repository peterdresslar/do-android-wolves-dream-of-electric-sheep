            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This adjustment reflects a balanced approach, considering both the current sheep population and the need to avoid overhunting as the wolf population is low.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 23.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with a relatively small wolf population of 5, I need to be cautious about overhunting. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to thrive. This moderate approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sustainable coexistence. A gradual increase helps maintain balance as both populations are dynamic.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 26.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. A moderate theta of 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, enabling me to focus on competition with other wolves while still allowing the sheep population to recover. This strategy supports the long-term survival of both species and avoids depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A gradual increase is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low percentage of its maximum capacity, and while it is important to maintain a healthy wolf population, I need to allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help ensure sustainable coexistence while still allowing for some hunting to support our pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 63.41, which is only 6.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.4 to 0.35, I can maintain a focus on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring a balance that supports both populations in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a severe depletion of prey. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing competition among wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for long-term sustainability."
