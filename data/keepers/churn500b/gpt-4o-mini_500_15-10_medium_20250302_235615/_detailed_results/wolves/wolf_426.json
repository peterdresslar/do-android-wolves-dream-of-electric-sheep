This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. A theta of 0.3 represents a moderate approach that balances the need for wolves to compete with each other while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. A gradual decrease in theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",

To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep population. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while reducing competition among wolves, which is essential given the current high wolf population.",

A slight increase in hunting intensity will help balance the needs of my pack while still allowing the sheep population a chance to recover.",
