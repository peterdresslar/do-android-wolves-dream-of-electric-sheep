            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 27.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with a relatively high sheep-to-wolf ratio of 6.28, I need to be cautious not to overhunt and deplete the sheep population too quickly. A moderate increase in hunting intensity allows for a balance between ensuring wolf reproduction and maintaining sheep numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 23.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with a wolf population of 76, it is wise to maintain a moderate approach to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly while still allowing for some hunting to support wolf reproduction. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.3% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a need for caution in hunting. By lowering my hunting intensity slightly, I can allow the sheep to recover while still competing with other wolves. This approach promotes a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 63.41, which is only 6.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 14.71, which is only 1.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for wolves to sustain their population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. This approach will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem."
