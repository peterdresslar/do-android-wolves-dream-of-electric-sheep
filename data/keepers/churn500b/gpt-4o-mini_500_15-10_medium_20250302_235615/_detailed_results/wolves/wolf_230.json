            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This moderate approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, as it allows for some reproduction among wolves without depleting the sheep population too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that balances the needs of both wolves and sheep. This approach will help maintain the sheep population while ensuring our wolf pack remains healthy and avoids overexploitation of our prey.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 26.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with a relatively high sheep-to-wolf ratio of 19.04, it is wise to maintain a cautious approach to avoid over-depleting the sheep. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced strategy that supports both sheep recovery and wolf population stability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 27.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 23, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 27.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 43.00, I need to be cautious about overhunting. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. It reflects a cautious approach to ensure both populations can thrive in the long term.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 63.41, which is only 6.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is a need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support the wolf population. By setting theta at 0.35, I can ensure a gradual approach that balances competition with other wolves and hunting, promoting sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 14.71, which is only 1.5% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover.
