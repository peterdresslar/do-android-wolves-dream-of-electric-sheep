            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 6.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that we should be cautious with our hunting intensity. A moderate theta of 0.55 allows us to maintain a balance between hunting and competing with other wolves, ensuring the sheep can recover while still supporting our wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.86, which is only 3.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for some hunting to support our pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.41, which is only 2.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing competition with other wolves, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity and give the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, while also allowing the wolf population to stabilize without competing too aggressively.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the survival of the sheep, which is crucial for the long-term health of our ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 0.7% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the survival of my pack, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable for hunting. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to recover while ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their depletion. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for a sustainable balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover and increases their population, which is crucial for the long-term survival of both species. Additionally, with a high wolf population, focusing on competition rather than hunting will help stabilize our numbers without depleting the sheep further."
