            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 63.41, which is only 6.3% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.45 strikes a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.6% of maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low at 0.03. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover while minimizing competition among wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.3% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting sheep. This will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to recover while also addressing the competition with other wolves. This approach promotes long-term sustainability for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep population a chance to recover, which is essential for the long-term survival of both species. Gradual adjustments are key, and at this stage, focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting is the most sustainable approach.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity. Focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to recover, ensuring a sustainable future for both species. A gradual approach is essential to avoid further depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity. Increasing my hunting intensity could lead to the extinction of the sheep, which would ultimately harm the wolf population as well. A gradual increase in theta allows for a focus on competition with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution in hunting. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.20 to 0.25, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to rebuild their numbers while also managing competition with other wolves. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of sustainable coexistence."
