            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level (14.6% of maximum capacity), allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf reproduction and sheep recovery, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This approach supports the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, as it allows for sustainable coexistence without depleting the sheep population too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without risking depletion. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, enabling me to hunt enough to support the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 77.70, which is only 7.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.35, I can focus more on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 53.99, which is only 5.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while allowing the sheep population to gradually increase.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 38.10, which is only 3.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting to support the wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a cautious approach to hunting without risking a rapid depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.87, which is only 2.8% of its maximum capacity. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover while also addressing the competition among wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and promotes long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.32, which is only 2.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should remain low to allow the sheep to recover. However, with a wolf population of 86, there is a need to slightly increase hunting to ensure the wolves can sustain themselves without depleting the sheep too quickly. A gradual increase to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 1.7% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are not enough sheep to sustain aggressive hunting. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing competition with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.4% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover while preventing overcompetition among wolves. This balance is crucial for the long-term survival of both species."
