            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 109\n- Sheep population: 4.59\n- Wolf population: 35.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.250\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.13 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 0.5% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.6% of maximum capacity, and my previous theta was quite low at 0.231. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I will gradually increase my hunting intensity while still focusing on competition with other wolves. This moderate increase to 0.3 allows for a balanced approach that can help the sheep recover while maintaining a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 62.70, which is only 6.3% of its maximum capacity. While I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, enabling some hunting while still allowing the sheep population to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.86, which is only 3.6% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting intensively. This will help balance the populations and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.41, which is only 2.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a slight hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.30 to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, ensuring that both populations can stabilize and thrive without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover rather than intensifying our hunting. By maintaining a lower theta, we can reduce competition among wolves and promote a healthier ecosystem for both species in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure and give the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, while still allowing for some competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 0.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should remain cautious to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta will help balance the need for sustenance while still considering the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 0.6% of its maximum capacity. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.09, it is crucial to focus on allowing the sheep to recover rather than intensifying hunting. By maintaining a lower theta, I can prioritize competition with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. By focusing on competition with other wolves instead of hunting, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable for hunting. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity, I can help the wolf population maintain its health while still allowing the sheep to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to rebound while also managing competition with other wolves. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both species."
