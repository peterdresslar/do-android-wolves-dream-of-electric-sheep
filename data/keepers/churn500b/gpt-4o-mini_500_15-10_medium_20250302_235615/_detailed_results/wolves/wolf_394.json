            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 167\n- Sheep population: 63.41\n- Wolf population: 192.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.144\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.33 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 6.3% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 179\n- Sheep population: 0.71\n- Wolf population: 37.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.250\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.02 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 0.1% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 63.41, which is only 6.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.25 reflects a cautious approach, focusing more on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the wolf population is relatively high. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while preventing overcompetition among wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments to ensure long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.3% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity. Increasing hunting intensity could lead to the extinction of sheep, jeopardizing the long-term survival of both species. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain a balance and prevent further depletion of the sheep, while also addressing the competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to gradually increase in number while also managing competition with other wolves. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both species.",

A gradual approach will help maintain balance in the ecosystem without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their depletion. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover. This balance is crucial for the long-term survival of both species.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery.
