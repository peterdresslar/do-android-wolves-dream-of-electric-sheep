            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 6.3% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are not enough sheep to sustain a high hunting intensity without risking a crash in the sheep population. A lower theta allows for competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 14.71, which is only 1.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to gradually increase. This approach aligns with the wisdom of making small adjustments and ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a high level of competition among wolves. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while preventing overcompetition among wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 3.12, which is only 0.3% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure long-term sustainability, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting sheep. This lower theta will help balance the ecosystem and give the sheep a chance to increase their numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 2.06, which is just 0.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution in hunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a gradual adjustment while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity. Focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to recover, ensuring a sustainable future for both species. A gradual approach is necessary to avoid sudden population crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. A gradual increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance while still considering the competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.97, which is only 0.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.30 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need to compete with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain wolf health. It is important to avoid overhunting at this critical time.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity. Focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting will allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem. A gradual approach is necessary to avoid further depletion of the sheep population."
