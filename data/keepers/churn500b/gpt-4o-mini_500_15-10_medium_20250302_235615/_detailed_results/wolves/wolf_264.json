            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 27.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. A moderate theta of 0.55 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while ensuring that the sheep population can recover and thrive. This gradual adjustment helps maintain the delicate balance in our ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting approach. This will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term survival for both. As the sheep population is still recovering, a slight reduction in hunting intensity will help prevent over-depletion while allowing for gradual wolf population growth.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low percentage of its maximum capacity, and while it is important to maintain a healthy wolf population, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help sustain both populations in the long term, while still allowing for some hunting to support our needs.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 63.41, which is only 6.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to ensure our own survival. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing competition with other wolves and the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 5.70, which is just 0.6% of its maximum capacity. Maintaining a low hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover and prevents further depletion. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.03, it is essential to prioritize the long-term survival of both species by focusing on competition with other wolves rather than aggressive hunting."
