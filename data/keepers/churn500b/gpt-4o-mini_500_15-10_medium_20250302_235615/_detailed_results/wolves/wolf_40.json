            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain the wolf population while still ensuring that the sheep can recover over time. A moderate adjustment from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, avoiding sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level (13.0% of maximum capacity), allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking their long-term survival. This adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf reproduction and sheep recovery, ensuring sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.6% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate hunting approach that can help sustain both the sheep and wolf populations. This value balances the need for hunting to support wolf reproduction while also allowing the sheep to recover. It reflects a cautious strategy that avoids overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 77.70, which is only 7.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.35, I can focus more on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 53.99, which is only 5.4% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 38.10, which is only 3.8% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the survival of my pack, I must also allow the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will enable me to maintain some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term balance of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.87, which is only 2.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to allow the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.32, which is only 2.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a slight focus on hunting to support our wolf population. A small increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.22, it is crucial to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to stabilize. A lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both species by promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 1.4% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A gradual reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance and prevent a crash in the ecosystem."
