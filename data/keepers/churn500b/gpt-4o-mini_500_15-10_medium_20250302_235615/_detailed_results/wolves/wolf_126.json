            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, allowing for some recovery while still maintaining a focus on competition with other wolves. This moderate approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both populations and avoids depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.6% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. A gradual increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, enabling sustainable coexistence while still allowing for wolf population growth.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 6.3% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. A lower theta allows for more competition among wolves, which can help stabilize our numbers while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 3.6% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.41, which is only 2.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to be cautious with our hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for wolves to sustain their population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species."
