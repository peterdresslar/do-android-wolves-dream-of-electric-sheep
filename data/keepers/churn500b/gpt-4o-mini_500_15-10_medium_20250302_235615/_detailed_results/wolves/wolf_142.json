            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while preventing over-depletion of the sheep. This balance will help maintain both populations in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.7% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This value balances the need for wolf reproduction with the sustainability of the sheep population, ensuring both can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.6% of its maximum capacity, which suggests that a lower hunting intensity is appropriate to allow the sheep to recover. Additionally, with the wolf population being slightly higher than the sheep population, focusing on competition among wolves will help maintain our numbers while giving the sheep a chance to rebound. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 62.70, which is only 6.3% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, a slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted to help balance the ecosystem without depleting the sheep too quickly. This moderate adjustment allows for sustainable coexistence while still being mindful of the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the wolf population is relatively high. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain their numbers. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of sustainable coexistence and avoids sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.41, which is only 2.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting sheep, allowing their population to stabilize and grow. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.56, which is only 1.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to allow the sheep to recover while also considering the growing wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for some hunting to support our needs, but it is still cautious enough to avoid depleting the sheep further. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash in both populations."
