            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 168\n- Sheep population: 14.71\n- Wolf population: 201.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.396\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.07 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 1.5% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 5.70, which is only 0.6% of its maximum capacity. Maintaining a low hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover and increase their numbers, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem. Given the high wolf population, it is crucial to focus on competition among wolves rather than depleting the already scarce sheep resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 3.12, which is just 0.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to gradually increase while also managing competition with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and my previous focus on hunting has contributed to their decline. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while still competing with other wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity further. This will allow the sheep population to recover while minimizing competition among wolves. A gradual approach is essential to maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their extinction. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.20 to 0.25, I can still focus on competition with other wolves while allowing the sheep population a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their extinction. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a gradual adjustment towards hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.79, which is only 0.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.30 represents a cautious approach, focusing more on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By reducing my hunting intensity further, I can allow the sheep to replenish while also managing competition with other wolves. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and my previous theta was too focused on hunting. By increasing it slightly to 0.30, I can shift my focus towards competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a more balanced approach, enabling me to focus on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to support reproduction.",

By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution in hunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a bit more hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to replenish their numbers while also managing competition with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and my previous theta was already on the lower end. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for a modest increase in hunting intensity, which can help sustain my pack while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a balance and adapting to the current conditions.",
