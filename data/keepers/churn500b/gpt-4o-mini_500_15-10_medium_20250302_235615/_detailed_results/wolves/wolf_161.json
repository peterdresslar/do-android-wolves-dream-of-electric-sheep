            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.7% of maximum capacity, allowing for a gradual increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This value also reflects a cautious approach to avoid overexploitation while still competing with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.6% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 62.70, which is only 6.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to increase, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.86, which is only 3.6% of its maximum capacity. While I need to focus on hunting to ensure the survival of my pack, I must also be cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting sustainable coexistence while still addressing the needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.41, which is only 2.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to gradually increase while ensuring the wolf population remains stable. This approach aligns with the wisdom of making small adjustments and prioritizing long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.56, which is only 1.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that they are vulnerable and need time to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.30 to 0.35, I can still focus on competition with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. Focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to recover while preventing overhunting and ensuring the long-term survival of both species. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a significant competition for resources among wolves. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a bit more hunting to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance as I monitor both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 7.06, which is only 0.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are in a vulnerable state, and focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting will allow the sheep population to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while avoiding a potential crash in the ecosystem."
