This indicates that the sheep need time to recover, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to increase their numbers. Additionally, with the wolf population at 97, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 38.10, which is only 3.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.30 reflects a cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.87, which is only 2.8% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will enable me to maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting a sustainable ecosystem.",

This indicates that the sheep are in a vulnerable state, and I need to focus on allowing them to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a more balanced approach, promoting coexistence while being cautious not to deplete the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.4% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low at 0.20. This indicates that the sheep are under significant pressure, and focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both species by preventing overhunting.",

To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting intensively. This lower theta will help balance the populations and prevent a crash.",

Increasing it slightly to 0.30 allows for a more balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing the sheep population to recover. This gradual adjustment helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",

Maintaining a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for long-term sustainability.",
