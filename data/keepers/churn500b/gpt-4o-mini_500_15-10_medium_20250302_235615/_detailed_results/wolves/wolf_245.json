            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 27.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for increased hunting without risking depletion. However, with a wolf population of 23, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A theta of 0.75 allows for a more intense hunting strategy while still considering the sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 27.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with a relatively high wolf population, it is important to avoid overhunting and allow for a balance that supports both species. A moderate decrease from my previous theta will help maintain this balance while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain our wolf population while ensuring the sheep can recover and thrive. A balanced approach is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly, especially as we are still below the maximum capacity.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low percentage of its maximum capacity, allowing for some hunting without risking depletion. However, with the wolf population also being significant, a moderate approach will help maintain balance and prevent overhunting while allowing sheep to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 63.41, which is only 6.3% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and avoid depleting their numbers further, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting. This moderate adjustment will help maintain balance in the ecosystem while ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 1.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. With a high wolf population, focusing on competition among wolves rather than hunting will help maintain balance and ensure the long-term survival of both species."
