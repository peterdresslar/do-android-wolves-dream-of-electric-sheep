            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level (14.6% of maximum capacity), allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover over time. A gradual increase in theta will support sustainable coexistence as conditions change.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with a relatively high wolf population, it is important to avoid overhunting to ensure both species can thrive. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance while allowing for the sheep population to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.6% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking their long-term survival. This balance will help sustain both populations while avoiding overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 77.70, which is only 7.8% of its maximum capacity. While my previous theta of 0.600 allowed for some hunting, it is important to shift towards a more balanced approach to allow the sheep population to recover. A moderate theta of 0.45 will help maintain a sustainable coexistence while still allowing for some hunting to support the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 53.99, which is only 5.4% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 38.10, which is only 3.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. This lower theta will help maintain a balance and prevent overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.87, which is only 2.8% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will enable me to maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 2.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to replenish while also managing competition with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and promotes long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we are in a precarious position. A slight increase in hunting intensity will allow for some reproduction among wolves while still giving sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 1.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to replenish their numbers while also managing competition with other wolves. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 12, which is only 1.2% of its maximum capacity. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover and prevents overexploitation. Given the high wolf population of 61, it"
