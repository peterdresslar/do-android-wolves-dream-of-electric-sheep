            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 63.41, which is only 6.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.211 allows for some hunting to support reproduction, but not enough to deplete the sheep further. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 14.71, which is only 1.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to gradually increase. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low at 0.03. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both species by preventing overhunting and allowing for a more sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.3% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover while competing with other wolves. A gradual increase in theta will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while avoiding further depletion of the sheep.",

Gradual adjustments are key, so I will maintain a low theta to prioritize the long-term survival of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting would further deplete their numbers and jeopardize the long-term survival of both species. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This balance will help ensure that wolves can thrive without pushing sheep to the brink of extinction.",

By slightly increasing my theta from 0.20 to 0.25, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to replenish while also reducing competition among wolves, which is crucial for our long-term survival. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of adapting to changing conditions without causing sudden disruptions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution in hunting. While I want to ensure the survival of my pack, I must also allow the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach to hunting while still prioritizing the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.1% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable for hunting.
