            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level (14.0% of maximum capacity), and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite high (17.46 sheep per wolf). This suggests that while there is an opportunity for hunting, it is crucial to avoid overexploitation to allow the sheep population to recover. A moderate theta value will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual increase is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term health of both sheep and wolves. This moderate adjustment will help maintain balance as the sheep population is recovering, while also considering the growth of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery. A gradual increase aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and while I want to ensure the survival of my pack, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain the balance and support both populations in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.0% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.6% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. However, since the wolf population is relatively high, I want to maintain a cautious approach to ensure sustainable coexistence and avoid overhunting. A gradual increase in theta will help balance the needs of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 77.70, which is only 7.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without risking depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 5.4% of maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are not enough sheep to sustain aggressive hunting. By adopting a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to recover while ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 38.10, which is only 3.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep population. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to rebound while also managing the competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.87, which is only 2.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.30 to 0.35, I can still hunt effectively while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This small adjustment aligns with the wisdom of making gradual changes and helps maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the long-term survival of both species."
