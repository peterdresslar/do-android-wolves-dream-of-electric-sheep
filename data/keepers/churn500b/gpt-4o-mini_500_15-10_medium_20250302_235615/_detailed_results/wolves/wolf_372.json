While I want to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for some hunting to sustain wolf reproduction while also giving sheep a chance to increase their numbers, promoting a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help create a more sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 5.70, which is only 0.6% of its maximum capacity. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover and increase their numbers, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem. Additionally, with a high wolf population of 179, focusing on competition among wolves rather than aggressive hunting will help stabilize our numbers while giving sheep a chance to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 3.12, which is only 0.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. A gradual approach will help maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery. With the wolf population being relatively high, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. Focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to recover while preventing overexploitation. This gradual approach will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity, I can help maintain the balance while still allowing the sheep population to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of avoiding sudden changes and focusing on long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity. Increasing hunting intensity could lead to the depletion of sheep, jeopardizing both their survival and our long-term food source. A moderate approach allows for some hunting while giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their extinction.
