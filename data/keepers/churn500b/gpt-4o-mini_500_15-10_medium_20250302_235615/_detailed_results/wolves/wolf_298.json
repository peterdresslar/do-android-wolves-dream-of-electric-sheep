            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently healthy at 239.02, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still maintaining a sustainable balance with the sheep population. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio of 3.15, a slight decrease from my previous theta will help prevent overhunting and allow for the sheep to recover further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 16.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. A moderate theta allows for a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring both populations can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 63.41, which is only 6.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting to maintain the wolf population. A theta of 0.45 strikes a balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep, promoting sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. Focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to recover while preventing overhunting, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A gradual reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance and prevent further depletion of the sheep.",
