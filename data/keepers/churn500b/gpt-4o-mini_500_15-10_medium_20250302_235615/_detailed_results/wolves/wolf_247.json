            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 27.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover gradually. This approach aligns with the wisdom of making small adjustments to adapt to the current ecosystem state.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that balances the needs of both wolves and sheep. This approach will help maintain the sheep population while ensuring that the wolf population can thrive without depleting resources too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 16.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a more cautious approach, balancing the need for wolf reproduction with the health of the sheep population as we adapt to the current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 63.41, which is only 6.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to stabilize while still competing with other wolves. This moderate approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 14.71, which is only 1.5% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population, which is crucial for the future of my pack."
