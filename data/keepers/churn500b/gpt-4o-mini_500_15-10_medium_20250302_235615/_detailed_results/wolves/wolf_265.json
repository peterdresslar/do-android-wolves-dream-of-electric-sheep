        "explanations": [
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level (27% of maximum capacity), and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite high (6.28). This indicates that there is a significant amount of prey available, allowing for a gradual increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. However, I want to maintain a cautious approach to ensure the long-term survival of both species, so I will focus more on competition with other wolves for now.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 23.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. A moderate increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level (16.3% of maximum capacity), which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking immediate depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 63.41, which is only 6.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is quite high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 5.70, which is 0.6% of its maximum capacity. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover and increases their population, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem. Additionally, with a high wolf population of 179, focusing on competition among wolves rather than aggressive hunting will help stabilize our numbers and prevent overexploitation of the sheep."
