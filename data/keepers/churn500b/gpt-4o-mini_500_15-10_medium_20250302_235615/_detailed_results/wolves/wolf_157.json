            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.7% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking their long-term survival. This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing sheep to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.6% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations while ensuring our pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 6.3% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are fewer sheep available per wolf. A moderate hunting intensity will allow for some reproduction among wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.86, which is only 3.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.40 strikes a balance between competing with other wolves and allowing the sheep population to stabilize, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.41, which is only 2.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for wolf sustenance while ensuring the sheep population has the opportunity to grow. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 1.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their depletion. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their extinction. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a sustainable wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.9% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. A gradual increase in theta will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the survival of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.7% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable for hunting. Maintaining a lower theta allows the sheep to recover while preventing over-competition among wolves. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both populations."
