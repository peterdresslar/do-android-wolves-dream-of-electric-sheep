            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.7% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment helps maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level (14.7% of maximum capacity), allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. However, with the wolf population at 74, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term health of both populations. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to ensure that the sheep can recover without depleting their numbers too quickly, while also allowing for some growth in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 6.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that they need time to recover. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to rebound while still competing with other wolves. This moderate approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.86, which is only 3.6% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting sheep. This lower theta will help balance the populations and promote long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.41, which is only 2.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for some hunting without overexploiting the sheep, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low at 0.13. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low at 0.11. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both species by preventing further depletion of the sheep population while still allowing for some competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and my previous theta was already on the lower end. By slightly increasing it, I can begin to focus more on hunting while still allowing the sheep population a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a balance and responding to the current state of the ecosystem."
