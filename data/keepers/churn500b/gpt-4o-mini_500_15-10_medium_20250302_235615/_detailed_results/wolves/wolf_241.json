            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 26.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with a relatively high sheep-to-wolf ratio of 19.04, I need to be cautious about increasing hunting intensity too quickly. A gradual increase in theta allows for some hunting while still enabling the sheep population to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 27.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with a wolf population of 23, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both populations can thrive. A moderate increase in theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support the wolf population without risking the depletion of sheep. A gradual increase from my previous theta aligns with the wisdom of maintaining balance and responding to current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sustainable coexistence. A moderate increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach as the sheep population is recovering.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and while it is important to maintain a healthy wolf population, I need to allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help ensure that both populations can stabilize and thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 63.41, which is only 6.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.4 to 0.35, I can still focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep to recover. This lower theta will help balance the ecosystem and prevent a crash."
