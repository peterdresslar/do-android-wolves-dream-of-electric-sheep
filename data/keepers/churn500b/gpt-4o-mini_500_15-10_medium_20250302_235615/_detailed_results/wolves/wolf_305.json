            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.3% of maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are more sheep available relative to wolves. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, enabling sustainable coexistence while still allowing for some hunting to support wolf reproduction. This gradual adjustment helps prevent over-depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 63.41, which is only 6.3% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting sheep. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the long-term balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 1.5% of its maximum capacity. With the wolf population being relatively high, it is crucial to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both species by promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a significant competition for resources among wolves. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This small adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to replenish while also managing competition with other wolves. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both species.",
