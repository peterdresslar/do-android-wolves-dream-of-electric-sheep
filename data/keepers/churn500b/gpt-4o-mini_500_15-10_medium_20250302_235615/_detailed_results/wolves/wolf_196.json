            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 109\n- Sheep population: 4.59\n- Wolf population: 35.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.250\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.13 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 0.5% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. It reflects a balanced approach to coexistence, considering both the current state and the trends in the populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 62.70, which is only 6.3% of its maximum capacity. While my previous theta of 0.750 allowed for some hunting, it is important to reduce the intensity slightly to allow the sheep population to recover. A theta of 0.60 strikes a balance between hunting and allowing the sheep to increase, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.86, which is only 3.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover, and a moderate hunting intensity will allow for some hunting while also giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers. By maintaining a balance, I can ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.41, which is only 2.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, reducing hunting intensity slightly to promote sheep recovery while still competing with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. A gradual decrease in theta will help balance the ecosystem without causing sudden crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover. A gradual increase in theta will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.7% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable for hunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a bit more hunting to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep further. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance and allows the sheep population a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. With a high wolf population of 64, focusing on competition among wolves rather than intense hunting will allow the sheep to regain their numbers, ensuring long-term survival for both species. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",

To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. This gradual approach will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that aggressive hunting could lead to a further decline in sheep numbers, jeopardizing the long-term survival of both species. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population, which is essential for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem."
