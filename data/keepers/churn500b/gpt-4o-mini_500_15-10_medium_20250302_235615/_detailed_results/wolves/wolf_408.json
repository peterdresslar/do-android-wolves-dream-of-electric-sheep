            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 167\n- Sheep population: 63.41\n- Wolf population: 192.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.170\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.33 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 6.3% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 63.41, which is only 6.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting a lower theta, I can focus more on competing with other wolves to stabilize our population while allowing the sheep to gradually increase. This approach aligns with the wisdom of making small adjustments and maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the wolf population is relatively high. A theta of 0.30 allows me to focus on competing with other wolves, which will help stabilize our numbers while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 5.70, which is just 0.6% of its maximum capacity. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover while also preventing overcompetition among wolves. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.3% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both species by preventing further depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 2.06, which is just 0.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their extinction. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.20 to 0.25, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.27, which is far below sustainable levels. To allow the sheep to recover, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting. This lower theta will help ensure that the sheep can gradually increase in number, allowing for a healthier ecosystem in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity, which necessitates a cautious approach to allow for recovery. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.20 to 0.25, I can still focus on competition with other wolves while allowing the sheep population a chance to stabilize without depleting them further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta will help balance the competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to rebound.",

To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain balance and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.79, which is only 0.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.30 represents a moderate approach, balancing the need to compete with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers. This strategy aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity. While I need to focus on competing with other wolves to ensure our population remains stable, I also recognize the importance of allowing the sheep to recover. A slight increase in hunting intensity to 0.35 allows for some sustainable hunting while still prioritizing the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to replenish their numbers while also managing competition with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover.
