            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.5% of its maximum capacity, and my previous theta was quite low. To allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a focus on competition with other wolves, a slight increase to 0.25 will help balance the needs of both populations without risking a sudden depletion of sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.7% of its maximum capacity, and my previous theta was already low at 0.25. To allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a focus on competition with other wolves, a slight increase to 0.30 will help balance the needs of both populations without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 178, which is a healthy number, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf reproduction and sheep sustainability. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio, a moderate increase to 0.40 will support our pack while still allowing the sheep population to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment reflects a balance between ensuring wolf reproduction and allowing the sheep population to recover, as we have room to grow without overexploiting our prey.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining balance and responding to current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This approach balances our needs with the ecosystem",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 17.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. By adopting a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery. A gradual approach ensures we maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep. This adjustment reflects the need to respond to the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the overall health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 6.3% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta value will help balance hunting and competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.86, which is only 3.6% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting."
