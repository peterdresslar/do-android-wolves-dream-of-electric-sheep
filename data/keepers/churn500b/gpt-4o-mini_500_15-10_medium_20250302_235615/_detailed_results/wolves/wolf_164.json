            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting approach. This will help maintain the balance between the wolf and sheep populations while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep. A slight reduction from my previous theta reflects the need to adapt to the growing wolf population and ensure long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.6% of maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is slightly above 1. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight decrease in theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring that both populations can recover and thrive without leading to a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 62.70, which is only 6.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own wolf population. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, ensuring both species can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.86, which is only 3.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while allowing the sheep population to gradually increase.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.41, which is only 2.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach, enabling some hunting while still prioritizing the sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure and give the sheep a chance to rebound, while still allowing for some competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the wolf population is relatively high. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of sustainable coexistence and avoids depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 0.7% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. Maintaining a lower theta allows for a focus on competition with other wolves, which can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem."
