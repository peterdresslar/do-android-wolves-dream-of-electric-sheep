            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.0% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still focusing on competition with other wolves. This moderate adjustment helps ensure the sheep can recover while maintaining a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.7% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a slight imbalance favoring the wolves. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while still competing with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 62.70, which is only 6.3% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting. This will help balance the populations and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.86, which is only 3.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.30 to 0.35, I can still maintain some hunting pressure while prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both populations. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.41, which is only 2.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while maintaining a stable wolf population. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure on the sheep, giving them a chance to increase their numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.56, which is only 1.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.30 to 0.35, I can still maintain a focus on competition with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize.
