            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual approach is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 19.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 33.00, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure our long-term survival. A moderate theta of 0.55 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",

This approach balances the need for food with the necessity of maintaining a healthy ecosystem, avoiding overhunting while still allowing for some growth in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 62.70, which is only 6.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity and give the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, while also managing competition among wolves.",
