            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively low at 16.3% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help sustain our wolf population while still allowing sheep to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 63.41, which is only 6.3% of its maximum capacity. While I want to increase my hunting intensity to ensure the survival of my pack, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A moderate increase to 0.70 allows for some hunting while still considering the long-term sustainability of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is quite high. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain its health. This balance is crucial for long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 0.6% of its maximum capacity, which indicates a need for recovery. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to replenish their numbers while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their extinction. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can help the sheep recover while ensuring the long-term survival of both species. This gradual adjustment allows for a more sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. A gradual approach will help maintain balance in the ecosystem."
