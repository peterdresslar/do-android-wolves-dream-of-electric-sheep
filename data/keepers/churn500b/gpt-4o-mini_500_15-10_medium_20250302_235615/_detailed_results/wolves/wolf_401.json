            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 167\n- Sheep population: 63.41\n- Wolf population: 192.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.690\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.33 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 6.3% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 63.41, which is only 6.3% of its maximum capacity. While I need to maintain a balance to ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, a moderate hunting intensity will allow for some hunting while still giving the sheep a chance to recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of making gradual adjustments based on current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is quite high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help create a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent further depletion of sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and my previous focus on hunting has contributed to their decline. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also reducing competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity. With the current sheep-to-wolf ratio being extremely low, it is essential to focus on allowing the sheep to recover rather than intensifying hunting. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and give the sheep a chance to rebound, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. Focusing on competition with other wolves rather than hunting will allow the sheep population to recover, ensuring long-term survival for both species. A gradual approach is essential to avoid sudden crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity, and my previous theta was too aggressive for the current state. A slight increase from 0.20 to 0.25 allows for a more cautious approach that prioritizes the recovery of the sheep while still enabling some hunting to maintain my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that aggressive hunting could lead to a further decline in sheep, jeopardizing the long-term survival of both species. By setting theta at 0.30, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity. Maintaining a low hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover and prevent further depletion. Given the current wolf population, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their extinction. Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover while also keeping the wolf population stable. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This approach supports the long-term survival of both species and prevents a collapse of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and my previous theta was already on the lower end. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for a modest increase in hunting intensity, which can help sustain my pack while still giving the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to replenish their numbers while also managing competition with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for a sustainable balance.",
