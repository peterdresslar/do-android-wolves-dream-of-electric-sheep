            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively low at 16.3% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain our wolf population while still considering the need for sheep recovery. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 63.41, which is only 6.3% of its maximum capacity. While I need to maintain a balance, I can afford to increase my hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction. However, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly, so a moderate increase to 0.60 allows for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help create a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By focusing more on competition with other wolves rather than hunting, I can help the sheep population stabilize and eventually grow, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 3.12, which is just 0.3% of its maximum capacity. Given the high wolf population of 154, it is crucial to focus on reducing competition among wolves rather than intensifying hunting. This will allow the sheep population to recover and ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 2.06, which is just 0.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that aggressive hunting could lead to the extinction of sheep, jeopardizing the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This way, I can maintain a balance and ensure sustainable cycles.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover rather than intensifying hunting. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and give the sheep a chance to rebound.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting would further threaten their survival. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.20 to 0.25, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to gradually increase their numbers while still competing with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for long-term sustainability."
