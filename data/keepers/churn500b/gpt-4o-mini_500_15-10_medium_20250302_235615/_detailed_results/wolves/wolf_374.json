            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 63.41, which is only 6.3% of its maximum capacity. While my previous theta of 0.679 indicates a more aggressive hunting strategy, it is essential to moderate my approach to allow the sheep population to recover. A theta of 0.55 strikes a balance between hunting and allowing for sustainable coexistence, considering the current dynamics of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.71, which is only 1.5% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.40 allows for some hunting without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 5.70, which is only 0.6% of its maximum capacity. Given the high wolf population of 179, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help balance competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to rebound.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. A gradual approach will help maintain balance and prevent a crash in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to recover. This approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep while maintaining a balance in the ecosystem. Gradually increasing my theta is essential as the sheep population improves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution in hunting. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.20 to 0.25, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.97, which is only 0.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.30 represents a moderate approach, balancing the need to compete with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers. This aligns with the wisdom of making gradual adjustments to ensure long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting would further deplete their numbers and jeopardize the long-term survival of both species.
