            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 167\n- Sheep population: 63.41\n- Wolf population: 192.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.808\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.33 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 6.3% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

While I need to maintain a balance to ensure the wolf population does not grow too quickly, a moderate increase in hunting intensity will allow for some recovery of the sheep population while still supporting wolf reproduction. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 14.71, which is only 1.5% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. This will help balance the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population, which is crucial for the sustainability of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 5.70, which is only 0.6% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting. This lower theta will help balance the populations and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.3% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a severe depletion of prey. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity. Increasing hunting intensity at this stage could lead to the collapse of the sheep population, which would ultimately harm the wolf population as well. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a more balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still considering the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.2% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A gradual decrease in hunting intensity will help create a more sustainable balance.",

By slightly increasing my theta from 0.20 to 0.25, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity. Increasing hunting intensity could lead to the extinction of sheep, which would ultimately harm the wolf population as well. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population a chance to recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to replenish while still competing with other wolves. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their depletion and jeopardize the long-term survival of both species. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help the sheep population stabilize and gradually increase, ensuring long-term survival for both species. This approach aligns with the wisdom of making small adjustments and responding to the current state of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.71, which is only 0.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are in a vulnerable state, and focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to recover while preventing overhunting. A gradual increase in theta is necessary to ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and my previous theta was focused on competition rather than hunting. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for a modest increase in hunting intensity, which can help the wolf population recover while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep further. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",

This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are in a vulnerable state, and while I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must prioritize the recovery of the sheep. A slight increase in theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring a gradual balance is maintained.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By focusing on competition with other wolves instead, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.79, which is only 0.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should remain low to allow the sheep to recover. However, I can slightly increase my theta from 0.30 to 0.35 to adapt to the current conditions and ensure that the wolf population remains healthy without depleting the sheep further."
