            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.7% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a healthy number of sheep per wolf. By lowering my hunting intensity slightly, I can allow the sheep population to recover while still competing with other wolves. This approach aligns with my goal of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.6% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a balance as the sheep population recovers while also supporting the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 62.70, which is only 6.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By adopting a lower theta, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.86, which is only 3.6% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity and promote a more sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.41, which is only 2.2% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the survival of my pack, I also recognize the importance of allowing the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low at 0.13. This indicates a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep population to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to repopulate while also managing competition with other wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a significant competition for resources. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of my ancestors, promoting a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 0.7% of its maximum capacity. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover and increases the chances of sustainable coexistence. Additionally, with a wolf population of 73, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. This indicates that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow the sheep population to recover while still ensuring the wolf population can sustain itself. A slight increase from my previous theta will help balance the need for hunting with the necessity of allowing sheep to rebound.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain balance and prevent overhunting."
