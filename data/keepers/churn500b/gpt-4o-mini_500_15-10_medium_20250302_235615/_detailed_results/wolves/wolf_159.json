            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term survival of both species. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance as the sheep recover, while also considering the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 62.70, which is only 6.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to stabilize while still competing with other wolves. This moderate approach aligns with my goal of ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.86, which is only 3.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.30 reflects a focus on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, promoting a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.41 and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low at 0.19. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be slightly increased to support wolf reproduction, it is crucial to avoid overhunting to allow the sheep population to recover. A gradual increase to 0.35 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. Focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to recover while preventing overhunting and ensuring the long-term survival of both species. A gradual approach is essential to avoid sudden population crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.9% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. This suggests that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.30 reflects a cautious approach, focusing more on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.7% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable for hunting. A slight increase from my previous theta will allow for a modest increase in hunting intensity, which can help support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem."
