This lower theta will help balance the ecosystem while still keeping an eye on the wolf population.",

A gradual decrease in theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.1% of its maximum capacity, which necessitates a cautious approach to hunting. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.20 to 0.25, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their extinction. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and my previous theta of 0.3 was already focused on competition with other wolves. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I will gradually increase my hunting intensity to 0.35, allowing for a slight increase in hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This small adjustment helps maintain balance without risking a crash."
