            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that can help sustain both populations. This value reflects a balanced approach, enabling us to hunt enough to support our pack while allowing the sheep to recover and maintain their numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 6.3% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining some hunting to support our pack. A moderate theta value will help achieve a balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.86, which is only 3.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while allowing the sheep population to stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.41, which is only 2.2% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a bit more hunting to support reproduction while still prioritizing the sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population, which would ultimately harm the wolf population as well.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 1.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their extinction. By focusing on competition with other wolves and reducing hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.9% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. This suggests that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. A moderate theta of 0.30 will help balance the need for wolf survival while giving sheep a chance to increase their numbers, ensuring long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 7.06, which is only 0.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should remain low to allow the sheep to recover. However, with a slight increase to 0.35, I can still maintain some hunting to support the wolf population without risking a further decline in sheep numbers. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to rebound while also managing competition with other wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
