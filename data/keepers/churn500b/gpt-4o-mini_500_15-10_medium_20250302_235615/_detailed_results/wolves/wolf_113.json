            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity. This will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term survival for both. Gradually increasing my hunting intensity is prudent as the sheep population is still below maximum capacity, but I must be cautious not to deplete their numbers too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that promotes sustainability. With the sheep-to-wolf ratio being relatively high, I can afford to focus on maintaining a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves. This adjustment will help ensure the long-term survival of both species while allowing for gradual population recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 19.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a more cautious approach, focusing on maintaining a balance as the wolf population is relatively stable. This adjustment will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual increase is prudent to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting approach. This will help maintain the balance between the wolf and sheep populations while also considering the gradual increase in wolf numbers. A slight reduction from my previous theta will allow for competition among wolves without overly depleting the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 62.70, which is only 6.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover, and a lower hunting intensity will allow for their population to stabilize. Additionally, with the wolf population at 123, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.86, which is only 3.6% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure long-term sustainability, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting. This will help balance the ecosystem and prevent a crash in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.41, which is only 2.2% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will enable me to maintain some hunting intensity while still focusing on the competition among wolves. This approach promotes a sustainable balance as I monitor the trends in both populations."
