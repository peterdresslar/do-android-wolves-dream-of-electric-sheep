            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term survival of both species. This moderate adjustment will help maintain balance as the wolf population is relatively low, and I want to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 19.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with a wolf population of 21, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to maintain our numbers. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on the long-term balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain our wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid over-depletion of the sheep and to foster a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low percentage of its maximum capacity, allowing for some increased hunting without risking depletion. However, with the wolf population at a moderate level, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.7% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep. This moderate approach helps maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can continue to recover. A gradual increase is necessary to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly, and it aligns with the wisdom of adapting to the current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 62.70, which is only 6.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to stabilize while still competing with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.86, which is only 3.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep while maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.41, which is only 2.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is potential for recovery if I reduce hunting intensity slightly. By increasing theta only modestly, I can still focus on competition with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow.
