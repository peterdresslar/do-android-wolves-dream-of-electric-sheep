            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 10.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population also being relatively high, a moderate approach will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep too quickly. This allows for gradual adjustments as conditions change.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 6.3% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to sustain itself. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 3.6% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta value will help balance hunting and competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.41, which is only 2.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help create a sustainable balance without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and my previous theta was already on the lower end. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach, enabling me to hunt a bit more while still being cautious about the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population, which is essential for the future of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and my focus should be on allowing them to recover. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both sheep and wolves, while also allowing for a gradual increase in the sheep population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.7% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta will help balance hunting with the need for sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is very low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a significant competition for resources among wolves. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a bit more hunting to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. This approach aims to maintain a balance that can sustain both populations over time.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem."
