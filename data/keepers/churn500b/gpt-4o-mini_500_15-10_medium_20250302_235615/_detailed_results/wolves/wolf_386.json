            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 63.41, which is only 6.3% of its maximum capacity. While I need to maintain a balance to ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, a moderate increase in hunting intensity is warranted to support wolf reproduction. However, I must be cautious not to overhunt, as the sheep population needs time to recover. A theta of 0.65 allows for a sustainable approach that acknowledges the current low sheep numbers while still promoting wolf health.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus more on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting. This will allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a healthy balance within the wolf pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 5.70, which is only 0.6% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable balance, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting intensely. This lower theta will help the sheep population stabilize while also allowing for gradual adjustments in the future as conditions change.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.3% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. This lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a collapse.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their collapse. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring that both populations can stabilize and recover over time.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. A gradual approach is essential to avoid sudden crashes in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution. While I want to ensure the survival of my pack, I must prioritize the recovery of the sheep population to maintain a sustainable ecosystem. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves to ensure our long-term survival.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.79, which is only 0.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are in a vulnerable state, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to their further decline. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and my previous theta was focused on competition rather than hunting. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach, enabling me to gradually increase hunting intensity while still allowing the sheep population to recover. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem."
