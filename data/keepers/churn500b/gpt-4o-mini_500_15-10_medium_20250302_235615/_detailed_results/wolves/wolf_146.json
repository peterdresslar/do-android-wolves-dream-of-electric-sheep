            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that can support wolf reproduction while preventing over-depletion of the sheep. This balance will help maintain both populations in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low percentage of its maximum capacity, allowing for some increased hunting without risking depletion. However, with the wolf population also being significant, a moderate approach will help maintain balance and prevent overexploitation of the sheep. This gradual adjustment will support both populations sustainably.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are slightly more sheep than wolves. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while still competing with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 6.3% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain balance and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is quite low at 3.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution in hunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a more balanced approach, promoting the recovery of sheep while still enabling some hunting to support the wolf population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.41, which is only 2.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while maintaining a stable wolf population. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure and promote a healthier ecosystem balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 1.5% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure long-term sustainability, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting. This lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity further to allow the sheep population to recover. This will help create a more sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and my previous theta was too focused on hunting. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity, I can help the wolf population recover while still allowing the sheep to gradually increase. This small adjustment aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence."
