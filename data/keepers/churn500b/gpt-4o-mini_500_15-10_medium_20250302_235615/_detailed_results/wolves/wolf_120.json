            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 19.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for increased hunting without risking immediate depletion. However, given the current wolf population, I want to avoid over-hunting and ensure sustainable cycles. A moderate increase in hunting intensity allows for better reproduction while still considering the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain our wolf population while still ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 17.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with a relatively high sheep-to-wolf ratio of 3.53, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring that both sheep and wolves can thrive without depleting resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, allowing for some hunting without risking depletion. However, the wolf population is also significant, so a moderate approach will help maintain balance and avoid overexploitation of the sheep. This theta allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are slightly more sheep than wolves. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still competing with other wolves. A moderate decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance and avoid depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 62.70, which is only 6.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves and allow the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.86, which is only 3.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is an opportunity to increase hunting intensity slightly to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A gradual increase to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of the wolf pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.41, which is only 2.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while ensuring the sheep population has the opportunity to grow, promoting long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and my previous theta of 0.3 was focused on competition with other wolves. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I will gradually increase my hunting intensity to 0.35, allowing for a slight increase in sheep hunting while still prioritizing balance and sustainability."
