            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 6.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that a more moderate hunting intensity is necessary to allow for recovery. While the wolf population is relatively high, I want to avoid overhunting and ensure a sustainable balance. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.86, which is only 3.6% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and avoid overhunting, I will focus more on competing with other wolves while still maintaining some hunting activity. This moderate adjustment will help ensure the long-term survival of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 2.2% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.56, which is only 1.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to be cautious with our hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can grow, while still allowing for some hunting to support our own population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a significant imbalance. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.9% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. This gradual approach will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and my previous theta was already on the lower end. By slightly increasing it, I can begin to focus on hunting while still allowing the sheep population to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. This lower theta value will help ensure the long-term survival of both species by preventing overhunting and allowing for a more sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A gradual increase in theta to 0.30 allows for some hunting without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 4.89, which is just 0.5% of its maximum capacity. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover while also preventing overcompetition among wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover while also considering the current high wolf population. This balance is essential for the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and my previous theta was already on the lower end. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for a modest increase in hunting intensity, which can help support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. This approach aligns with the need for a gradual adjustment in response to the current low sheep numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 0.4% of its maximum capacity. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.15, it is crucial to focus on allowing the sheep to recover rather than intensifying hunting. A lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both species by promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable for hunting. Maintaining a lower theta allows the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This approach ensures the long-term survival of both species and avoids depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution in hunting. While I want to ensure the survival of my pack, I must also allow the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term balance of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution in hunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population.
