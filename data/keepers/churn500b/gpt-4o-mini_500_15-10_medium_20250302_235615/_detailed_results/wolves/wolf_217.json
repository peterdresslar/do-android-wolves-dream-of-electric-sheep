This indicates that the sheep need time to recover, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to replenish. Additionally, with a wolf population of 123, focusing on competition among wolves rather than aggressive hunting will help maintain our numbers while ensuring the sheep can bounce back.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.86, which is only 3.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is a need for cautious hunting to allow the sheep to recover while still ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.41, which is only 2.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while maintaining a stable wolf population. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure and promote a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should remain cautious to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep can gradually increase in number, supporting long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. This lower theta will help maintain a balance and prevent a crash in the ecosystem.",

A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance while still allowing for some hunting, as the wolf population is relatively high. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining sustainable cycles.",

To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity and give the sheep a chance to rebound, while also managing competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and my previous theta was already on the lower end. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for a small uptick in hunting intensity, which can help sustain my pack without depleting the sheep population too quickly. This gradual adjustment aligns with the need to balance both wolf and sheep populations effectively.",

A gradual decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a significant competition for resources. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.4% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. This suggests that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover.
