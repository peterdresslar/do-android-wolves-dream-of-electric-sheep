            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 167\n- Sheep population: 63.41\n- Wolf population: 192.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.633\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.33 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 6.3% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 179\n- Sheep population: 0.71\n- Wolf population: 37.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.350\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.02 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 0.1% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 63.41, which is only 6.3% of its maximum capacity. While my previous theta of 0.633 indicates a more aggressive hunting strategy, I need to shift towards a more balanced approach to allow the sheep population to recover. A theta of 0.45 will help maintain a sustainable coexistence while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is quite high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low at 0.03. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. A gradual decrease in theta will help maintain a balance while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.3% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. A gradual approach will help maintain balance in the ecosystem without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By focusing more on competition with other wolves rather than hunting, I can help the sheep population stabilize and allow for future sustainable cycles. This gradual adjustment will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity. Focusing on competition with other wolves rather than hunting will allow the sheep to recover, ensuring the long-term survival of both species. A gradual approach is necessary to avoid further depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and my previous theta was too focused on competition with other wolves. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can help stabilize the sheep population while still being cautious not to overhunt. This gradual adjustment allows for a better balance between the wolf and sheep populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity. It is essential to focus on reducing competition among wolves to allow the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent further depletion of the sheep population, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a presence in the ecosystem. A slight increase from my previous theta will help me balance competition with other wolves while giving sheep a chance to rebound.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.1% of its maximum capacity, and my previous theta was already low. This indicates a need to focus on competition with other wolves rather than hunting sheep to allow the sheep population to recover. A gradual increase to 0.30 reflects a slight shift towards balance while still prioritizing the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity. Maintaining a low hunting intensity is essential to allow the sheep to recover. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need for sustainable coexistence, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.1% of maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution in hunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to replenish their numbers while also managing competition with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and sustainable coexistence."
