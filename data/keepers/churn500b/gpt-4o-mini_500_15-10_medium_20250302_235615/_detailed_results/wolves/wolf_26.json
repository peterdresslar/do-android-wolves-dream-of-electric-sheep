            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.7% of maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are more sheep available relative to wolves. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing competition with other wolves. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 15.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. A moderate increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, enabling us to take advantage of the sheep population while still considering the long-term health of both species. This gradual adjustment helps maintain stability in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still considering the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that we need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while also enabling the sheep to replenish their numbers, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem. This approach will help maintain our wolf population in the long run without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.6% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can recover over time.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 77.70, which is only 7.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and allowing the sheep population to stabilize, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 53.99, which is only 5.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to gradually increase, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 38.10, which is only 3.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.30 to 0.35, I can still focus on competition with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.87, which is only 2.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are struggling, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to their further decline. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.32, which is only 2.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to sustain itself. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a cautious approach to hunting without risking a rapid depletion of the sheep."
