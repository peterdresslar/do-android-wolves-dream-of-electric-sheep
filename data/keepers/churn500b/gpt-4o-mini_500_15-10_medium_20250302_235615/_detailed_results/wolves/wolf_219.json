            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 98\n- Sheep population: 62.70\n- Wolf population: 123.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.474\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.51 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 6.3% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 62.70, which is only 6.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing our own population. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity and promote a more sustainable balance between wolves and sheep, ensuring long-term survival for both.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.86, which is only 3.6% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting sheep. This will help balance the populations and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.41, which is only 2.2% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the survival of my wolf pack, I must also allow the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for some hunting to support reproduction while still prioritizing the sustainability of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves and ensure a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual decrease in theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 0.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, ensuring a more sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 7.06, which is only 0.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting to support the wolf population. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a cautious approach to balance both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By focusing on competing with other wolves instead of hunting, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while maintaining a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 5.26, which is only 0.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are struggling, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to their further decline. By slightly increasing theta to 0.35, I can focus on a balanced approach that allows for some hunting while still giving the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",

Maintaining a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while preventing overcompetition among wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and prioritizes long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and my previous theta was focused on competition rather than hunting. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for a modest increase in hunting intensity, which can help stabilize the wolf population while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep further. This gradual adjustment aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 0.4% of its maximum capacity.

Maintaining a lower theta allows the sheep to recover while also preventing over-competition among wolves, ensuring our long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.5% of its maximum capacity, which indicates that aggressive hunting could lead to their depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a bit more hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can allow the sheep population to stabilize and grow, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 5.30, which is only 0.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity to 0.35, I can still focus on competition with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a balance and responding to the current state of both populations.",
