            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, allowing for some hunting without risking depletion. However, with a relatively high sheep-to-wolf ratio, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure the long-term survival of both species. A moderate approach will help maintain a balance while allowing for gradual adjustments as conditions change.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while giving sheep a chance to recover. This approach helps maintain a balance between both populations and avoids over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively low at 10.6% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly. A gradual increase is essential to avoid sudden crashes in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 7.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that a more cautious approach is needed to allow for recovery. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from the previous theta of 0.4 to 0.35, I can maintain a balance that supports both the wolf population and the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 53.99, which is only 5.4% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting, which could lead to a crash in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 38.10, which is only 3.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a slight hunting intensity. A small increase from my previous theta of 0.30 to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach that supports sustainable coexistence without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.87, which is only 2.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover rather than intensifying our hunting. By maintaining a lower theta, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both our wolf pack and the sheep, while also reducing competition among wolves as we adapt to the current ecosystem state.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.32, which is only 2.1% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will enable me to maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.85, which is only 1.7% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting intensively. This will help maintain the balance and prevent a crash in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and maintaining a low hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while also preventing overcompetition among wolves. A slight increase from my previous theta reflects a cautious approach to adapt to the current state without risking the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 1.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to increase. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid sudden population crashes."
