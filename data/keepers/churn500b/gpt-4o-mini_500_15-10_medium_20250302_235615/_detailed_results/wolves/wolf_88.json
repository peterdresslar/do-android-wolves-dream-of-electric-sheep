            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 77.70, which is only 7.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to rebuild their numbers. Additionally, with a wolf population of 89, focusing on competition among wolves rather than aggressive hunting will help maintain our numbers while ensuring the sheep can thrive in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 53.99, which is only 5.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are in a vulnerable state, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to their depletion. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 38.10, which is only 3.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.30 to 0.35, I can still focus on competition with other wolves while allowing for some sustainable hunting. This gradual adjustment helps maintain a balance between the wolf and sheep populations without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.87, which is only 2.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. Maintaining a lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both species and prevent overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I need to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.85, which is only 1.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to gradually increase while ensuring the wolf population remains stable.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.95, which is only 1.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a slight hunting intensity to support our own population. A small increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach that considers both the immediate needs of the wolf pack and the long-term sustainability of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 12, which is only 1.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population, which is crucial for the sustainability of our pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help create a sustainable balance without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 1.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to replenish while also managing competition with other wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity further to allow the sheep population to recover. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should remain cautious to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition among wolves, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.09, which is only 0.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should be cautious with our hunting to allow the sheep to recover. However, with a wolf population of 31, we need to ensure that we maintain our numbers as well. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.00, which is only 0.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.03, which is only 0.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable, and while I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must prioritize the recovery of the sheep. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.9% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help create a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A gradual increase allows for a more sustainable balance as the sheep population recovers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are not enough sheep to sustain aggressive hunting. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a healthy balance in the wolf population."
