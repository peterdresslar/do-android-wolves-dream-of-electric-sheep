A gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining balance and responding to population trends.",

This value reflects a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring that we do not deplete the sheep too quickly while still allowing for some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 6.3% of maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta value will help balance hunting and competition with other wolves.",

To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting intensively. This will help balance the populations and avoid depleting the sheep further.",
