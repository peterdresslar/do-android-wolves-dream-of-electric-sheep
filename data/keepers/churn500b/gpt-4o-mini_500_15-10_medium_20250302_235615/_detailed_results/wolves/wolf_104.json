            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 86\n- Sheep population: 121.48\n- Wolf population: 3.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.215\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 40.49 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 12.1% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.1% of maximum capacity, and my previous theta was quite low. This adjustment allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. It strikes a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 132.09, which is only 13.2% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A moderate increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.3% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.5% of its maximum capacity, which suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. This approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, as well as prevent overexploitation of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.7% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can continue to thrive. A gradual increase aligns with the wisdom of adapting to population trends without risking a sudden depletion of resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while preventing over-depletion of the sheep. This balance will help maintain both populations in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 19.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with a wolf population of 33.00, I need to be cautious about over-hunting. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, enabling sustainable coexistence while still allowing for some hunting to support our wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 17.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with a wolf population of 50, I need to be cautious about overhunting. A slight decrease in hunting intensity allows for a sustainable balance while still enabling the wolf population to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, allowing for some increased hunting without risking their long-term survival. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance between wolf reproduction and sheep recovery, while still being cautious to avoid overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a slight overpopulation of wolves. A moderate decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to thrive. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 6.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that a more conservative approach is needed to allow for recovery. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from the previous theta of 0.40 to 0.35, I can still maintain a focus on competition with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.86, which is only 3.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem."
