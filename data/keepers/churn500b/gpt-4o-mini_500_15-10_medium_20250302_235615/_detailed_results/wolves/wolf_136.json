            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.7% of maximum capacity, and my previous theta was quite low at 0.114. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I will gradually increase my hunting intensity to a moderate level. This will allow for a balanced approach that supports wolf reproduction while giving sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.7% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term survival of both species. This small adjustment from my previous theta will help maintain a balance as the sheep population recovers, while also considering the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.6% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 62.70, which is only 6.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing competition with other wolves, which is crucial given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.51. This approach helps to create a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.86, which is only 3.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A lower theta value will help maintain the balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can grow, promoting long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.41, which is only 2.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to sustain itself. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a cautious approach to hunting, balancing the need for food with the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity and give the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, while also allowing the wolf population to stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem."
