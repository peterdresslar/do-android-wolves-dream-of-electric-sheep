            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is quite low at 6.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their depletion. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, enabling the sheep to recover while still supporting the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. This lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and promote a healthier balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while preventing overcompetition among wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.3% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. A gradual adjustment to 0.25 will help maintain a balance while competing with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and avoid depleting their numbers further, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting. This will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a focus on competition with other wolves while still being cautious about hunting intensity, which will help the sheep population recover over time. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. A gradual adjustment to 0.20 will help maintain a balance while still considering the competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity further to allow the sheep population to recover. A gradual increase in theta will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.97, which is only 0.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are in a vulnerable state, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to recover. By maintaining a focus on competition with other wolves rather than aggressive hunting, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while gradually allowing the sheep population to bounce back."
