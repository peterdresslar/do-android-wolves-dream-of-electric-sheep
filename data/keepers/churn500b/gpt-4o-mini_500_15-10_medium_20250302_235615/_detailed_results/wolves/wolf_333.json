            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain our wolf population while still ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A moderate adjustment keeps us responsive to the ecosystem",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 63.41, which is only 6.3% of its maximum capacity. While my previous theta of 0.700 was effective for reproduction, it risks depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.50 allows for a balanced approach, enabling some hunting while also giving the sheep a chance to recover. This strategy supports the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing the wolf numbers sustainably. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 5.70, which is just 0.6% of its maximum capacity. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover and increases the chances of sustainable coexistence. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.03, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 3.12, which is just 0.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting sheep. This will allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a balance in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity. Increasing hunting intensity could lead to their extinction, which would ultimately harm the wolf population as well. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a more balanced approach, giving sheep a chance to recover while still considering the needs of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting sheep. This will allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a healthy balance in the ecosystem.",
