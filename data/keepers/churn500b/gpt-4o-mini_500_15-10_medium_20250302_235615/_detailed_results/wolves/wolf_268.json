            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help support wolf reproduction while still ensuring that the sheep population can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is key to maintaining balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, I must remain cautious and avoid overhunting, as the wolf population is also present and could grow if I reduce hunting pressure slightly. This adjustment aims to maintain a sustainable balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 16.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 132, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting, which could lead to a crash in the sheep population. A moderate theta of 0.60 allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still considering the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 63.41, which is only 6.3% of its maximum capacity. While I need to maintain a healthy wolf population, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population. This lower theta value will help create a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 5.70, which is only 0.6% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash."
