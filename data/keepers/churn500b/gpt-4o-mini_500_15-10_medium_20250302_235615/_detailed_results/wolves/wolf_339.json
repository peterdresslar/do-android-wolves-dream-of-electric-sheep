            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 16.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population also being significant, a moderate approach will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep too quickly. This allows for gradual adjustments as conditions change.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 63.41, which is only 6.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting theta at 0.40, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to gradually increase, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 5.70, which is just 0.6% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus more on reducing competition with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.3% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we are overhunting. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution in hunting. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.20 to 0.25, I can focus more on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. This lower theta will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem and prevent a crash in sheep numbers, which would ultimately harm the wolf population as well.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting would further deplete their numbers and jeopardize future food sources. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep."
