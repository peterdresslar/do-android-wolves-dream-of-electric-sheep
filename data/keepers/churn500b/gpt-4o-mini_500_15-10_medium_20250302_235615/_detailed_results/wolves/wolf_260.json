            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 27.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 6.28, it is essential to focus on competition with other wolves to stabilize our population before increasing hunting intensity. A gradual increase in theta allows for a sustainable approach while ensuring that both populations can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 23.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. A moderate increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level (16.3% of maximum capacity), allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking immediate depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring both can thrive in the long term. A gradual increase is prudent as it aligns with the wisdom of adapting to population changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 63.41, which is only 6.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 reflects a balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain balance and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. This gradual approach will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem."
