            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level (16.3% of maximum capacity), allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover over time.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 63.41, which is only 6.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. A moderate theta of 0.40 strikes a balance between competing with other wolves and allowing the sheep to increase in number, promoting a sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is very low, at only 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover, and focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep population to gradually increase. A lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both species by avoiding overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 3.12, which is just 0.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity, and my previous theta was too focused on hunting. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity, I can help ensure the survival of my pack while still allowing the sheep population a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. Focusing on competition with other wolves rather than hunting sheep will allow the sheep population to recover, ensuring long-term survival for both species. A gradual approach is necessary to avoid depleting the sheep further."
