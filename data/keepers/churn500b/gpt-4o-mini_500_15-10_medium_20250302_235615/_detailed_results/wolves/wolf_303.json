            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 23.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with a wolf population of 76, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure long-term survival. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance while allowing for some recovery of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 16.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. A moderate increase from my previous theta allows for a balance between hunting and ensuring the sheep can recover, while also considering the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 6.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while still competing with other wolves. This moderate theta value allows for a balanced approach that promotes sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can allow the sheep population to recover while ensuring the long-term survival of both species. This gradual approach will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. A gradual decrease in theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 3.12, which is just 0.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. This lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population, which is essential for the future of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 2.06, which is just 0.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.20 allows for a small adjustment in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term survival of both species. It is essential to avoid overhunting at this stage to prevent a collapse of the sheep population."
