            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for increased hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover over time.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain our wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.6% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking over-depletion. This value balances the need for wolf reproduction with the sustainability of the sheep population, ensuring both can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 62.70, which is only 6.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.45 strikes a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring that both populations can stabilize and thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.86, which is only 3.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep to gradually increase in number while maintaining a sustainable wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.41, which is only 2.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while maintaining a stable wolf population. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure and promote a healthier ecosystem balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and my previous theta was on the lower end. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for a modest increase in hunting intensity, which can help sustain my pack while still giving the sheep a chance to recover. This adjustment aligns with the need for a balanced approach, considering both the current low sheep population and the growing wolf numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure and give the sheep a chance to rebound, while also addressing the competition among wolves."
