            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help ensure the wolf population remains healthy while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual adjustment is key to maintaining balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, I must remain cautious and avoid overhunting, as the wolf population is also growing. A moderate adjustment will help maintain balance and ensure both populations can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is necessary to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly, and this balance will support long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 63.41, which is only 6.3% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.45 strikes a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help create a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while preventing overcompetition among wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and sustainable coexistence."
