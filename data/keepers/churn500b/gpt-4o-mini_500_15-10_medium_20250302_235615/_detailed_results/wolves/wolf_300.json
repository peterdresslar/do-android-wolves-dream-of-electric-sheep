            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 23.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 3.15, it is essential to focus on competition with other wolves to ensure our population remains stable. A gradual increase in theta will allow for a sustainable balance while giving sheep time to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.3% of maximum capacity, and my previous theta was quite low at 0.25. A small increase to 0.30 allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach helps maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 63.41, which is only 6.3% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will enable me to hunt more effectively while still prioritizing the sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allow the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 0.6% of its maximum capacity. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover and increases their population, which is crucial for the long-term survival of both species. Additionally, with a high wolf population, focusing on competition rather than hunting will help stabilize our numbers without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 3.12, which is just 0.3% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting. This lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and give the sheep a chance to increase their numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity. To allow for recovery and ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and competing with other wolves instead. This will help the sheep population stabilize and eventually grow, creating a more sustainable ecosystem."
