            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep do not become overly depleted. A gradual adjustment is key to balancing our needs with the health of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help ensure the wolf population remains healthy while still allowing the sheep to recover and thrive. A gradual increase in theta will support our long-term survival without risking a depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 6.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without risking depletion. A moderate hunting intensity allows for a balance between maintaining our wolf population and giving the sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.86, which is only 3.6% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. This will help balance the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population, while also allowing for some wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.41, which is only 2.2% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we are at risk of depleting their numbers further. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing competition among wolves. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.7% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help balance the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
