            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 23.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for increased hunting without risking depletion. However, with a wolf population of 76, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting, so a moderate increase to 0.75 allows for sustainable coexistence while still promoting wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 16.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for increased hunting without risking immediate depletion. However, with the wolf population at 132, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 63.41, which is only 6.3% of its maximum capacity. While my previous theta of 0.650 allowed for some hunting, it is crucial to focus on the long-term sustainability of both sheep and wolves. A moderate theta of 0.40 will help balance the need for hunting with the necessity of allowing the sheep population to recover, while also considering the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 1.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover and increase in number, rather than intensifying hunting. A lower theta will help reduce competition among wolves and give the sheep a chance to rebound, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 5.70, which is just 0.6% of its maximum capacity. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover and stabilize, ensuring the long-term survival of both species. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.03, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 3.12, which is just 0.3% of its maximum capacity. Focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to recover while preventing further depletion of their numbers. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and prioritizes long-term survival for both species."
