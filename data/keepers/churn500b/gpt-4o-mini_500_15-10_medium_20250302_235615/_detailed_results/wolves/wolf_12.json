            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 40\n- Sheep population: 27.87\n- Wolf population: 93.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.350\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.30 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 2.8% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 130.04, which is only 13.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will allow for a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep can recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.0% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover and thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still maintaining a sustainable balance with the sheep population. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio, a moderate increase in theta will help ensure both populations can thrive without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while I want to ensure my pack thrives, I also recognize the importance of allowing the sheep to recover. A moderate approach will help maintain balance while avoiding overhunting, which could lead to future scarcity.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while I want to ensure the wolves can thrive, I need to be cautious about overhunting. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, enabling the sheep to recover while still providing for the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.0% of maximum capacity, indicating that a more cautious approach is needed to allow for recovery. While the sheep-to-wolf ratio suggests there are enough sheep to support some hunting, I want to avoid depleting their numbers further. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, allowing both populations to stabilize and thrive in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.6% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing sheep to recover. A gradual increase is essential to avoid sudden population crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 77.70, which is only 7.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to gradually increase while maintaining a stable wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 53.99, which is only 5.4% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 38.10, which is only 3.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.87, which is only 2.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to gradually increase while ensuring our own survival. This approach aligns with the wisdom of making small adjustments and responding to the current state of the ecosystem."
