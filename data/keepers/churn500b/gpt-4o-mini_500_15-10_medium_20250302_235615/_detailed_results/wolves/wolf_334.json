            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.3% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 63.41, which is only 6.3% of its maximum capacity. While I need to maintain hunting to support the wolf population, I must also be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while still enabling the sheep to recover, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 14.71, which is only 1.5% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can help create a more sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. Maintaining a lower theta allows the sheep to recover while minimizing competition among wolves. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 3.12, which is just 0.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 2.06, which is just 0.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain balance and prevent further depletion of the sheep, which is essential for our ecosystem",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and my previous focus on competition has not allowed for any recovery. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help sustain my pack while still allowing the sheep population to recover gradually.
