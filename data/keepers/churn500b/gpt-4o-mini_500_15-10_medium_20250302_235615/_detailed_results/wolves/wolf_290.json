            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 23.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for increased hunting without risking immediate depletion. However, I want to avoid a drastic increase from my previous theta of 0.944 to maintain a sustainable balance. A slight reduction to 0.85 allows for continued hunting while also considering the need to adapt to the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for some hunting without risking depletion. A slight reduction from my previous theta will help maintain balance as the wolf population grows, ensuring both species can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 63.41, which is only 6.3% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I also recognize the importance of allowing the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.60 allows for some hunting to support reproduction while not over-depleting the sheep, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 5.70, which is only 0.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should remain low to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a cautious approach to hunting while still prioritizing the long-term survival of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. This lower theta will help maintain a balance and prevent a crash in the ecosystem."
