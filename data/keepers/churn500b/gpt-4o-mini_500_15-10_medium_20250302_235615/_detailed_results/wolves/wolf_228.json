            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.86, which is only 3.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are in a vulnerable state, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to their rapid depletion. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.41, which is only 2.2% of its maximum capacity. While I need to focus on hunting to ensure the survival of my pack, I must also be cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of sheep and maintaining a balance with the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 1.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to rebound. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. A gradual decrease in hunting will help maintain a balance and prevent a crash in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 8.54, which is only 0.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should remain cautious to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta will help balance the need for wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the sustainability of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 5.93, which is only 0.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. Additionally, with a wolf population of 64, focusing on competition among wolves rather than aggressive hunting will help maintain our numbers while giving the sheep a chance to rebound.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable for hunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a more balanced approach, enabling some hunting while still allowing the sheep population to recover. This gradual adjustment helps ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to replenish while also considering the growing wolf population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover and ensures the long-term survival of both species. Given the current high wolf population, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and my previous theta was already on the lower end. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for a modest increase in hunting intensity, which can help support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep further. This adjustment aligns with the need for a balanced approach to ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 0.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are under significant pressure, and focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while allowing the sheep population to stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. Maintaining a lower theta allows the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a slight hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A gradual increase from my previous theta will help balance the needs of both species without risking a crash.",
