While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I also want to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 53.99, which is only 5.4% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure on the sheep, allowing their numbers to stabilize and grow, which is essential for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 38.10, which is only 3.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.87, which is only 2.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a slight increase in hunting intensity to ensure our own survival. A moderate increase to 0.35 allows for some hunting without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.32, which is only 2.1% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. This lower theta will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem while preventing overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow for recovery of the sheep. This small increase from my previous theta reflects a cautious approach to balance hunting and competition among wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 1.4% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also considering the growing wolf population. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure and support the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 12, which is only 1.2% of its maximum capacity. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover and prevents overexploitation, ensuring both our survival and the sustainability of the ecosystem. As the wolf population is relatively high, it is wise to focus on competition among wolves rather than hunting more sheep at this time.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the wolf population is relatively high. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a bit more hunting to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep further. This approach helps maintain a balance and allows for potential recovery of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. This lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we are overhunting. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment will help ensure the long-term survival of both species."
