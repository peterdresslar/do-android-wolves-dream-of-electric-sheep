            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 63.41, which is only 6.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.30 reflects a moderate approach, balancing the need to compete with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers sustainably.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the wolf population is relatively high. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help sustain our population while allowing the sheep to recover gradually. This small adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoids the risks of overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low at 0.03. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to rebound.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to recover. This approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both species and prevent a collapse of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting would further deplete their numbers and jeopardize the long-term survival of both species. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and my previous theta was too focused on competition with other wolves. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can help ensure the survival of my pack while still allowing the sheep population to recover gradually. This small adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",

To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity further to allow the sheep population to recover. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.20 to 0.25 reflects a cautious approach, prioritizing the sustainability of the ecosystem while still allowing for some competition among wolves.",

To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. A theta of 0.30 represents a cautious approach that balances the need for competition among wolves while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity. Focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to recover, ensuring a sustainable future for both species. A gradual approach is essential to avoid sudden crashes in either population.",

This indicates that aggressive hunting could lead to a further decline in sheep, jeopardizing the long-term survival of both species. By setting theta at 0.30, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover gradually, ensuring a sustainable balance.",

A gradual adjustment to 0.25 will help maintain a balance while still allowing for some competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are struggling, and focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting will allow the sheep to recover. A gradual increase in theta is necessary to ensure the long-term survival of both species, while also considering the current wolf population of 37, which is relatively stable. This approach will help maintain a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and my previous theta was already on the lower end. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for a modest increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach balances the need for wolf reproduction with the sustainability of the ecosystem.",
