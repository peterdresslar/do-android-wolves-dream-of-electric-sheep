            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual increase is prudent to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 27.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with a relatively high sheep-to-wolf ratio of 6.28, I need to be cautious about overhunting. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still enabling the sheep population to recover and maintain balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 23.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with a wolf population of 76, I need to be cautious about over-hunting. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to thrive. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level (16.3% of maximum capacity), which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between the wolf and sheep populations while allowing for some growth in the wolf pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 63.41, which is only 6.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a moderate approach, balancing the need to compete with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to ensure the wolf population remains healthy.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help achieve this balance without depleting the sheep further."
