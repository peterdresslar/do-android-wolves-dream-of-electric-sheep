            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 63.41, which is only 6.3% of its maximum capacity. While my previous theta of 0.650 allowed for some hunting, it is now crucial to focus on reducing competition with other wolves to ensure our population remains stable. A moderate theta of 0.40 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can allow the sheep population to recover while ensuring the long-term survival of both species. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 3.12, which is just 0.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. This lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their extinction. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.20 to 0.25, I can still focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population a chance to recover. This small adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem."
