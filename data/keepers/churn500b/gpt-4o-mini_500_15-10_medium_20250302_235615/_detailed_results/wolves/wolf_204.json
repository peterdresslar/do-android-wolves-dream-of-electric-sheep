            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 98\n- Sheep population: 62.70\n- Wolf population: 123.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.683\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.51 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 6.3% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 111\n- Sheep population: 4.51\n- Wolf population: 26.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.350\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.17 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 0.5% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3. Adjust your hunting intensity gradually in response to population changes\n4. Find a balance that creates sustainable cycles rather than crashes\n5.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 6.3% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are not enough sheep to sustain high hunting intensity without risking depletion. A moderate theta of 0.55 allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while also giving sheep a chance to recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.86, which is only 3.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.45 strikes a balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep, promoting sustainability without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.41, which is only 2.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing competition with other wolves, which will help stabilize our numbers and give the sheep a chance to rebound.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a significant competition for resources among wolves. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population, which is essential for our survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 0.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.7% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable for hunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This adjustment reflects a balance between ensuring the wolves can sustain themselves and allowing the sheep to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 5.93, which is only 0.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to increase. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 5.26, which is just 0.5% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population, which is essential for our future.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable for hunting. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing competition with other wolves. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and my previous theta was already low at 0.250. To allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining some hunting activity, a slight increase to 0.30 will help balance the needs of both populations without risking a further decline in sheep numbers. This approach aligns with the wisdom of making gradual adjustments in response to current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is very low at 4.49, which is only 0.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be kept low to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a small adjustment towards hunting while still prioritizing the sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population, which is crucial for the sustainability of our pack."
