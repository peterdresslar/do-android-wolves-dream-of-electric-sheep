            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 98\n- Sheep population: 62.70\n- Wolf population: 123.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.068\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.51 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 6.3% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

This indicates that the sheep need time to recover, and a lower hunting intensity will allow for their population to stabilize. Additionally, with a wolf population of 127, focusing on competition among wolves rather than aggressive hunting will help maintain a healthy balance in the ecosystem.",

To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. This gradual approach will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",

By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 7.06, which is only 0.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be cautiously increased to allow for some recovery of the sheep while still addressing the needs of the wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting sustainability without risking a crash in the sheep population.",
