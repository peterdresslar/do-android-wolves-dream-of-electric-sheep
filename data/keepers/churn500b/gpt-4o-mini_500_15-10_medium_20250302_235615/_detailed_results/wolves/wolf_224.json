            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 62.70, which is only 6.3% of its maximum capacity. While my previous theta of 0.654 allowed for some hunting, it is important to shift towards a more balanced approach to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.45 will help maintain a sustainable coexistence while still allowing for some hunting to support the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.86, which is only 3.6% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable balance, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting sheep. This moderate approach will help maintain the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to increase.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.41, which is only 2.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover.
