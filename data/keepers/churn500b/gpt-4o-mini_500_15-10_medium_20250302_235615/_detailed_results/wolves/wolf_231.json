            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently healthy at 251.53, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while still maintaining a sustainable balance with the sheep population. It\u2019s important to avoid overhunting, so a gradual increase is prudent.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 26.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, enabling sustainable coexistence while still allowing for some hunting to support the wolf population. This adjustment is gradual, responding to the current conditions without risking a sudden depletion of sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain our wolf population while still ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A moderate increase to 0.55 balances our need for food with the health of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 27.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with a relatively high sheep-to-wolf ratio of 6.28, I need to be cautious not to overhunt and deplete the sheep too quickly. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring both populations can thrive without leading to a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 23.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without risking depletion. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a more cautious approach, balancing the need for hunting with the necessity of maintaining a healthy sheep population as wolf numbers grow.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment reflects a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover and maintain their population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 63.41, which is only 6.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By setting a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow, while still maintaining a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably."
