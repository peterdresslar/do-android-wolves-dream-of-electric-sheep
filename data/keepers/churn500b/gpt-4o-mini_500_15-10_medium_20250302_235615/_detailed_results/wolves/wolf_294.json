        "explanations": [
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 23.9% of maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for increased hunting without risking immediate depletion. However, I must remain cautious and avoid drastic changes, so a moderate increase to 0.7 allows for sustainable hunting while still considering the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is necessary to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly, and this balance will support long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 63.41, which is only 6.3% of its maximum capacity. While my previous theta of 0.600 allowed for some hunting, it may be prudent to reduce hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. A moderate theta of 0.45 strikes a balance between competing with other wolves and allowing for sustainable coexistence, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. This lower theta will help create a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 5.70, which is just 0.6% of its maximum capacity. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.3% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain a balance and prevent overhunting, which could lead to a collapse of the sheep population."
