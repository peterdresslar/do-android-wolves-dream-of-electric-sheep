A gradual increase in theta will be necessary as the sheep population grows, but for now, a lower value will support long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. This approach supports long-term sustainability and prevents a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low at 0.03. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both species and prevent a crash in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 3.12, which is just 0.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity. Increasing my hunting intensity could lead to the extinction of sheep, which would ultimately harm the wolf population as well. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still considering the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their extinction. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population a chance to recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and prioritizes long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and my previous theta was too focused on competition with other wolves. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity, I can help stabilize the sheep population while still being cautious not to deplete them further. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to gradually recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of making small adjustments and ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity, which necessitates a cautious approach. Maintaining a low hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while also preventing overcompetition among wolves. This balance is essential for the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help the sheep population stabilize and gradually increase, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.79, which is only 0.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates a critical need for the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting sheep, allowing the sheep population a chance to rebound while also keeping the wolf population stable.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both species by preventing overhunting and allowing for a more sustainable balance."
