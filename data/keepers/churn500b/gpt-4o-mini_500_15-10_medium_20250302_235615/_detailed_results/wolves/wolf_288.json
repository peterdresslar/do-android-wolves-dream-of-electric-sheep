            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 23.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for increased hunting without risking immediate depletion. However, I want to avoid a drastic increase from my previous theta of 0.824, as maintaining a balance is crucial for long-term sustainability. A moderate increase to 0.7 allows for more hunting while still considering the health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 16.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance between wolf reproduction and sheep recovery, allowing both populations to thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 63.41, which is only 6.3% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.45 strikes a balance between hunting and allowing the sheep population to stabilize, preventing overexploitation while still enabling some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 5.70, which is just 0.6% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting sheep. This will allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 3.12, which is just 0.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash in both populations."
