            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level (17.7% of maximum capacity), allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking immediate depletion. This adjustment will help sustain our wolf population while still allowing sheep numbers to recover over time. A gradual approach is essential to maintain balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain the wolf population while still ensuring that the sheep can recover. A moderate increase to 0.70 allows for a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain the wolf population while ensuring the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 62.70, which is only 6.3% of its maximum capacity. While my previous theta of 0.600 was effective for hunting, it is important to allow the sheep population to recover. A moderate theta of 0.45 strikes a balance between hunting and ensuring the sustainability of both species, allowing for gradual adjustments as conditions change.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.86, which is only 3.6% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting. A theta of 0.35 represents a moderate approach that balances the need for wolf survival while giving sheep a chance to increase their numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 2.2% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 1.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover, and a slight increase in hunting intensity will allow for some sustainable hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for wolf reproduction with the necessity of allowing sheep to regain their numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity. Focusing on competition with other wolves rather than hunting will allow the sheep to recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a balance and ensuring the long-term survival of both species."
