            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 98\n- Sheep population: 62.70\n- Wolf population: 123.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.169\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.51 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 6.3% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population.",

To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the wolf population is relatively high. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while also reducing competition among wolves. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",

While I need to ensure the survival of my pack, I must also allow the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will help me maintain a balance between hunting and allowing sheep to repopulate, ensuring long-term sustainability.",

By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",

This indicates that hunting intensity should remain low to allow the sheep to recover. However, I also recognize that the wolf population is relatively high, so a slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted to maintain our numbers without depleting the sheep further. A theta of 0.35 allows for a cautious approach that balances the needs of both populations.",
