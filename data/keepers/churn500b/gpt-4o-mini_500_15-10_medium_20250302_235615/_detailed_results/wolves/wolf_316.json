            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help support wolf reproduction while still ensuring that the sheep population can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is necessary to maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 63.41, which is only 6.3% of its maximum capacity. While I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. A moderate decrease from my previous theta allows for a balance that can sustain both populations while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is quite high. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain their numbers. This balance is essential for the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 5.70, which is just 0.6% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. This lower theta will help balance the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population, which is essential for the sustainability of our pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 3.12, which is just 0.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that aggressive hunting could lead to their extinction. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a small increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and ensures the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity. Focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to recover, ensuring a sustainable future for both species. A gradual reduction in hunting intensity is necessary to prevent further depletion of the sheep population."
