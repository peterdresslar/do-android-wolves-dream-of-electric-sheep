            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 179\n- Sheep population: 0.71\n- Wolf population: 37.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.350\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.02 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 0.1% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 63.41, which is only 6.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species and allow the sheep population to gradually increase.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable for hunting. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing competition among wolves. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of sustainable coexistence and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 5.70, which is only 0.6% of its maximum capacity. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover and ensures the long-term survival of both species. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.03, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and my previous theta was already on the lower end. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for a modest increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach helps maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can allow the sheep to replenish their numbers while maintaining our wolf population sustainably.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their extinction. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.20 to 0.25, I can focus on competition with other wolves while allowing the sheep population a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity. Focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to recover, ensuring a sustainable future for both species. A gradual approach is necessary to avoid drastic impacts on the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity. Increasing hunting intensity could lead to the extinction of sheep, which would ultimately harm the wolf population as well. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population.",

By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to gradually increase in number while also managing competition with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that aggressive hunting could lead to a further decline in sheep numbers, jeopardizing the long-term survival of both species. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a sustainable wolf population.",

A slight increase to 0.35 allows for a cautious approach to hunting, which can help stabilize the sheep population while still considering the need for wolf reproduction. This small adjustment aligns with the wisdom of gradual changes and aims to maintain a sustainable balance.",
