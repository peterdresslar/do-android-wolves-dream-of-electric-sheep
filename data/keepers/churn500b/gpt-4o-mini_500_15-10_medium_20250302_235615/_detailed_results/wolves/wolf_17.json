            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is key to avoiding drastic fluctuations in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, allowing for some hunting without risking depletion. A moderate approach will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term survival for both. This adjustment reflects a cautious strategy to adapt to the current conditions while still allowing for some growth in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and while I want to ensure my pack thrives, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.0% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. A moderate increase to 0.45 reflects a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still allowing sheep to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that a more cautious approach is needed to allow for recovery. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can help ensure the sheep population stabilizes while still allowing for some hunting to maintain the wolf population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 77.70, which is only 7.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to stabilize while still competing with other wolves. This moderate approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 53.99, which is only 5.4% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity and give the sheep a chance to rebound, while also addressing the competition among wolves as our population is relatively high.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 38.10, which is only 3.8% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will enable me to maintain a balance between hunting and allowing the sheep to rebuild their numbers, avoiding any drastic changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.87, which is only 2.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover rather than intensifying hunting. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and promote a sustainable balance between wolves and sheep."
