            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 23.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with a wolf population of 76, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A moderate increase to 0.65 allows for a balance between hunting and ensuring the sheep can recover, while also considering the growth of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.3% of maximum capacity, which allows for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This value balances the need for wolf reproduction with the sustainability of the sheep population, ensuring both can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 63.41, which is only 6.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting. This theta value reflects a balanced approach that supports sustainable coexistence, allowing for gradual adjustments as the populations change.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting sheep. This will allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a balance in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover while managing competition with other wolves. A gradual decrease in theta will help maintain a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 3.12, which is just 0.3% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting. This lower theta will help stabilize the sheep population while also allowing for some competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity. This requires a cautious approach to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining some hunting to support the wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta will help balance the needs of both species without risking a crash."
