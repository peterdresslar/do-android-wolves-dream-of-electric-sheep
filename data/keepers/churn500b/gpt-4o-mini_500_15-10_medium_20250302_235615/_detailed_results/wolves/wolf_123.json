            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that they need time to recover. By reducing my hunting intensity slightly, I can allow the sheep to replenish while still competing with other wolves. This moderate approach helps maintain a balance between both populations, ensuring long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual increase is prudent to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.6% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a balance as the sheep population recovers, while also considering the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 6.3% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.86, which is only 3.6% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure long-term sustainability, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensifying hunting. This will help balance the ecosystem and prevent a crash in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.41, which is only 2.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach that acknowledges the need for hunting while still prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population, which is crucial for the future of my pack."
