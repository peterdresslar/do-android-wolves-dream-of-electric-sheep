            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain our wolf population while ensuring that the sheep do not become over-depleted. A gradual increase is necessary to adapt to the current conditions without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This approach balances the need for wolf reproduction while ensuring that the sheep population does not deplete too quickly. By gradually adjusting my hunting intensity, I can maintain a healthy ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that can support wolf reproduction while still enabling the sheep to recover. This adjustment reflects a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 62.70, which is only 6.3% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.86, which is only 3.6% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing competition with other wolves, which is necessary given the current dynamics.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.41, which is only 2.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while maintaining a stable wolf population. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure and promote a healthier ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting, which could lead to a crash.",

To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover.
