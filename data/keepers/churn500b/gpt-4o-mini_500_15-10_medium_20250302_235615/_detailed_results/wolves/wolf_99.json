            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 53.99, which is only 5.4% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting sheep. This lower theta will help balance the populations and promote long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 38.10, which is only 3.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.30 will help balance competition among wolves and give sheep a chance to increase their numbers without depleting them further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.87, which is only 2.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a slight hunting intensity to support the wolf population. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.30 to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach that considers both the immediate needs of the wolves and the sustainability of the ecosystem.",

To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep to recover. This will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.85, which is only 1.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.30 to 0.35, I can still maintain some hunting pressure while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of avoiding sudden changes and focusing on sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.4% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting, which could lead to a crash in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.00, which is only 1.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover, and a slight increase in hunting intensity will allow for some sustainable hunting while still prioritizing the sheep",

To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash in both populations.",

To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. A gradual adjustment to 0.25 will help maintain a balance while preventing further depletion of the sheep.",

To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a presence in the ecosystem. A slight increase from my previous theta will help balance my competition with other wolves and allow for some hunting, but not at the expense of depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the wolf population is relatively high. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help sustain wolf reproduction while allowing for some recovery of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.19, which is only 0.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting to support the wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a cautious approach to hunting without risking a rapid depletion of the sheep.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.73, which is only 1.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is an opportunity to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A moderate increase to 0.45 maintains a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.66, which is only 1.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover.
