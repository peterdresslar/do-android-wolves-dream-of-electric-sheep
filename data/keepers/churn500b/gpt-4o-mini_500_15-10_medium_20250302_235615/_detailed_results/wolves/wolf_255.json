            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 27.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. A moderate approach allows for coexistence while still enabling the wolf population to thrive. This adjustment is gradual, reflecting the need to balance hunting intensity with the current state of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 23.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. A slight reduction from my previous theta allows for a more cautious approach as the wolf population is relatively stable, ensuring we don",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still considering the need for coexistence. A gradual increase aligns with the current trends and ensures we do not overreach.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 63.41, which is only 6.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover, and a lower hunting intensity will allow for their population to stabilize. Additionally, with a wolf population of 192, it is wise to focus on competition among wolves rather than aggressive hunting, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 0.6% of its maximum capacity. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover while also preventing overcompetition among wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and ensures the long-term survival of both populations."
