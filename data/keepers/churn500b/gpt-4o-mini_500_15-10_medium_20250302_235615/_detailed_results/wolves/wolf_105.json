            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that balances the needs of both wolves and sheep. This approach supports sustainable coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves. It is important to avoid overhunting at this stage to prevent a crash in the sheep population, which could ultimately harm the wolf pack as well.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution in hunting. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, enabling the sheep to recover while still supporting the wolf population. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of gradual changes and sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.7% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite high at 23.83. This suggests that while there is an opportunity for hunting, it is crucial to avoid overexploitation to allow the sheep population to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 178, which is a healthy number, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with a wolf population of 10, I need to be cautious not to over-hunt and risk depleting the sheep. A theta of 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This will help support the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 19.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with a relatively high sheep-to-wolf ratio of 9.16, it is wise to focus on competition with other wolves to ensure our population remains stable. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of sheep and maintaining a balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual increase is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment reflects a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover. By adopting a lower hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both our wolf pack and the sheep, while also reducing competition among wolves as our numbers grow.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.6% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 6.3% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain its health. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments to ensure long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.86, which is only 3.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both the sheep and the wolf population, while still competing with other wolves. A gradual approach will help maintain balance in the ecosystem."
