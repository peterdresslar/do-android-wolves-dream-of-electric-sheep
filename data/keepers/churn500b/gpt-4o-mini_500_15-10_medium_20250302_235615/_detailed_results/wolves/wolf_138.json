            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual approach is essential to maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.6% of maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a slight surplus of sheep. A moderate hunting intensity will allow for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves. This approach helps to prevent overhunting and allows the sheep population to recover gradually.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 62.70, which is only 6.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. A lower theta allows for a focus on competition with other wolves, which can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to increase. Gradually adjusting my hunting intensity will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.86, which is only 3.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while avoiding over-depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.41, which is only 2.2% of its maximum capacity. While I need to focus on hunting to ensure the survival of my pack, I must also be cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that supports both my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. This suggests that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to increase.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves.
