            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.0% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can recover over time.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively low at 10.6% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 77.70, which is only 7.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.35, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to gradually increase while maintaining a stable wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at only 5.4% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a stable wolf population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 38.10, which is only 3.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.30 to 0.35, I can still focus on competition with other wolves while allowing for a gradual increase in hunting. This approach helps maintain a balance between the wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term survival for both.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.87, which is only 2.8% of its maximum capacity. Given the high wolf population of 93, it is crucial to focus on competition among wolves to allow the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help maintain a balance and prevent overhunting, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.32, which is only 2.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a slight hunting intensity to support our own population. A small increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a gradual adjustment that balances our needs with the sustainability of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.7% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.95, which is only 1.4% of its maximum capacity. While I need to focus on hunting to ensure the survival of my pack, I must also consider the long-term health of the sheep population. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of sheep, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 12.00, which is just 1.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By focusing more on competing with other wolves, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting sheep. This will allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a sustainable balance."
