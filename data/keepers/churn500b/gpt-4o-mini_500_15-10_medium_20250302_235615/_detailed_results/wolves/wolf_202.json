            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 97\n- Sheep population: 105.61\n- Wolf population: 102.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.300\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 1.04 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 10.6% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.6% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. A moderate increase to 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 6.3% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. By focusing on competing with other wolves, I can allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a stable wolf population. This gradual approach will help ensure long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.86, which is only 3.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is an opportunity for the sheep to recover if I maintain a cautious approach. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.30 to 0.35, I can still focus on sustainable coexistence while allowing for some reproduction among wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.41, which is only 2.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. A theta of 0.30 reflects a cautious approach that balances competition with other wolves while giving sheep a chance to increase their numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and my previous theta was already on the lower end. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for a modest increase in hunting intensity, which can help sustain my pack while still giving the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help create a more sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.9% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a significant competition for resources. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A gradual increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should remain cautious to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, it is crucial to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help stabilize the ecosystem while also considering the current high wolf population, which is at risk of competing for resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to replenish while still competing with other wolves. This gradual adjustment helps maintain a balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help the sheep population stabilize, ensuring long-term survival for both species. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are in a vulnerable state, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to their depletion. By slightly increasing my theta to 0.25, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population a chance to recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 4.49, which is only 0.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are struggling, and if I increase my hunting intensity too much, it could lead to their depletion and ultimately harm the wolf population as well. A theta of 0.30 allows me to focus on competing with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to recover, ensuring a more sustainable balance in the ecosystem."
