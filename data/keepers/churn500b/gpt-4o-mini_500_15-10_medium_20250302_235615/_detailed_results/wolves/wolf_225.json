            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.86, which is only 3.6% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.45 strikes a balance between hunting and allowing the sheep population to stabilize, promoting long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.41, which is only 2.2% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable balance, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intense hunting. A theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a significant competition for resources among wolves. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on reducing competition among wolves, allowing the sheep population to recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure and give the sheep a chance to rebound, while also managing competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 0.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 7.06, which is only 0.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are struggling, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.30 to 0.35, I can still maintain some hunting pressure while prioritizing the long-term survival of both species. This small adjustment aligns with the wisdom of gradual changes and helps ensure a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are not enough sheep to sustain aggressive hunting. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to recover while ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable for hunting. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing competition with other wolves. This gradual adjustment will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",

A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. This suggests that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own population. A moderate theta will help maintain a balance, allowing for some hunting while prioritizing the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.4% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover.

A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a more balanced approach, enabling me to hunt while still allowing the sheep population to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep further.
