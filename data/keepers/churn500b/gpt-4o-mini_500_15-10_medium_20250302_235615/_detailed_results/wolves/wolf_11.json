            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 27\n- Sheep population: 120.93\n- Wolf population: 5.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.433\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 24.19 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 12.1% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A balanced approach at this stage will promote coexistence and prevent over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 130.04, which is only 13.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is an opportunity for hunting, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to allow the sheep population to recover. A moderate theta of 0.40 allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help support wolf reproduction while still ensuring that the sheep population can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance and avoid over-depletion of resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing coexistence. This value balances the need for wolf reproduction with the necessity of allowing the sheep population to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term survival of both species. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to ensure that the sheep can recover while maintaining a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual increase is prudent to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and while it is important to maintain my hunting to support wolf reproduction, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will help balance the ecosystem and ensure both populations can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level (13.0% of maximum capacity), allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still being cautious. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring both populations can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.6% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. However, with the wolf population at 74, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively low at 7.8% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations while still focusing on competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 53.99, which is only 5.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.4 to 0.35, I can maintain a focus on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 38.10, which is only 3.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help the sheep population stabilize while also managing competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.87, which is only 2.8% of its maximum capacity. While I need to focus on hunting to ensure the survival of my pack, I must also be cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep, maintaining a balance that supports both populations."
