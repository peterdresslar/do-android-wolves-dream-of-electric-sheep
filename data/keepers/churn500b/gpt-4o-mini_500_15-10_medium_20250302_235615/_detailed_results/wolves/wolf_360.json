            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 63.41, which is only 6.3% of its maximum capacity. While I need to maintain a focus on hunting to support the wolf population, I must also be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A theta of 0.75 allows for increased hunting intensity while still considering the need for sheep recovery and the long-term balance of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is high. A moderate hunting intensity will allow for some recovery of the sheep while still enabling the wolves to sustain themselves. This balance is crucial to avoid depleting the sheep further and to ensure long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 5.70, which is only 0.6% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. This will help create a more sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and a slight increase in hunting intensity will help sustain my pack without depleting the sheep further. This moderate adjustment allows for a cautious approach to hunting while still considering the need for wolf population stability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity. Focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to recover while preventing further depletion. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. A gradual approach will help maintain balance and prevent a crash in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity. Increasing hunting intensity could lead to the extinction of sheep, which would ultimately harm the wolf population as well. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover rather than intensifying hunting. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population, which is essential for the future of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their extinction. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from the previous theta of 0.20 to 0.25, I can still focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance."
