            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 23.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 3.15, it is wise to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while still competing with other wolves. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.3% of maximum capacity, and my previous theta was quite low at 0.25. To allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a focus on competition with other wolves, a slight increase to 0.30 will help balance the needs of both populations without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 63.41, which is only 6.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is a need for a cautious approach to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will enable me to maintain some hunting pressure while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring a balance that supports both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 14.71, which is only 1.5% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity and give the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, while also allowing the wolf population to stabilize without overexploiting the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 5.70, which is just 0.6% of its maximum capacity. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover and stabilize, ensuring the long-term survival of both species. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.03, it is essential to prioritize the recovery of the sheep population over immediate hunting gains.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 3.12, which is just 0.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both species by preventing further depletion of the sheep population while we focus on competing with other wolves."
