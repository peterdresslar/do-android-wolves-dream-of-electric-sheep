            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level (10.6% of maximum capacity), allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This value balances the need for wolf reproduction with the sustainability of the sheep population, ensuring both can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 77.70, which is only 7.8% of its maximum capacity. While my previous theta of 0.55 allowed for some hunting, it is important to reduce hunting intensity slightly to allow the sheep population to recover. This adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance between wolves and sheep, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 5.4% of maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can grow, which is crucial for long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 38.10, which is only 3.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population, while also considering the current high wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a need for caution. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This balanced approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining sustainable cycles.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at only 2.1% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help create a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.85, which is only 1.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity to 0.35, I can still focus on competition with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.4% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. This lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 12, which is just 1.2% of its maximum capacity. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover and increases their population, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem. Given the high wolf population, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to replenish their numbers while also ensuring that the wolf population does not deplete too quickly. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is unsustainable. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing competition with other wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem."
