            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.3% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. A gradual increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still allowing sheep to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 63.41, which is only 6.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting a lower theta, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain balance and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 5.70, which is only 0.6% of its maximum capacity. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover and ensures the long-term survival of both species. Given the high wolf population, it is crucial to avoid overhunting and to focus on competition with other wolves instead.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 0.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from the previous theta of 0.30 to 0.35, I can still focus on competing with other wolves while allowing for some sustainable hunting. This small adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity. To allow for recovery and ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting sheep. This will help the sheep population rebound while also managing the wolf population sustainably.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. A gradual approach will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help sustain my pack without depleting the sheep further. This gradual adjustment allows for recovery of the sheep while still considering the needs of my pack."
