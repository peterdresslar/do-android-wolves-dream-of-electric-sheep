        "explanations": [
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level (13.0% of maximum capacity), which allows for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This value supports sustainable coexistence while still enabling the wolf population to thrive. It reflects a balanced approach, considering both the need to hunt and the importance of not overexploiting the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.6% of its maximum capacity, which suggests that a more moderate hunting intensity is appropriate. This will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain its health. A gradual adjustment towards a balanced approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 7.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow for recovery. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to rebound. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 53.99, which is only 5.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover, and focusing on competition with other wolves will allow for a more sustainable environment for both species. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is quite low at 3.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a more balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting to support the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.87, which is only 2.8% of its maximum capacity. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while also addressing the competition among wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.32, which is only 2.1% of its maximum capacity. While I need to focus on hunting to ensure the survival of my pack, I must also be cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a more balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.7% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable for hunting. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and my previous theta was already on the lower end. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for a modest increase in hunting intensity, which can help sustain my pack while still giving the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we are at risk of depleting their numbers if we hunt too aggressively. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing competition with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and my previous theta of 0.300 was already focused on competition rather than hunting. To allow the sheep to recover, I need to further reduce my hunting intensity while still keeping an eye on the wolf population. This gradual adjustment will help maintain balance in the ecosystem."
