            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively low at 15.5% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that can help maintain a balance. This approach will enable the sheep to recover while also ensuring that the wolf population remains healthy. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize our numbers without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a sustainable balance. This adjustment will help support the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level (10.6% of maximum capacity), allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing sheep to recover. A gradual increase aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 77.70, which is only 7.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a presence in the hunting cycle. A lower theta will help reduce pressure on the sheep, allowing their numbers to stabilize, while also managing competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 53.99, which is only 5.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover, and focusing on competition with other wolves will help maintain our population while allowing the sheep to bounce back. A lower theta will help ensure a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 38.10, which is only 3.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that I should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a slight increase in hunting intensity to ensure the wolf population remains healthy. A gradual increase to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while being mindful of the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.87, which is only 2.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.32, which is only 2.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a slight hunting intensity to support our own population. A small increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence and preventing overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while ensuring the sheep have a chance to increase their numbers, promoting long-term sustainability for both species.",
