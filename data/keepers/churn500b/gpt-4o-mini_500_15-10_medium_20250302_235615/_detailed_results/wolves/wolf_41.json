            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain the wolf population while still ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual increase in theta reflects the need to adapt to the current conditions without risking a depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level (13.0% of maximum capacity), allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking their long-term survival. This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population while still being mindful of the need for balance as both populations fluctuate.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level (10.6% of maximum capacity), allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This value strikes a balance between ensuring my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 77.70, which is only 7.8% of its maximum capacity. While I want to ensure the survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while not overly depleting the sheep population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and responding to the current state of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 53.99, which is only 5.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By setting a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to gradually increase while ensuring our own numbers remain stable. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 38.10, which is only 3.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.87, which is only 2.8% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 2.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to replenish their numbers while also managing competition with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is quite low at 16.85, which is only 1.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting to support the wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a cautious approach to hunting, balancing the need for sustenance with the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help ensure the sheep have a chance to rebound while also allowing the wolf population to stabilize. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of adapting to changing conditions without causing sudden disruptions."
