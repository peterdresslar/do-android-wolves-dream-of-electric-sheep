            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both populations. This adjustment reflects a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for recovery. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to rebound while still enabling the wolf population to maintain its health. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of making gradual changes to ensure long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 6.3% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. A lower theta allows for a focus on competition among wolves, which can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.86, which is only 3.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.30 reflects a cautious approach, focusing more on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.41, which is only 2.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is a need for cautious hunting to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting to support the wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a significant competition for resources among wolves. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and prioritizes long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their extinction. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can help the sheep recover while ensuring our own population stabilizes. This gradual approach allows for a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and my previous theta was already on the lower end. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I will maintain a cautious approach, allowing the sheep population to recover while still competing with other wolves. This gradual adjustment will help create a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 0.7% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 5.93, which is only 0.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance."
