            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 14.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. A moderate increase to 0.50 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still enabling the sheep population to recover. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in response to changing conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term health of both sheep and wolves. This moderate adjustment helps maintain balance and avoids over-depletion of sheep resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term survival of both species. This moderate adjustment helps maintain a balance as the wolf population is relatively low compared to the sheep, ensuring we do not over-deplete the sheep while still allowing for some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual increase is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly, and I want to remain responsive to both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, allowing for a moderate approach to hunting. This will help maintain the sheep population while also allowing for some hunting to support the wolf population. A gradual adjustment is necessary to avoid depleting the sheep further and to ensure a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.0% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover gradually. A moderate increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, considering both the current state and the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.6% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. A moderate increase to 0.45 will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing sheep to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 77.70, which is only 7.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own population. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure and promote a more sustainable balance between wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 53.99, which is only 5.4% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting sheep. This will help balance the populations and avoid depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 38.10, which is only 3.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a slight focus on hunting to support our wolf population. A small increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a more balanced approach, promoting coexistence while being mindful of the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.87, which is only 2.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover rather than intensifying hunting. A lower theta will help maintain a balance, reduce competition among wolves, and support the long-term survival of both species."
