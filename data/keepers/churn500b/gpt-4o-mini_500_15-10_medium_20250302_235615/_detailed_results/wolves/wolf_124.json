            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.0% of its maximum capacity, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can recover over time.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 17.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for increased hunting without risking immediate depletion. However, with a wolf population of 50, I must also be cautious to avoid overhunting. A slight increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach that supports both wolf reproduction and sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a slight overpopulation of wolves. A moderate decrease in hunting intensity will allow sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of ensuring long-term survival and balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 6.3% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. A lower theta allows for a focus on competition among wolves, which can help stabilize our numbers while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.86, which is only 3.6% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure long-term sustainability, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting. This will help balance the ecosystem and prevent a crash in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.41, which is only 2.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity to 0.35, I can still focus on competition with other wolves while allowing for some sustainable hunting. This approach helps maintain the balance between both populations without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low at 0.13. This indicates that the sheep are under significant pressure, and focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while allowing for a gradual recovery of the sheep population."
