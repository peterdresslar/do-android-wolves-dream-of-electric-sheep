This adjustment is moderate enough to avoid over-depleting the sheep while allowing for some growth in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 77.70, which is only 7.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both populations. It also helps to avoid competition with other wolves, which is crucial as the wolf population is relatively high.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 53.99, which is only 5.4% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help the sheep population rebound while also managing competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 38.10, which is only 3.8% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.87, which is only 2.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover, and focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to stabilize while preventing overhunting. A lower theta will help maintain the balance in the ecosystem and ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.32, which is only 2.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting for the wolves",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.85, which is only 1.7% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity and give the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, while also addressing the competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow for recovery. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must prioritize the long-term survival of both species. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 12.00, which is only 1.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, it is crucial to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population, which would ultimately harm the wolf population as well.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 1.1% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover and prevents overexploitation. This approach also helps ensure the long-term survival of both species, as a balanced ecosystem is crucial for our future.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. A gradual decrease in theta will help maintain a balance while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep."
