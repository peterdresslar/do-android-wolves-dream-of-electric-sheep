            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level (13.0% of maximum capacity), allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking immediate depletion. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sustainable coexistence as the sheep population recovers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.6% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A moderate increase to 0.70 reflects a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 77.70, which is only 7.8% of its maximum capacity. While my previous theta of 0.700 was effective for reproduction, it is now important to balance hunting with the need for sheep recovery. A moderate theta of 0.50 allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some hunting to support the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 53.99, which is only 5.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting theta at 0.40, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to gradually increase, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 38.10, which is only 3.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By setting a lower theta, I can focus more on competing with other wolves and allow the sheep population to stabilize. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.87, which is only 2.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.32, which is only 2.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are struggling, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.300 to 0.35, I can maintain a focus on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring a gradual balance that supports both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 1.7% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting sheep. This will allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.95, which is only 1.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should remain low to allow the sheep to recover. However, with the wolf population at 69.00, a slight increase in theta to 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the sustainability of both populations. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 12.00, which is only 1.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting sheep. This will allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a stable wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.1% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain balance and prevent overhunting."
