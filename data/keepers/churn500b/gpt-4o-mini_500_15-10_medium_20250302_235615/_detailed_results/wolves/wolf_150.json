            "I chose this theta because it represents a balanced approach to hunting. The sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for moderate hunting that can support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy ecosystem while also considering the growth of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for moderate hunting without risking depletion. This value reflects a balanced approach, enabling us to maintain our wolf population while ensuring the sheep can recover and thrive. It also allows for gradual adjustments as conditions change.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.6% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help ensure the sheep can recover without depleting their numbers too quickly, while also allowing the wolf population to remain healthy.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 62.70, which is only 6.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that the sheep need time to recover, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to rebuild their numbers. Additionally, with a wolf population of 123, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.86, which is only 3.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover rather than intensifying hunting. A lower theta value will help reduce competition among wolves while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, promoting a more sustainable ecosystem in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.41, which is only 2.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable, and while I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must prioritize the recovery of the sheep. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach to hunting while still focusing on the competition with other wolves, ensuring that both populations can stabilize and thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. A gradual decrease in theta will help maintain a balance and prevent a crash in the ecosystem.",
