This will help balance the needs of both populations without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover while still maintaining a presence in the ecosystem. A slight increase from my previous theta will help balance the need for hunting with the necessity of sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 5.70, which is only 0.6% of its maximum capacity. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover and increases the chances of sustainable coexistence. Additionally, with a wolf population of 179, focusing on competition among wolves rather than aggressive hunting will help ensure our long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 3.12, which is just 0.3% of its maximum capacity. Maintaining a low hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover and prevent further depletion. Additionally, with a high wolf population of 154, focusing on competition among wolves rather than aggressive hunting will help stabilize our numbers and promote long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their extinction. By focusing on competition with other wolves and reducing hunting intensity, I can help the sheep recover while maintaining the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity. Focusing on competition with other wolves rather than hunting will allow the sheep to recover, ensuring a sustainable ecosystem in the long run. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining balance and adapting to the current state of both populations.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their extinction. By focusing on competition with other wolves at a lower theta, I can allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity, I can still maintain some pressure on the sheep while allowing them to rebound. This gradual adjustment helps ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.79, which is only 0.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are in a vulnerable state, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.30 to 0.35, I can still maintain some hunting pressure while prioritizing the sustainability of both populations. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
