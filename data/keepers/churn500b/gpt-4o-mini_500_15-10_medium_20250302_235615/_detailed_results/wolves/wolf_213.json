            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 62.70, which is only 6.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta value will help balance competition among wolves and give sheep a chance to increase their numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.86, which is only 3.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow the sheep to recover while also considering the growing wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach, promoting sustainability without over-depleting the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.41, which is only 2.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while maintaining a stable wolf population. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure and promote a healthier ecosystem balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and my previous theta was already at a lower level. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach to hunting while still being cautious about the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help the sheep population stabilize while also reducing competition among wolves, which is essential given the current high wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 0.9% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain balance and prevent further depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.7% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. A gradual increase in theta will help maintain a balance while ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 5.93, which is only 0.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should remain low to allow the sheep to recover. However, a slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 is warranted to adapt to the current conditions and ensure the wolf population remains healthy without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help the sheep population bounce back while also managing the competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will reduce hunting pressure, giving the sheep a chance to rebound while still allowing for some competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity. Increasing hunting intensity could lead to a further decline in sheep, jeopardizing the long-term survival of both species. A theta of 0.30 allows for a slight increase in hunting while prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population, ensuring a more sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and a slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep further. This adjustment allows for a gradual response to the current low sheep population while still considering the need for wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both species by preventing overhunting and allowing for a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.5% of its maximum capacity. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while also reducing competition among wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while preventing overcompetition among wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments to ensure long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution in hunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 4.84, which is only 0.5% of its maximum capacity. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover and increases the chances of sustainable coexistence. Additionally, with the wolf population at 16.00, focusing on competition among wolves rather than aggressive hunting will help stabilize our numbers while giving sheep a chance to rebound."
