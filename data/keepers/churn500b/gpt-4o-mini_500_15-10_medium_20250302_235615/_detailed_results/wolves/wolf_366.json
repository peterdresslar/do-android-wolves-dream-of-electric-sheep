            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 63.41, which is only 6.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta value of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both populations. It also helps to prevent overexploitation of the sheep, ensuring that the wolf population can thrive in the future.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain balance and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 5.70, which is just 0.6% of its maximum capacity. Given the high wolf population of 179, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 3.12, which is only 0.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover, and focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting will allow the sheep population to stabilize. A gradual approach is essential to ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain a balance and prevent further depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity, and my previous theta was already low. To allow the sheep to recover and avoid depleting their numbers further, I will make a small increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing competition with other wolves. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity. Focusing on competition with other wolves rather than hunting sheep will allow the sheep population to recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance and ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity. Increasing my hunting intensity could lead to the extinction of sheep, which would ultimately harm the wolf population in the long run. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring that both populations can recover sustainably."
