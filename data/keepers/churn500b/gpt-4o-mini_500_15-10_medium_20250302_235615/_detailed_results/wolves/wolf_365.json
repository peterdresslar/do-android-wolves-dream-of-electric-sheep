            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 63.41, which is only 6.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is potential for recovery if I reduce hunting intensity slightly. A theta of 0.65 allows for moderate hunting while still considering the need for sheep to recover, ensuring a sustainable balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while still competing with other wolves. A moderate theta will help maintain a balance and avoid depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 5.70, which is just 0.6% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.3% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. Focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep population to recover while ensuring our pack does not overhunt and face a crash. A gradual adjustment is necessary to maintain balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and my previous focus on competition has not allowed for recovery. A slight increase in hunting intensity is necessary to ensure the survival of my pack, but I must remain cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. This gradual adjustment allows for a potential rebound in sheep numbers while still considering the current low ratio of sheep to wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity. With such a small number of sheep, intense hunting would further deplete their numbers and jeopardize the long-term survival of both species. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population a chance to recover while ensuring the wolf pack remains stable.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity. With such a small number of sheep, increasing hunting intensity could lead to their extinction, which would ultimately harm the wolf population as well. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring both populations have a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help balance the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population, which is essential for the future of my pack."
