This value reflects a cautious approach, ensuring that we do not deplete the sheep further while still allowing for some hunting to support our population. It also considers the need to adapt to the current wolf population, which is relatively high.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 77.70, which is only 7.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 53.99, which is only 5.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to replenish their numbers while also managing competition with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 38.10, which is only 3.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity to 0.35, I can still focus on competition with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.87, which is only 2.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.32, which is only 2.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting for the wolves. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will help balance the need for food with the sustainability of the sheep population, avoiding overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.85, which is only 1.7% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensifying hunting. This will help balance the populations and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution in hunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that supports wolf reproduction while giving sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 12, which is only 1.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. A theta of 0.30 reflects a cautious approach that prioritizes the sustainability of the ecosystem while still allowing for some competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.1% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent further depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity. Increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in sheep, jeopardizing both species"
