            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 63.41, which is only 6.3% of its maximum capacity. While I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A theta of 0.75 allows for increased hunting while still considering the need for sheep recovery and maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low at 0.07. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover while still maintaining a focus on competition with other wolves. A moderate theta of 0.40 allows for a balanced approach that supports both the recovery of sheep and the sustainability of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 5.70, which is only 0.6% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will reduce hunting intensity and give the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, while also managing the competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.3% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity. Increasing hunting intensity could lead to the extinction of sheep, which would ultimately harm the wolf population as well. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover, ensuring a sustainable future for both wolves and sheep. It",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity. Focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to recover, ensuring long-term survival for both species. A gradual approach is necessary to avoid depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.10, which is just 0.1% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.10 to 0.20 reflects a cautious approach that prioritizes the sustainability of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution in hunting. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.20 to 0.25, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance."
