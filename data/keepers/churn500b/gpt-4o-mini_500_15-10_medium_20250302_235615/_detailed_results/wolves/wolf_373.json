            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 63.41, which is only 6.3% of its maximum capacity. While my previous theta of 0.596 reflects a more aggressive hunting strategy, it is important to reduce hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. A moderate theta of 0.45 strikes a balance between competing with other wolves and allowing the sheep to increase in number, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 3.12, which is just 0.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting sheep. This will allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 2.06, which is just 0.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that aggressive hunting could lead to the extinction of sheep, jeopardizing the long-term survival of both species. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring that we do not deplete the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity. It is essential to focus on reducing competition with other wolves to allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both species by preventing further depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity, which necessitates a cautious approach. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.20 to 0.25, I can still focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. A gradual decrease in theta will help maintain a balance and prevent a crash in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a presence in the ecosystem. A gradual increase in theta will help balance the competition with other wolves and give the sheep a chance to rebound.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their depletion and jeopardize the long-term survival of both species. A theta of 0.30 allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population, ensuring a more sustainable balance."
