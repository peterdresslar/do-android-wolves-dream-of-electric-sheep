            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep do not deplete too quickly. A gradual adjustment is key to maintaining balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain our wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance and avoid over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 16.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population also being significant, I need to balance hunting with competition among wolves. A moderate theta of 0.55 allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still promoting coexistence and preventing depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 63.41, which is only 6.3% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure my pack's survival through hunting, I must also allow the sheep population to recover. A moderate theta of 0.45 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for some hunting while prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is quite high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help create a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 5.70, which is just 0.6% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population, which is essential for the sustainability of our pack."
