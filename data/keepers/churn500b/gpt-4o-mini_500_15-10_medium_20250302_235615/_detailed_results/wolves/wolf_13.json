            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level (14.0% of maximum capacity), allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking immediate depletion. This adjustment will help ensure the wolf population can thrive while still allowing for some recovery of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is key to avoiding drastic fluctuations in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that can support wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This balance helps maintain the ecosystem's health and prevents over-depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting approach. This will help maintain the balance between wolves and sheep while ensuring that both populations can thrive in the long term. A gradual adjustment is necessary to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly, especially since the wolf population is relatively low.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep. This moderate adjustment helps maintain our wolf population without over-depleting the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.6% of its maximum capacity, which indicates a need for caution in hunting. By lowering my hunting intensity slightly, I can allow the sheep to recover while still competing with other wolves. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still being mindful of the sheep's recovery. A gradual increase aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.6% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. A moderate increase to 0.45 reflects a balanced approach that supports wolf reproduction while still allowing for sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 77.70, which is only 7.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing more on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 53.99, which is only 5.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers. A gradual approach is essential to avoid sudden crashes in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is quite low at 3.8% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a bit more hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance without risking a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 2.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a significant competition for resources. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of my ancestors, ensuring long-term survival for both species."
