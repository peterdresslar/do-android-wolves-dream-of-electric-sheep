            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for some increased hunting intensity without risking depletion. However, I must remain cautious and avoid drastic changes, as the wolf population is relatively small. A moderate increase will help sustain our numbers while still allowing the sheep to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid over-depletion of the sheep and to keep the ecosystem balanced.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight reduction in hunting intensity. This will help maintain the balance between wolves and sheep while still enabling some reproduction among the wolf population. A moderate approach will ensure that we do not deplete the sheep too quickly, allowing for long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, allowing for some hunting without risking depletion. However, with a relatively high sheep-to-wolf ratio, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure the long-term survival of both species. A moderate theta allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.0% of maximum capacity, indicating that they need time to recover. A moderate hunting intensity will allow for some sheep population growth while also ensuring that the wolf population remains stable. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population also being significant, I must be cautious not to overhunt and risk depleting the sheep. A moderate increase to 0.45 reflects a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 77.70, which is only 7.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover rather than intensifying hunting. A moderate theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can stabilize and grow.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 53.99, which is only 5.4% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting. This will help balance the populations over time.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 38.10, which is only 3.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a slight hunting intensity. A small increase to 0.35 will help balance the need for wolf reproduction with the necessity of not depleting the sheep population further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.87, which is only 2.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover rather than intensifying our hunting. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and ensure that both our wolf population and the sheep can thrive in the long run.",
