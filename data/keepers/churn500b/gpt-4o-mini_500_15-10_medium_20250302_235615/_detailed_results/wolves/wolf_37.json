            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are more sheep available relative to wolves. This suggests that I can afford to increase my hunting intensity slightly without risking the depletion of the sheep population. However, I want to remain cautious and avoid sudden changes, so a small increase to 0.32 allows for a balanced approach while still focusing on the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.0% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.6% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help sustain both the wolf and sheep populations while also considering the need for gradual changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 77.70, which is only 7.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our needs without depleting the sheep further, promoting a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 53.99, which is only 5.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By focusing on competition with other wolves at a lower theta, I can help ensure that the sheep population has the opportunity to rebound while also maintaining a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 38.10, which is only 3.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a slight hunting intensity. A small increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.87, which is only 2.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover, and a lower hunting intensity will allow for their population to stabilize. Additionally, with a wolf population of 93, focusing on competition among wolves rather than intense hunting will help maintain our numbers while giving the sheep a chance to bounce back.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.32, which is only 2.1% of its maximum capacity. While I need to focus on hunting to ensure the survival of my pack, I must also be cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the immediate needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.85, which is only 1.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.95, which is only 1.4% of its maximum capacity. While I need to focus on hunting to ensure the survival of my pack, I must also be cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a more balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the immediate needs of my pack."
