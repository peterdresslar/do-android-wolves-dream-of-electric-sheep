            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 1.4% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure long-term sustainability, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting intensively. This will help balance the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and my previous theta was already on the lower end. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a presence in the ecosystem. A slight increase to 0.30 allows for a balanced approach that encourages sheep recovery without putting too much pressure on their population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the wolf population is relatively high. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help us maintain our population while allowing the sheep to recover gradually. This approach aligns with the wisdom of making small adjustments to ensure a sustainable balance."
