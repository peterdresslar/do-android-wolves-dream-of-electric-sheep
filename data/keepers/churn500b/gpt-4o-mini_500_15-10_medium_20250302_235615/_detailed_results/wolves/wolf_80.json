            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 36\n- Sheep population: 105.71\n- Wolf population: 74.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.157\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 1.43 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 10.6% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.6% of maximum capacity, and my previous theta was quite low at 0.157. To allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a focus on competition with other wolves, a slight increase to 0.25 will help balance the needs of both populations without risking a sudden depletion of sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 77.70, which is only 7.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and promotes long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 53.99, which is only 5.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a slight focus on hunting to support our wolf population. A moderate increase from my previous theta of 0.30 to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 38.10, which is only 3.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity and give the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, while also allowing the wolf population to stabilize without overexploiting the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.87, which is only 2.8% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will enable me to hunt a bit more effectively while still prioritizing the sustainability of both populations. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.32, which is only 2.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. Maintaining a lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both species and prevent a crash in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.85, which is only 1.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity to 0.35, I can still focus on competition with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 1.4% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12, which is only 1.2% of its maximum capacity. While I need to focus on hunting to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.1% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we are overhunting. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing competition among wolves. This approach aligns with my objective of ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to replenish while still competing with other wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a significant imbalance. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing competition with other wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of sustainable coexistence and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.30, which is only 0.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that the sheep are in a vulnerable state, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to their depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 to 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach, enabling me to compete with other wolves while still giving the sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.09, which is only 0.9% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable balance, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensifying hunting. This approach will help stabilize both populations in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and my previous theta was already on the lower end. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for a modest increase in hunting intensity, which can help support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. This approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence."
