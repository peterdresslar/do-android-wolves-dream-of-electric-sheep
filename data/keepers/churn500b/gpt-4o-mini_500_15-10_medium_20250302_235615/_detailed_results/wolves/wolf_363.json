            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 6.3% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a scarcity of prey. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing competition with other wolves. A gradual increase in theta will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable for hunting. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover, ensuring a more sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 5.70, which is just 0.6% of its maximum capacity. Maintaining a low hunting intensity is essential to allow the sheep to recover and prevent further depletion. Given the current high wolf population, focusing on competition among wolves rather than aggressive hunting will help ensure both species can survive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 3.12, which is just 0.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting sheep. This will allow the sheep population to recover and create a more sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep by focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting. This will allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a sustainable wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their extinction. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.200 to 0.25, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity. To allow for recovery and ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and competing more with other wolves. This will help the sheep population stabilize and eventually grow, creating a more sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity. Increasing hunting intensity could lead to the extinction of sheep, which would ultimately harm the wolf population as well. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity. Increasing hunting intensity would further deplete the sheep, jeopardizing both their survival and the long-term health of our wolf pack. A moderate approach allows for some hunting while prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population, ensuring a sustainable balance."
