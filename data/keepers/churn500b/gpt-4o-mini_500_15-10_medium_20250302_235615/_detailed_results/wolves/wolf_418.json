            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 168\n- Sheep population: 14.71\n- Wolf population: 201.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.320\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.07 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 1.5% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help maintain a balance between the wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term survival for both. Additionally, with a wolf population of 192, it's wise to focus on competition among wolves rather than aggressive hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep to recover. This lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we are at risk of depleting their numbers further. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help the sheep recover while also allowing our wolf population to stabilize. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 3.12, which is just 0.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that aggressive hunting could lead to the extinction of sheep, jeopardizing the long-term survival of both species. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help achieve this balance without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting would further deplete their numbers and threaten the ecosystem. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population, ensuring long-term survival for both wolves and sheep.",

This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",

This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.30 strikes a balance between competing with other wolves and allowing the sheep population to stabilize, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",

By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while still competing with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",

A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring that both populations can recover sustainably.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity.
