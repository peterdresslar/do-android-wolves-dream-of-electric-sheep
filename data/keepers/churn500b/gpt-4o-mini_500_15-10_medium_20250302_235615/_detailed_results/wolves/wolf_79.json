            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 36\n- Sheep population: 105.71\n- Wolf population: 74.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.039\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 1.43 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 10.6% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.6% of its maximum capacity, and my previous theta was quite low. This suggests that focusing on competition with other wolves is more beneficial at this time to allow the sheep population to recover. A gradual increase in theta will help maintain balance while ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow for recovery. This will help ensure the long-term survival of both species while preventing overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 53.99, which is only 5.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity to 0.35, I can still focus on competition with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 38.10, which is only 3.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. This lower theta will help maintain a balance and prevent over-depletion of the sheep, while also considering the current high wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.87, which is only 2.8% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 2.1% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash in sheep numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and my previous theta of 0.300 was focused on competition with other wolves. Given the sheep population is at only 1.7% of its maximum capacity, I can afford to increase my hunting intensity slightly to help sustain my pack while still allowing the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual increase will help maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.4% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition with other wolves. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 12.00, which is only 1.2% of its maximum capacity. Maintaining a lower theta allows for a focus on competition with other wolves rather than aggressive hunting, giving the sheep a chance to recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the wolf population is relatively high. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help sustain our population while allowing the sheep to recover gradually. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a significant imbalance. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep population to recover while ensuring the long-term survival of both species. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A gradual adjustment towards lower hunting intensity will help maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta will help balance the need for hunting with the necessity of maintaining a sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.09, which is only 0.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are under pressure and need time to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.30 to 0.35, I can still focus on competition with other wolves while allowing for some hunting to support reproduction. This small adjustment helps maintain a balance without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.00, which is only 0.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. Additionally, with a wolf population of 27.00, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low, suggesting that focusing on competition among wolves rather than intense hunting will help maintain balance and ensure the long-term survival of both species."
