            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15, which is only 1.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.40 allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring a balance that promotes long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity to ensure the survival of my pack, I must do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for sustainable hunting while still considering the need for balance with the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.86, which is only 1.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that the sheep need time to recover, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to increase their numbers. Additionally, with a wolf population of 8.00, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.19, which is only 1.9% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a presence in the ecosystem. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting without depleting the sheep population too quickly, supporting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.54, which is only 2.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting to support our wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for sustainable cycles.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.10, which is only 2.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should be cautious with our hunting to allow the sheep to recover. However, with a moderate sheep-to-wolf ratio of 3.68, a slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted to support our wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A theta of 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing our needs.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.70, which is only 2.4% of its maximum capacity. While I want to ensure the survival of my pack, I also recognize the need to allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, allowing both populations to stabilize without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.55, which is only 2.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus more on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This gradual adjustment helps ensure the long-term survival of both species."
