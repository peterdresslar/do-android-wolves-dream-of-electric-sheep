            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep do not deplete too quickly. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid destabilizing the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is necessary to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly and to promote a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 62.70, which is only 6.3% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.86, which is only 3.6% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover while also ensuring the wolf population remains stable, a lower theta value will help reduce hunting intensity and focus on competition with other wolves. This approach supports long-term sustainability and prevents potential crashes in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 2.2% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. A gradual approach will help maintain balance and prevent drastic population crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. This suggests that we need to allow the sheep population to recover while still maintaining a slight focus on hunting to ensure our own survival. A small increase from my previous theta allows for a gradual adjustment that respects the delicate balance of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.9% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover while preventing overcompetition among wolves. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 0.7% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the survival of my pack, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta will enable me to maintain some hunting pressure while still prioritizing the long-term balance of the ecosystem."
