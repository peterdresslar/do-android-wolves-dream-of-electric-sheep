            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 7.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that they need time to recover. A lower theta allows me to focus on competing with other wolves, which will help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to increase. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 53.99, which is only 5.4% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, it is crucial to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help stabilize the sheep population while also managing competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 38.10, which is only 3.8% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the survival of my pack, I must also allow the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will enable me to hunt a bit more effectively while still prioritizing the long-term balance of the ecosystem. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.87, which is only 2.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover rather than intensifying hunting. By maintaining a lower theta, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both the sheep and the wolf population, while also preventing overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.32, which is only 2.1% of its maximum capacity. While I need to focus on hunting to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 1.7% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure and give the sheep a chance to rebound, while also managing competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 1.4% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both species by preventing overhunting and allowing for a more sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 12, which is just 1.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.30 reflects a moderate approach, balancing the need to compete with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to support our population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.1% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we are at risk of depleting our prey. A theta of 0.30 allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach balances the immediate need for sustenance with the long-term goal of ensuring both species can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. This indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover before increasing our hunting intensity. A lower theta will help reduce competition among wolves while giving the sheep a chance to rebound.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the wolf population is relatively high. A moderate hunting intensity will allow for some hunting while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a balance and avoiding sudden changes, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is quite low at 9.09, which is only 0.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are struggling, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to recover. However, since the wolf population is relatively high at 31, I need to ensure that we don",

This lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both species by preventing overhunting and fostering a sustainable balance.",

This indicates that we need to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a slight focus on hunting to support our wolf population. A small increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a gradual adjustment that balances our needs without risking a crash in the sheep population."
