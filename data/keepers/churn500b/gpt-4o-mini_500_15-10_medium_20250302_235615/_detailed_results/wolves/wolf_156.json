            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.7% of maximum capacity, and my previous theta was quite low at 0.036. To allow the sheep to recover while still focusing on competition with other wolves, a moderate increase to 0.25 will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a slight abundance of sheep relative to wolves. By maintaining a moderate hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while still ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and promotes a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 62.70, which is only 6.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for gradual hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.86, which is only 3.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help the sheep population stabilize while ensuring the wolf population does not decline too rapidly. This gradual adjustment will promote a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and my previous theta was already on the lower end. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for a modest increase in hunting intensity to help sustain my pack while still giving sheep a chance to recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding drastic changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 1.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their depletion. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to recover while ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By focusing more on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can allow the sheep population to stabilize and gradually increase. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.9% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a significant scarcity of prey. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing competition with other wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should remain cautious. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population."
