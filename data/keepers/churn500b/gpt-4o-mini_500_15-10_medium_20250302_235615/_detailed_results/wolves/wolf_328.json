            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 16.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 132, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still considering the long-term balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 63.41, which is only 6.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a moderate approach, balancing the need to compete with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to support our population without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 14.71, which is only 1.5% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity and give the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, while also managing competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 5.70, which is only 0.6% of its maximum capacity. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover and increase their numbers, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem. Given the high wolf population, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.3% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and my previous focus on competition has not allowed for sustainable hunting.
