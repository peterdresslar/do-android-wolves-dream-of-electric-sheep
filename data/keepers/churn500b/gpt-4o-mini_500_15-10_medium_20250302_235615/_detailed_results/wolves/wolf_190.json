A gradual increase in theta will be considered as the sheep population grows.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 62.70, which is only 6.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity to 0.35, I can still focus on maintaining a balance between hunting and competing with other wolves, allowing for sustainable coexistence while being mindful of the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.86, which is only 3.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to gradually increase. This approach aligns with the wisdom of ensuring long-term survival and avoiding sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.41, which is only 2.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover, and a slight increase in hunting intensity will allow for some reproduction among wolves while still giving sheep a chance to bounce back. A moderate approach helps maintain balance and prevents over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. This indicates a need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both sheep and wolves, while also allowing for a gradual adjustment as conditions change.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting sheep. This will allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a sustainable wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.9% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A moderate theta value will help maintain a balance that supports sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 7.06, which is only 0.7% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure long-term survival, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting. This lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. A gradual increase from my previous theta will help maintain balance without risking a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A gradual decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and prevent a crash in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their extinction. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep."
