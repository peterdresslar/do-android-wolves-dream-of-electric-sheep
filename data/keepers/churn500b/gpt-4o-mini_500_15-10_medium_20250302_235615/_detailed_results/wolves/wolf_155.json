            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.7% of its maximum capacity, and my previous theta was quite low at 0.126. To allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a focus on competition with other wolves, a moderate theta of 0.3 will help balance hunting and competition, ensuring both populations can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.6% of its maximum capacity, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate increase will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 6.3% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting to sustain the wolf population. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance and avoids over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, at only 3.6% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.41, which is only 2.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that the sheep need time to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.30 to 0.35, I can still maintain some hunting pressure while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help the sheep population grow while also managing competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a potential crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and my previous theta was too focused on hunting. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity, I can help the wolf population recover while still allowing the sheep to gradually bounce back. This approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence and avoids drastic changes that could destabilize the ecosystem."
