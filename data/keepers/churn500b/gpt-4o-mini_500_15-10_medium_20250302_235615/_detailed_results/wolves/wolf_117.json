            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 19.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 21, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure that both populations can thrive. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level (19.0% of maximum capacity), which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. However, given the current wolf population and the need to maintain balance, a moderate approach is prudent to ensure the long-term survival of both species. This adjustment allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment reflects a balanced approach, considering both the current sheep population and the need to maintain a healthy wolf population. It allows for gradual adaptation to the ecosystem",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that can support wolf reproduction while still giving sheep a chance to recover. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to ensure long-term sustainability, as the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a need for balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.6% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 62.70, which is only 6.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to gradually increase, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.86, which is only 3.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. By lowering the hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both the sheep and the wolf population. A gradual approach will allow for a sustainable balance as conditions change.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.41, which is only 2.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a slight hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A small increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep further."
