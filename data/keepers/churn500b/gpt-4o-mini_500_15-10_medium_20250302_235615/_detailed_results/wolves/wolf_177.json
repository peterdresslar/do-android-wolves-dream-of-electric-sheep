            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a slight overpopulation of wolves. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also reducing competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 62.70, which is only 6.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is a need to allow the sheep to recover. By setting theta at 0.30, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, which will help stabilize our population while giving the sheep a chance to increase. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.86, which is only 3.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should be cautious with hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 to 0.35 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for some hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.41, which is only 2.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover rather than intensifying hunting. By maintaining a lower theta, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep while gradually adjusting to the current ecosystem state.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and a gradual increase in hunting intensity is necessary to allow for some recovery while still competing with other wolves. This small adjustment helps maintain a balance between hunting and competition, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a significant competition for resources. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a more balanced approach, enabling some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to replenish while also managing competition among wolves. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable for hunting. Maintaining a lower theta allows the sheep population to recover while preventing overcompetition among wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 5.26, which is only 0.5% of its maximum capacity. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover and ensures that we do not deplete their numbers further. It is crucial to focus on competing with other wolves at this stage to stabilize our own population while allowing the sheep to bounce back."
