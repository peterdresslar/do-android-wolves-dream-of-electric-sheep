            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently healthy at 178, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This value strikes a balance between ensuring the wolf population can thrive while still allowing the sheep to recover and maintain their numbers. It reflects a cautious approach to avoid over-depletion of the sheep, while also recognizing the need for wolves to reproduce.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a balance between wolf reproduction and sheep recovery, ensuring long-term survival for both species. A gradual adjustment is necessary to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly while still allowing for some growth in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for moderate hunting without risking depletion. This balance will help maintain both wolf and sheep populations while allowing for gradual adjustments as conditions change.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 19.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a more cautious approach, focusing on maintaining a balance as the wolf population grows.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing sheep to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, allowing for some recovery while still maintaining a focus on competition with other wolves. This moderate adjustment will help ensure that both populations can thrive in the long term without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.6% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balanced approach. This adjustment will help support the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 6.3% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. A lower theta allows for a focus on competition with other wolves, which can help stabilize our numbers while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.86, which is only 3.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to increase, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the wolf population is relatively high. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a modest hunting intensity that can help sustain my pack while still giving the sheep a chance to recover.
