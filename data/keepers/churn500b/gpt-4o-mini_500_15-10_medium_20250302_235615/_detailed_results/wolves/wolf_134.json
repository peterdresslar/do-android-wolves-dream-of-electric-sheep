        "explanations": [
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for increased hunting intensity without risking depletion. However, I must remain cautious and avoid overhunting, as the wolf population is also growing. A moderate increase in theta will help sustain both populations while allowing for some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly, and this theta reflects a balanced approach to coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level (14.7% of maximum capacity), allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sustainability. This value balances the need to hunt effectively without depleting the sheep population too quickly, ensuring long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term survival of both species. This adjustment helps maintain a balance as the wolf population is also relatively high, and I want to ensure that we do not deplete the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 62.70, which is only 6.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own population. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity, giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, while still allowing for some competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 3.6% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while still competing with other wolves. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.41, which is only 2.2% of its maximum capacity. While I need to focus on hunting to ensure the survival of my pack, I must also be cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low at 0.13. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a significant imbalance. By reducing my hunting intensity further, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing the competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable ecosystem."
