            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.3% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are more sheep available per wolf. This suggests that a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while also reducing competition among wolves. A gradual approach will help maintain balance and ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 63.41, which is only 6.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I need to be cautious about hunting too aggressively, a slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted to help maintain my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 14.71, which is only 1.5% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity and give the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, while also allowing the wolf population to stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 5.70, which is only 0.6% of its maximum capacity. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover and ensures the long-term survival of both species. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.03, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 3.12, which is only 0.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on competing with other wolves rather than hunting sheep. This lower intensity will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent further depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. This indicates that aggressive hunting could lead to the complete depletion of the sheep population, which would ultimately threaten our own survival. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.20 to 0.25, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity. With such a small number of sheep, it is essential to focus on reducing competition among wolves rather than intensifying hunting. This will allow the sheep population a chance to recover, ensuring long-term survival for both species."
