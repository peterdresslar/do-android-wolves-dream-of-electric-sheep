            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.6% of maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a slight overpopulation of wolves. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 62.70, which is only 6.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased slightly, it is crucial to maintain a cautious approach to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate increase to 0.35 reflects a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.86, which is only 3.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid sudden population crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.41, which is only 2.2% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will enable me to hunt a bit more effectively while still prioritizing the long-term balance of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help ensure a sustainable balance in the ecosystem while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 0.9% of its maximum capacity, which indicates that aggressive hunting could lead to their depletion. By maintaining a moderate theta, I can focus on competition with other wolves while allowing the sheep population a chance to recover. This approach supports the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and my previous theta of 0.300 was focused on competition with other wolves. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to slightly increase my hunting intensity to help stabilize the sheep population while still being cautious not to deplete them further. This gradual adjustment allows for a more sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 0.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that aggressive hunting could lead to a rapid decline in sheep, jeopardizing the long-term survival of both species. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting sheep. This will help balance the populations over time.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to rebound while still competing with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for sheep recovery. Maintaining a theta of 0.30 will help ensure the long-term survival of both species while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep."
