            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.71, which is only 2.3% of its maximum capacity. While my previous theta of 0.706 indicates a strong hunting approach, I need to shift towards a more balanced strategy to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.5 will help maintain a sustainable coexistence while still allowing for some hunting to support the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 6.27, which is only 0.6% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting sheep. This will allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while preventing overcompetition among wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and focuses on long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.4% of its maximum capacity, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash."
