            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I need to maintain a healthy wolf population, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A moderate hunting intensity will help balance our needs without depleting the sheep further, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population, which would ultimately harm the wolf population as well.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.8% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover while preventing further depletion. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 6.27, which is only 0.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderate to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to sustain itself. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity and give sheep a chance to rebound, while also addressing the competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.4% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. A gradual decrease in theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.4% of its maximum capacity, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population. A moderate theta will help balance competition among wolves and give sheep a chance to increase their numbers without depleting their population further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to rebound while also considering the growing wolf population. This balance helps ensure the long-term survival of both species."
