            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.1% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are more sheep available relative to wolves. This suggests that a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while also reducing competition among wolves. Gradually increasing my hunting intensity is important, but I must prioritize long-term sustainability over immediate gains.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the wolf population is relatively high. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also reducing competition among wolves. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem."
