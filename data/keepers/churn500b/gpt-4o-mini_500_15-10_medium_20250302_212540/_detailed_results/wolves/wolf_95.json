            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 57, which is only 5.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to rebuild their numbers. Additionally, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.59, focusing on competition among wolves rather than intense hunting will help stabilize our population while ensuring the sheep can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 3.6% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain balance and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a presence in the ecosystem. A slight increase from my previous theta will help balance my needs with the health of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 0.4% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting sheep. This lower theta will help balance the populations and prevent further depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 4.33, which is only 0.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover, and focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to stabilize while preventing overhunting. A gradual increase in theta will help maintain a balance as conditions change."
