            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 83.47, which is only 8.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is potential for recovery if I focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting sheep. A gradual increase in theta will allow for a more sustainable balance as the sheep population recovers, while still keeping an eye on the wolf population dynamics.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and ensures the long-term survival of both species."
