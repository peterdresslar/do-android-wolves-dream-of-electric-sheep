            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 83.47, which is only 8.3% of its maximum capacity. While I need to maintain a balance to ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, a moderate hunting intensity will allow for some reproduction among wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of making gradual adjustments based on current population trends.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable for sustainable hunting. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing competition with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.4% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low at 0.11. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both species by preventing overhunting and allowing for a more sustainable balance."
