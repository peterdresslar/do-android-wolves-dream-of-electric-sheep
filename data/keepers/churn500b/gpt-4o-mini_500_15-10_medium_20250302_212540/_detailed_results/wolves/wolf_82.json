            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 57, which is only 5.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to increase, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 4.37, which is only 0.4% of its maximum capacity. Given the high wolf population of 40, it is crucial to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A theta of 0.30 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for wolves to survive while giving sheep a chance to rebound.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 0.4% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep population to recover while also preventing overcompetition among wolves. This balance is essential for the long-term survival of both species."
