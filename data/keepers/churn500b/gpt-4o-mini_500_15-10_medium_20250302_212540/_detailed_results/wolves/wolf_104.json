            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.93, which is only 3.6% of its maximum capacity. While I want to increase hunting to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.6 allows for some hunting while still considering the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to replenish their numbers while also addressing the competition among wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 5.31, which is only 0.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are in a vulnerable state, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to their further decline. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 to 0.35 allows for a cautious approach to hunting while still considering the need for wolf reproduction. This balance helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I need to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that considers both the current sheep population and the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 7.03, which is only 0.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 to 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 7.59, which is only 0.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 8.22, which is only 0.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a moderate approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I need to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery.
