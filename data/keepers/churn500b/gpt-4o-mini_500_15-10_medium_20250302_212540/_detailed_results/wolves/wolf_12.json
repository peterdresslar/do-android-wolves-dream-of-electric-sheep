            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the sheep-to-wolf ratio being quite high, I can afford to maintain a moderate hunting intensity to ensure both the wolf population remains healthy and the sheep can recover. This adjustment allows for gradual adaptation to the ecosystem",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that can help sustain both the wolf and sheep populations. This value reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for hunting with the importance of allowing the sheep to recover. It also considers the current wolf population, which is relatively stable, and avoids sudden changes that could disrupt the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 14.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with a wolf population of 10, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment helps support wolf reproduction without risking a rapid decline in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.7% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite high at 3.76. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, a more moderate approach will allow for the sheep to recover while still ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. Gradually adjusting my hunting intensity will help maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.1% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 83.47, which is only 8.3% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and avoid depleting their numbers further, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting. This moderate approach will help maintain a balance while ensuring the long-term survival of both species."
