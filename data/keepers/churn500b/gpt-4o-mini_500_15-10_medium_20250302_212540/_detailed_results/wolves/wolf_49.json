            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.3% of its maximum capacity, and my previous theta was quite low at 0.158. To allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining some hunting, I will gradually increase my hunting intensity. This approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.71, which is only 2.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also maintaining our wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.25 allows for some hunting, but not enough to deplete the sheep further. This balanced approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 1.0% of its maximum capacity, which necessitates a focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow for recovery. With the current sheep-to-wolf ratio at 0.13, it is essential to prioritize the long-term survival of both species by allowing the sheep to rebound. A gradual decrease in hunting will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem."
