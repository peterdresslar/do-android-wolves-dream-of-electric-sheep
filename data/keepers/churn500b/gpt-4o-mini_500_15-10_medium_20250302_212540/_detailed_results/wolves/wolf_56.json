            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.3% of its maximum capacity, and my previous theta was quite low. To allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a focus on competition with other wolves, a gradual increase in theta is appropriate. This will help ensure a sustainable balance without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 57, which is only 5.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover, and focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to regain their numbers while preventing overhunting. A gradual increase in theta can be considered later as the sheep population improves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.93, which is only 3.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.30 to 0.35, I can still maintain a focus on competition with other wolves while allowing for a small increase in hunting that won",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.8% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 5.30, which is 0.5% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting sheep. This will allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a healthier balance in the wolf population."
