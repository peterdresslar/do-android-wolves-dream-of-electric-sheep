            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep do not become overly depleted. A gradual increase aligns with the current trends and promotes a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level (15.4% of maximum capacity), which allows for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This value balances the need for sustainable coexistence while still allowing for some hunting to support the wolf population. It reflects a cautious approach, considering the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need to adapt to changing conditions."
