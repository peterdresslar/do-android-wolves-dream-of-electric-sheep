            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively low at 57, which allows for some increased hunting intensity without risking immediate depletion. However, given the current wolf population of 96, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure long-term sustainability. A moderate increase to 0.75 strikes a balance between hunting and allowing the sheep population to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.93, which is only 3.6% of its maximum capacity. While I need to maintain hunting to support wolf reproduction, I must also be cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting. This will help balance the wolf population without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. This lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population, which is essential for the future of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting sheep. This will allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a sustainable wolf population."
