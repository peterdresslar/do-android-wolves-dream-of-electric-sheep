            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 3.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that a more moderate hunting intensity is necessary to allow the sheep to recover. By setting theta at 0.45, I can maintain a balance that supports both the wolf population and the sheep, ensuring long-term sustainability without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.71, which is only 2.3% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a focus on competition with other wolves, a lower theta value of 0.35 strikes a balance. This approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both species without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we are competing for limited resources. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem."
