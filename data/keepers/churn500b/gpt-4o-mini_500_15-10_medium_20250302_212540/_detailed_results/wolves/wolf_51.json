            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 132.80, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. While I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. A moderate increase to 0.73 allows for sustainable hunting while still considering the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 57, which is only 5.7% of its maximum capacity. While my previous theta of 0.730 was effective for hunting, it is now prudent to moderate my hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. A theta of 0.60 strikes a balance between hunting and allowing for sheep population growth, ensuring long-term sustainability for both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. This lower theta will help balance the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population, which is essential for the sustainability of my pack."
