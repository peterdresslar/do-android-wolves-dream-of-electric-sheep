            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 14.95, which is only 1.5% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover while also managing the wolf population. A lower theta value will help reduce competition among wolves and give sheep a chance to increase their numbers, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 7.85, which is only 0.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure on the sheep, giving them a chance to increase their numbers while also allowing the wolf population to stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By focusing more on competition with other wolves rather than hunting sheep, I can help the sheep population stabilize and gradually increase. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes that could lead to crashes in either population.",
