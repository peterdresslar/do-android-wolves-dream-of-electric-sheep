            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15, which is only 1.5% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. This will help balance the ecosystem and prevent over-depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still considering the need for sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the wolf population is relatively high. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while reducing competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.01, which is only 2.0% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, a slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted to take advantage of the current sheep availability. However, I must be cautious and avoid overhunting, as this could lead to a depletion of the sheep population and ultimately harm both species in the long term. A gradual increase allows for adaptation to the current conditions while maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.53, which is only 2.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more moderate hunting approach is necessary to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain its health. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for some hunting intensity without risking the depletion of the sheep population."
