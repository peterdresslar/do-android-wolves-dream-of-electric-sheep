            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I need to maintain a healthy wolf population, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A moderate hunting intensity will help balance the needs of both species without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By focusing more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting sheep, I can allow the sheep population to stabilize and grow, ensuring long-term survival for both species. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 0.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to increase. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid sudden population crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the wolf population is relatively high. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and promotes long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 4.12, which is just 0.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover before increasing hunting intensity. A lower theta will help reduce competition among wolves while giving the sheep a chance to rebound, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.4% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are not enough sheep to sustain intense hunting. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to recover while ensuring the long-term survival of both species."
