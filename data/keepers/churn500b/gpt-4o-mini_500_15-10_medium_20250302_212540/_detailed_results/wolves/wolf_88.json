            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting sheep. This will allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.4% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. This indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover rather than intensifying hunting. A gradual increase in theta will help maintain a balance while still considering the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and my previous theta was already on the lower end. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for a modest increase in hunting intensity to help sustain my pack while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep further. This gradual adjustment aligns with the need to maintain a balance in the ecosystem."
