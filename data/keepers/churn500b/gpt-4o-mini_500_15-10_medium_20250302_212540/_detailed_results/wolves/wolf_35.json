            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 36\n- Sheep population: 111.33\n- Wolf population: 68.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.178\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 1.64 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 11.1% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.1% of maximum capacity, and my previous theta was quite low. To allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a focus on competition with other wolves, a slight increase to 0.25 will help balance my needs without overexploiting the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 83.47, which is only 8.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover rather than intensifying hunting. A moderate theta of 0.30 will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can grow, promoting long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.71, which is only 2.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a slight focus on hunting to support our wolf population. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.30 to 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for sustenance with the long-term health of both species."
