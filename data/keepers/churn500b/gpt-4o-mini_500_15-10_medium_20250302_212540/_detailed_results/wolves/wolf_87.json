            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.4% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. This indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.4 allows for some hunting to support our reproduction while not overexploiting the sheep, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.4% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. A gradual adjustment to 0.35 maintains a focus on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, promoting a sustainable balance."
