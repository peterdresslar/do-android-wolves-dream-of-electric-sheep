            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 83.47, which is only 8.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.386 to 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need to compete with other wolves while still allowing sheep to rebound.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 57, which is only 5.7% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population, while also managing competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover while preventing overcompetition among wolves. This balance is crucial for the long-term survival of both species."
