            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.1% of maximum capacity, allowing for a gradual increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate approach will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations while allowing for recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 57, which is only 5.7% of its maximum capacity. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while also addressing the competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.93, which is only 3.6% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will enable me to hunt more effectively while still prioritizing the sustainability of both populations. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a significant imbalance. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing competition with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and ensures the long-term survival of both species."
