            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 63\n- Sheep population: 8.22\n- Wolf population: 4.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.400\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 2.06 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 0.8% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.93, which is only 3.6% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting intensely. This will help balance the populations and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their depletion. By setting theta at 0.30, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and my previous theta was already on the lower end. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach to hunting while still being cautious about the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.4% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing competition with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and promote a healthier balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.4% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low at 0.22. This indicates that the sheep are struggling, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to their depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population, ensuring a more sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to replenish while also managing competition with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a bit more hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help the sheep population rebound while ensuring our own survival in the long run. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I need to focus on hunting to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity slightly to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 7.03, which is only 0.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover rather than intensifying our hunting. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 to 0.35 reflects a cautious approach to balance competition with other wolves while still considering the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 7.59, which is only 0.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is an opportunity to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A gradual increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while recognizing the need for wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I want to ensure the survival of my pack, I also recognize the need to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate approach will help maintain balance and prevent overhunting, ensuring both populations can thrive in the long term."
