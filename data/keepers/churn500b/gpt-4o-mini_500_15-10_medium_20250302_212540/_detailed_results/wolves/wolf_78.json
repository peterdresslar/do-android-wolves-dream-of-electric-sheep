            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.71, which is only 2.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a moderate approach, balancing the need to compete with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population. This gradual adjustment will help ensure long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep to recover. This lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.4% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting."
