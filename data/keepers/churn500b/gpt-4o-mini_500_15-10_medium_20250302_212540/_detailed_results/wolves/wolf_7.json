            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.7% of maximum capacity, indicating that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. This will help ensure the long-term survival of both our wolf pack and the sheep, avoiding overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still considering the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, allowing for some hunting without risking depletion. However, with the wolf population at 10, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery. A moderate increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that avoids over-depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.1% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we have a sufficient number of sheep relative to wolves. By lowering my hunting intensity slightly, I can allow the sheep population to recover while still competing with other wolves. This approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species and maintains a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 83.47, which is only 8.3% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still being cautious. A gradual increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for some hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly. It also considers the current wolf population, which is slightly higher than the sheep population, suggesting a need for sustainable coexistence."
