To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep population. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition with other wolves. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",

Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover while also managing competition with other wolves. This approach aligns with my objective of ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should remain cautious to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance while still considering the need for wolves to thrive.",

To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. This lower theta will help maintain a balance and prevent further depletion of the sheep, while also considering the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution in hunting.

This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
