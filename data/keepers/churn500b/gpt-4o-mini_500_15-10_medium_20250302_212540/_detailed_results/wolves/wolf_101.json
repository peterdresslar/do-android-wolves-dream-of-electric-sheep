            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution in hunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a gradual response to the sheep population while still prioritizing the competition with other wolves. This approach aims to prevent over-depletion of the sheep and supports a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to rebound. A gradual approach is essential to avoid sudden changes that could disrupt the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we need to be cautious in our hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support our population while still prioritizing the sustainability of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we are nearing a critical point. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can allow the sheep population to recover while ensuring the long-term survival of both species. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
