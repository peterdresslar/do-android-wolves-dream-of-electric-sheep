A moderate theta value will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.53, which is only 2.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is an opportunity to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A gradual increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while responding to the current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.10, which is only 2.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
