            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 35\n- Sheep population: 132.80\n- Wolf population: 52.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.981\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 2.55 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 13.3% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This will help sustain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover gradually.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 7.85, which is only 0.8% of its maximum capacity. While I need to maintain a balance to ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I can afford to increase my hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction. However, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly, so a moderate increase to 0.70 allows for sustainable coexistence."
