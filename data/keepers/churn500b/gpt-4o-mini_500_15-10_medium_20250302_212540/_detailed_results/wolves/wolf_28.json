            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 83.47, which is only 8.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for the sheep to recover. By adopting a moderate hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to stabilize while still ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.71, which is only 2.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the long-term survival of both species, ensuring that the wolf population can stabilize without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep population. By focusing more on competing with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a stable wolf population."
