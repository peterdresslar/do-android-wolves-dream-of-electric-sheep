            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.71, which is only 2.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.25 reflects a cautious approach, focusing more on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. This suggests that focusing on competition with other wolves is more prudent at this time, allowing the sheep population to recover. A gradual increase in theta will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep further."
