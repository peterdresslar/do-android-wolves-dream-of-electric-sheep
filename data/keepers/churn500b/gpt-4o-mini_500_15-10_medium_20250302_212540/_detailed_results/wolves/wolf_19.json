            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.93, which is only 3.6% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while maintaining a healthy wolf population. A lower theta value will help reduce hunting intensity and give the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, while still allowing for some competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.71, which is only 2.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain a balance and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A gradual reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain a sustainable balance."
