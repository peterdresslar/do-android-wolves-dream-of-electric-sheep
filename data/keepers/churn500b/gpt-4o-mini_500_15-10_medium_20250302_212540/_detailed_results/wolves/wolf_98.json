            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. Focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to recover while we maintain our numbers. A gradual approach is essential to avoid sudden crashes in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and my previous theta was too focused on hunting. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity, I can help the wolf population grow while still allowing the sheep to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.5% of maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their depletion. By maintaining a moderate theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 4.99, which is only 0.5% of its maximum capacity. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover and increase their numbers, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem. Given the current wolf population, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 5.31, which is only 0.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are in a vulnerable state, and increasing hunting intensity too much could lead to their depletion. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach, enabling me to focus on both hunting and the competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species."
