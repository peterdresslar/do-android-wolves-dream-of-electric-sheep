            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 7.85, which is only 0.8% of its maximum capacity. While I need to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. A theta of 0.75 allows for a moderate increase in hunting while still considering the long-term sustainability of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 0.6% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta value will help balance competition among wolves and give sheep a chance to increase their numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 4.72, which is only 0.5% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting. This lower theta will help balance the populations and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.4% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.4% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta will help balance hunting with competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the survival of my pack, I must also allow the sheep to recover.
