            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 11.8% of maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain a healthy wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover gradually. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of making small changes in response to population dynamics.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for moderate hunting without risking depletion. By maintaining a balance, I can ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep while adapting to the current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 15.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with a wolf population of 14, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite high, suggesting that we should be cautious about overhunting. A slight decrease in hunting intensity allows for a sustainable balance, giving sheep a chance to recover while still enabling wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term survival of both species. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to ensure that the sheep can recover while also allowing for some growth in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 83.47, which is only 8.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and allowing the sheep population to stabilize, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 57, which is only 5.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while allowing the sheep population to stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.93, which is only 3.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will enable me to maintain some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term survival of both species. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance."
