            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 83.47, which is only 8.3% of its maximum capacity. While I need to maintain a healthy wolf population, I can afford to increase my hunting intensity slightly to support reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A theta of 0.75 allows for a more aggressive approach to hunting while still being mindful of the need for balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 6.27, which is only 0.6% of its maximum capacity. While I need to maintain a balance between hunting and competing with other wolves, a moderate increase in hunting intensity is warranted to ensure the survival of my pack. However, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly, so a theta of 0.60 allows for sustainable hunting while still considering the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing the competition among wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem."
