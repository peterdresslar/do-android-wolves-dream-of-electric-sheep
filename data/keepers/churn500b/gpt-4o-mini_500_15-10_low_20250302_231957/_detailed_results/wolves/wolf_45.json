            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and reduce competition for the remaining sheep. This approach increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, which means food is scarcer. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with the wolf population also declining, it\u2019s crucial to conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively. A moderate intensity allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey while still participating in the hunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a scarcity of food. With fewer sheep and a declining wolf population, it\u2019s wise to conserve energy and hunt at a lower intensity. This approach allows me to survive longer while still participating in hunts when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can strike a balance between conserving energy and ensuring I have enough food to survive. This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity while still being competitive.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the wolf population is also declining. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are likely to hunt at maximum intensity. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while avoiding overexertion, which could lead to unnecessary risks. This approach allows me to adapt to the current situation without pushing myself to the limits.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the number of wolves, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves and potential failure. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, while the wolf population has decreased. A moderate hunting intensity allows me to balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion in a competitive environment. This way, I can still contribute to my survival without exhausting myself or risking confrontation with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, while the wolf population has decreased significantly. A lower hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still taking advantage of the available prey. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity. By choosing a theta of 0.50, I can balance my need for food with the risk of overexerting myself in a competitive environment where other wolves are also hunting. This way, I can ensure my survival while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the population of wolves has decreased, indicating increased competition for food. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid attracting attention from other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively when necessary. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition is less intense. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while conserving energy and avoiding overexertion in a potentially unstable environment.",

            "I chose this theta because with the decrease in the wolf population, it is crucial to balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion. A moderate intensity allows me to hunt effectively while conserving energy for future hunts, especially since the sheep population has increased.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting. However, with the recent decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food while also conserving energy for future hunts. A theta of 0.70 allows me to be more aggressive than before while still being cautious.",
            "I chose this theta because with 30.87 sheep and 7 wolves, the competition for food is high. By reducing my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",

            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased significantly, which means competition for food will be higher. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexerting myself in a potentially scarce food environment. This strategy allows me to survive longer while waiting for a better opportunity to hunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, balancing the need to secure food without overexerting myself in a crowded environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and with the recent increase in wolves, competition for food will be fierce.
