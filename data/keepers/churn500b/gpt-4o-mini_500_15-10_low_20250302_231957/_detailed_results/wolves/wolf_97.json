By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion. This allows me to remain competitive with other wolves while still conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making them a scarcer resource. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching enough food while still being mindful of the increased competition from other wolves. A balance is necessary to ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",

By increasing my intensity slightly from my previous theta, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive situation with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population decreasing, it's important to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. A lower intensity allows me to adapt to the changing environment and avoid overexertion, which could be detrimental if the sheep continue to decline.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my intensity to 0.75, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival as the competition with other wolves remains constant.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating that hunting may be less successful.
