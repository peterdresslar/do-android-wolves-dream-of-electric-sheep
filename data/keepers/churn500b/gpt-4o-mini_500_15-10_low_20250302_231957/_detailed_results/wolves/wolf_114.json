It also reduces the risk of overhunting, which could lead to food scarcity in the future. Balancing my needs with the current situation is crucial for survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting more challenging. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts. This strategy increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with the number of wolves remaining the same, hunting at maximum intensity may lead to overexploitation of the remaining sheep. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and ensure that I have enough resources for future hunts while still contributing to the pack's survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, which means hunting may be less rewarding. By increasing my intensity slightly from 0.45 to 0.55, I can adapt to the current situation and still maintain a competitive edge without overexerting myself, ensuring my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, which means food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can maximize my chances of catching enough food while still being mindful of the competition from other wolves. A theta of 0.65 allows me to be more aggressive without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success.",
