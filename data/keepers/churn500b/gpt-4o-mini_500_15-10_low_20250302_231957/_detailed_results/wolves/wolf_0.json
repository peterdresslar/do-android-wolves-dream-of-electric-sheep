            "I chose this theta because with 15 sheep and 10 wolves, the competition for food is high. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a situation where resources are limited."
