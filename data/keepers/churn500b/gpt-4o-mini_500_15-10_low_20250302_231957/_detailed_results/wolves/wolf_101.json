            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a more cautious approach. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are likely to hunt aggressively. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a fluctuating environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the number of wolves. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the available prey without overexerting myself or risking competition with other wolves. A moderate approach allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population means competition for food is rising. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance allows me to survive without overexerting myself, especially with the sheep population not increasing as rapidly.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the current situation without overexerting myself, which could lead to exhaustion or injury. This balance allows me to contribute to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and increase my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. By increasing my intensity slightly to 0.60, I can take advantage of the higher prey availability while still conserving energy compared to maximum intensity. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. With an increase in the wolf population, hunting at maximum intensity may lead to competition and overexploitation of the remaining sheep. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's efforts, ensuring my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and reduce competition for the remaining sheep. This strategy allows me to survive longer while waiting for a better opportunity.",
            "I chose this theta because with the increase in the wolf population, competition for food is likely to be higher. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, balancing the need to secure food without overexerting myself in a potentially crowded hunting scenario.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With an increase in the wolf population, competition for food will be higher, so a lower intensity will help conserve energy while still allowing for opportunistic hunting. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating that hunting may be less successful if I go all out. By choosing a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt, balancing my survival with the need to compete with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating less food availability. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and failure. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to hunt effectively while conserving energy, as the competition with other wolves remains constant. This approach allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of catching enough prey while still being mindful of the competition with other wolves. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the wolf population has increased. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and increases my chances of survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By adjusting my hunting intensity to a moderate level, I can conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the population of sheep is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can take advantage of the available prey while still being cautious, as the recent decrease in the wolf population indicates competition for food is increasing. This balanced approach helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition is less intense, allowing me to hunt with a bit more intensity without risking overexertion. A theta of 0.75 balances the need for food with the caution required in a declining wolf population.",
