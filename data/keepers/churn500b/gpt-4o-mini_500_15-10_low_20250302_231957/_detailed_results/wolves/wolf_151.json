This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and increases my chances of survival in the long run.",

            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and I need to increase my hunting intensity to secure enough food for survival. However, I must be cautious not to overexert myself, as the trend shows a decrease in the wolf population, indicating that competition is fierce.",

            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating that food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy. This balance is crucial for my survival, especially with the recent decline in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the wolf population is still high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the population of sheep is still relatively high, and I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure my survival without depleting the resources too quickly. By increasing my intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the current sheep population while being cautious about the declining number of wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, which presents a good opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition is high. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can take advantage of the available prey while still being cautious about the risks of overexertion in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and reduce the risk of confrontation with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, but the wolf population has also decreased. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still taking advantage of the available prey. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. With the recent decrease in the wolf population, it's important to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still compete for food while also conserving energy for survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, while the wolf population has decreased. This suggests that there may be less competition for food, allowing me to hunt at a lower intensity and conserve energy. A theta of 0.40 balances the need to hunt effectively while also considering the recent trends in both prey and predator populations.",
