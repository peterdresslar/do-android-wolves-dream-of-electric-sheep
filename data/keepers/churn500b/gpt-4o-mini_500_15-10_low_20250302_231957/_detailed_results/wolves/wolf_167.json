            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased slightly, and the number of wolves has increased. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still contributing to the pack's overall success. This balance helps ensure my survival in a changing environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population means competition for food is rising. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because with the increase in the wolf population, competition for food is likely to intensify. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can better secure food for myself while still being mindful of the sheep population, which has decreased slightly. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, I need to conserve energy and avoid competition for food. A moderate intensity allows me to hunt effectively while minimizing risk.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means hunting intensity should be moderated to ensure sustainability. With the number of wolves remaining constant, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still contributing to the pack's survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and with 20 wolves competing for food, a moderate hunting intensity will allow me to conserve energy while still increasing my chances of a successful hunt. This way, I can adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself."
