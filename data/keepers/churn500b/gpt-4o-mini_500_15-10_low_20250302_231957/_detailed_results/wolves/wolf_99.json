            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making them more scarce. With an increase in the wolf population, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential failure. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt, ensuring my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating less food availability. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt if the opportunity arises. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting might be less successful. By increasing my intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the remaining sheep while still conserving energy for future hunts, ensuring my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means hunting intensity needs to be adjusted to ensure sustainability. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the current situation while still being cautious, as the wolf population remains stable. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexploiting the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that food is becoming scarcer. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are likely to hunt at maximum intensity. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can better compete with other wolves for the available resources while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can maximize my chances of catching enough food while still conserving energy. This balance is crucial for my survival, especially with the other wolves also competing for the same resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.5, I can conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. This balanced approach allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself, ensuring my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the wolf population is also declining. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the number of wolves, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves for the same prey. By choosing a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still increasing my chances of catching enough food without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the number of wolves, and hunting at a lower intensity increases my chances of survival by conserving energy and reducing competition with other wolves. A more cautious approach allows me to adapt to the current situation and wait for a better opportunity.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, with the recent decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food while conserving energy and avoiding overexertion. A moderate intensity of 0.50 allows me to be effective without risking too much in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the population of sheep has increased slightly, while the number of wolves has decreased. This suggests that competition for food is becoming more intense. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.30, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's needs. This strategy may help ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
