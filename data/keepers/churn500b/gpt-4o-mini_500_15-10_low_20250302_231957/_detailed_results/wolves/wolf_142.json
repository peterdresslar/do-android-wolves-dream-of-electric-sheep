            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can better compete with the other wolves while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with an increase in the wolf population, competition for food is higher. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.40, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt, ensuring I have enough resources without overexerting myself in a crowded environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population increasing and the number of wolves remaining stable, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to balance the need for food while minimizing competition with other wolves. This way, I can ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts, balancing the need for survival with the current competition from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity may lead to competition and exhaustion. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity from 0.60 to 0.75, I can improve my chances of successfully hunting while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased while the number of wolves has increased. A lower hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves for limited prey. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making food scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still being mindful of the competition from other wolves.
