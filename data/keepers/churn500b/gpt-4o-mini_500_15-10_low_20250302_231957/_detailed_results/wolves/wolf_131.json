By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can maximize my chances of securing enough food while still being cautious, as other wolves may also be competing for the same resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with the wolf population stable, competition for food will be high. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively if opportunities arise. This balanced approach helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that food is becoming scarcer. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.40, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are likely hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to survive longer while waiting for better opportunities.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population decreasing, I need to increase my hunting intensity to ensure I can secure enough food for survival. However, I must also be cautious not to overexert myself, as the wolf population remains stable, and competition for food could increase if other wolves also decide to hunt more aggressively.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting may be less fruitful. By increasing my intensity slightly from my previous theta of 0.60, I can maximize my chances of catching enough food while still being mindful of the overall competition with other wolves.",
