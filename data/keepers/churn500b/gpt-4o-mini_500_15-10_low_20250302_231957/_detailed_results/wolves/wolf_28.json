            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making hunting more challenging. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's efforts. This balance increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the increase in wolves means competition for food is higher. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.5, I can conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, balancing the need to survive with the current scarcity of prey.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting more challenging. However, with an increase in the wolf population, I need to be more competitive to secure food. A theta of 0.70 allows me to hunt effectively while conserving some energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and reduce competition for the remaining sheep. This balanced approach increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less viable. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, ensuring my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while being cautious not to overexert myself in a dwindling population of prey and competitors. This way, I can still secure enough resources without risking my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the number of wolves, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves for the limited prey. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still being cautious, as overexerting myself could lead to exhaustion or injury. This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the current situation and increase my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the overall population of wolves is also declining. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, which presents a better opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. Given that the wolf population has decreased, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still compete for food while conserving energy for survival. A moderate intensity allows me to adapt to the current situation and avoid the risk of depleting resources too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the decreased wolf population. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival while still being able to hunt effectively when necessary."
