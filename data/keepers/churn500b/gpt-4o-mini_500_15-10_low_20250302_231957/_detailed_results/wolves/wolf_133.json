This strategy helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the current situation without overexerting myself, ensuring I have enough energy for future hunts as the wolf population grows.",

By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can better secure my share of the sheep while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a more competitive environment.",

By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can better secure my share of the sheep while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a growing pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can improve my chances of securing enough food while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a growing pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts. This strategy increases my chances of survival by avoiding competition with other wolves for limited prey.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population means more competition for the available sheep. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, while still contributing to the pack's overall success. This strategy allows me to survive longer in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. However, the increase in the wolf population suggests competition for food is rising. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can better secure food while still being cautious not to overexert myself, as resources are limited.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. With more wolves in the area, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and overexploitation of the remaining sheep. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and wait for a better opportunity to hunt when the sheep population stabilizes.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making them more scarce. With an increase in the wolf population, competition for food will be higher. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of catching enough food while still conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the increase in the wolf population means competition for food is higher. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating less food availability. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy, as the competition with other wolves remains constant.",

            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the overall wolf population is also declining.
