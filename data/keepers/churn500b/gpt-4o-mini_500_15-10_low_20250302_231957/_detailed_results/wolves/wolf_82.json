By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with the wolf population remaining the same, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to overexploitation of the remaining sheep. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's survival.",
