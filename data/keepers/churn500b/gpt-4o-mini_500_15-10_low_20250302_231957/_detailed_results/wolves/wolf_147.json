            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. With more wolves around, I need to be cautious and conserve energy while still being prepared to hunt if the opportunity arises. A slightly higher intensity than before allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, I need to balance my energy expenditure and avoid competition. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased while the number of wolves has increased. By adjusting my hunting intensity to a moderate level, I can balance my energy expenditure with the need to hunt effectively without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey without overexerting myself, which is crucial given the current balance of sheep and wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and wasted energy. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion. This way, I can still contribute to my survival without exhausting myself completely, especially since the wolf population remains stable.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating less food availability. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the available resources without overexerting myself, which is crucial for my survival. A balanced approach allows me to adapt to the competition while still being effective in hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the wolf population is also declining. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competing too aggressively with other wolves for the dwindling sheep. This strategy may help ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can contribute to the pack's success while also conserving energy for future hunts. This balanced approach helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a declining wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, allowing me to survive longer while waiting for a more favorable situation.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased slightly, and the wolf population has also dropped significantly. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.40, I can take advantage of the current situation while still being cautious. This allows me to secure enough food without overexerting myself, considering the overall decline in prey and competition.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, with the recent decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still compete with other wolves while also conserving energy for future hunts. A theta of 0.60 allows me to take advantage of the current sheep population without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the number of wolves, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves for the same prey. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition, increasing my chances of survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, which presents a good opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests competition is fierce. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can take advantage of the sheep while still being cautious about the risks posed by other wolves. This balanced approach helps ensure my survival.",
