            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and reduce competition for the remaining prey. This balance allows me to adapt to the current situation while still contributing to the pack's survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. With an increase in the wolf population, hunting at full intensity may lead to competition and overexploitation of the remaining sheep. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves while still contributing to the hunt when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and failure to catch prey. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and adapt to the changing environment while still being able to hunt effectively.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, which means hunting might be less successful at maximum intensity. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly to 0.60, I can take advantage of the current situation while still conserving energy for future hunts, ensuring my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the wolf population is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making them scarcer. Increasing my hunting intensity slightly to 0.60 allows me to take advantage of the current situation without overexerting myself, as the increase in wolves means competition is rising. This balance helps ensure my survival while still being mindful of the risks.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, and the number of wolves remains high. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt, allowing for a more sustainable approach that balances my needs with the current prey availability.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the population of sheep is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and I need to balance my energy expenditure with the need to hunt effectively. By increasing my intensity to 0.50, I can take advantage of the sheep population while conserving some energy for future hunts, especially given the recent decline in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and increases my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can catch enough food while also conserving energy. By increasing my intensity from 0.30 to 0.50, I can be more competitive without overexerting myself, especially since the trend shows a decrease in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the decreased number of wolves. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still contributing to the pack's survival. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and ensure my own survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, and with fewer wolves around, I can afford to hunt at a moderate intensity. This balance allows me to conserve energy while still taking advantage of the available prey, ensuring my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition is less intense, allowing me to hunt with moderate intensity to ensure my survival while conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, but the wolf population has decreased. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still taking advantage of the available prey. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, indicating more food availability. However, with the number of wolves remaining the same, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can secure enough food without overexerting myself. A moderate increase in theta allows me to take advantage of the higher sheep count while still conserving energy for future hunts."
