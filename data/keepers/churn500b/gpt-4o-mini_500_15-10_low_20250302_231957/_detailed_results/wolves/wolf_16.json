            "I chose this theta because with an increasing number of wolves, competition for food is rising. By lowering my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival in a crowded environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By lowering my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, and while the number of wolves has increased, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food without exhausting myself or competing too fiercely with other wolves. A slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making them scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and less food for me. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting may be less rewarding. By increasing my intensity slightly to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion, ensuring I remain competitive without exhausting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, indicating that hunting may be less successful. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, allowing me to survive longer without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, balancing my needs with the current scarcity of resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low, and the competition among wolves is high due to their recent decrease. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in the long run."
