            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, which means there is enough food to sustain us without overexerting myself. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, ensuring my survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population increasing and the number of wolves remaining stable, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success. This way, I can avoid overexertion and ensure my survival in the long run, especially since other wolves are also competing for the same resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, which presents a good opportunity for hunting. However, with the number of wolves remaining the same, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still secure enough food while avoiding overexertion and competition with other wolves. A theta of 0.75 allows me to be aggressive enough to catch prey but not so intense that I risk exhausting myself or attracting too much attention.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for the available sheep. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, which presents a good opportunity for hunting. By increasing my intensity to 0.75, I can take advantage of the higher prey availability while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 14 wolves competing for food, a slightly reduced intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This strategy balances the need to hunt efficiently without overexerting myself, especially since the number of wolves hasn't increased.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, which means competition for food is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, while still contributing to the pack's overall success. This strategy allows me to survive longer in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. By increasing my intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the larger prey while still being cautious, as the number of wolves remains the same. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, which means there is enough food available. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively when needed.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, providing a better opportunity for hunting. By increasing my intensity to 0.60, I can take advantage of the higher prey availability while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy and avoid competition while still allowing for opportunistic hunting if the chance arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased slightly, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to hunt effectively while still conserving energy in case the situation worsens. This allows me to adapt to the changing environment and ensure my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, competition for food is higher, so a lower intensity will help conserve energy while still allowing for opportunistic hunting. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 20 wolves, competition for food is present but not overwhelming. A slight increase in intensity from my previous theta allows me to take advantage of the available prey without overexerting myself, ensuring I can sustain my energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and with 20 wolves competing for food, a moderate hunting intensity will allow me to secure enough resources while avoiding overexertion. This balance helps ensure my survival without risking depletion of the sheep too quickly."
