            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 14 wolves competing for food, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still increasing my chances of a successful hunt. This way, I can adapt to the competition without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased slightly, which presents a good opportunity for hunting. However, with the number of wolves remaining the same, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I don't overexert myself and risk injury or depletion of resources. A theta of 0.40 allows me to hunt effectively while conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because with 45.18 sheep and 15 wolves, the competition for food is significant. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure enough food while avoiding overexertion that could lead to unnecessary risks. This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the current situation and ensure my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 16 wolves competing for food, a moderate increase in hunting intensity will help me secure enough resources without overexerting myself. This balance allows for sustainable hunting while still being competitive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased slightly, and the number of wolves has increased. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. This balance allows me to avoid competition with other wolves who may be hunting at maximum intensity, ensuring my survival in a potentially crowded hunting scenario.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and failure. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and wait for a better opportunity to hunt when the conditions improve.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and with the number of wolves remaining stable, a moderate increase in hunting intensity could help secure food without risking overexertion. This balance allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack"
