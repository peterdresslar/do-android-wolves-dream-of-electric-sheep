            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the increase in wolves means competition for food is higher. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance will help ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and ensure my survival without risking depletion of resources.",
            "I chose this theta because with the increase in the wolf population, competition for food is intensifying. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success. This strategy allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics and ensure my survival without risking depletion of resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, competition for food is higher, so a lower intensity will conserve energy while still allowing for some hunting. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and less food for me. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and less food for me. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, I need to increase my hunting intensity to compete effectively for the limited resources. A theta of 0.75 allows me to hunt more aggressively while still conserving some energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, and the number of wolves remains high. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. This balance may help ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt when necessary. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and increases my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the wolf population is also declining. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and I need to balance my energy expenditure with the risk of hunting. By increasing my intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the available prey while still conserving energy for future hunts, especially given the recent decrease in both sheep and wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and I need to balance my energy expenditure with the need to hunt effectively. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack",

            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, but the wolf population has decreased significantly. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can balance the need for food while also conserving energy and avoiding competition with other wolves. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
