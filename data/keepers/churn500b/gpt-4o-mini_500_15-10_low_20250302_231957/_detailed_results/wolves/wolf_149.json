By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves for the dwindling sheep population. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current environment and increase my chances of survival.",

With more wolves around, I need to conserve energy and avoid competition for limited prey. A lower intensity will help me survive longer while waiting for better opportunities.",

By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts, given the rising number of wolves. This balance is crucial for my survival.",
