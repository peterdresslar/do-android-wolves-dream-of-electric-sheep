            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, which means competition for food is increasing. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey without overexerting myself, as the risk of failure is still present with so many wolves around.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 6 wolves competing for food, a moderate intensity allows me to balance between conserving energy and increasing my chances of a successful hunt. This way, I can still contribute to the pack while ensuring my own survival.",
            "I chose this theta because with an increase in the wolf population, competition for food is rising. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.65, I can improve my chances of securing enough food while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a growing pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still contributing to the pack's overall success. This balanced approach increases my chances of survival in a growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, which means competition for food is increasing. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of securing a meal while still being cautious not to overexert myself, as the risk of attracting attention from other wolves is present.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival in a growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because with an increase in the wolf population, competition for food is higher. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.65, I can balance the need to secure enough food while conserving energy and avoiding overexertion. This strategy allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics of the pack and the available prey.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy while still allowing me to participate in hunts without overexerting myself. This balance increases my chances of survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With an increase in the wolf population, competition for food will be higher. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.30, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and increase my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while conserving energy, as the wolf population has increased. This approach allows me to adapt to the changing environment and improve my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with more wolves around, competition for food is increasing. By raising my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of successfully catching prey while still conserving some energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at full intensity could lead to competition and overexertion without guaranteed success. A slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and avoid competition while still allowing for some hunting success.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, I need to increase my hunting intensity to ensure I can catch enough food. However, I also want to avoid overexerting myself, as the wolf population remains high and competition for food is still a concern.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, which means there is less food available. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.40, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.
