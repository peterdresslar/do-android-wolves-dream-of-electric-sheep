            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making them scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and less food for everyone. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition, increasing my chances of survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my hunting intensity from 0.40 to 0.60, I can improve my chances of securing enough food while still being cautious, as the number of wolves remains the same. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the wolf population has increased. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves for a dwindling food source. This strategy allows me to survive longer while waiting for conditions to improve.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food.
