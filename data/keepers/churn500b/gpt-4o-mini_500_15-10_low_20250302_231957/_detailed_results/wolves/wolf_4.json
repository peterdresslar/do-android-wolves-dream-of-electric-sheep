            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, indicating more food availability. However, with the number of wolves remaining the same, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can secure enough food without overexerting myself. A theta of 0.70 allows me to be competitive while conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, but the wolf population has decreased. This suggests that hunting may be more competitive, and a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in securing food. A lower theta also reduces the risk of attracting attention from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because with 18.96 sheep available, there's a good opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. By increasing my intensity slightly from my previous theta of 0.50, I can take advantage of the sheep population while still conserving energy in case of future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. With fewer wolves around, a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in securing food. This balance helps ensure my survival in a changing environment."
