            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. With an increase in the wolf population, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and overexploitation of the remaining sheep. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of catching enough prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with the wolf population remaining stable, hunting at full intensity may not be sustainable. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, increasing my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment."
