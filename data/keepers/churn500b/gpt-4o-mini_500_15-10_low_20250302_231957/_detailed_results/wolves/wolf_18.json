            "I chose this theta because with the increase in the wolf population, competition for food is rising. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance my energy expenditure while still being effective in hunting. This allows me to conserve energy for future hunts while still contributing to the pack's success.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, I need to increase my hunting intensity to ensure I can secure enough food for survival. A theta of 0.70 balances the need for increased effort while still conserving some energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts. This strategy increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who may be hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to survive longer while waiting for a more favorable situation.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the wolf population is still high. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while also conserving energy, as hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable given the current prey availability.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a scarcity of food. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while conserving energy, as the sheep population is not high enough to support maximum hunting. This approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity and improve my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to overexploitation of the resource. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and ensure my survival while still contributing to the pack's efforts. This cautious approach allows me to adapt to the current situation and avoid competition with other wolves."
