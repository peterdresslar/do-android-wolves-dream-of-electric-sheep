            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and with the recent increase in wolves, a moderate hunting intensity will help me conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt. This way, I can avoid overexertion and ensure my survival as competition increases.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and less food for everyone. By choosing a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, which means food is becoming scarcer. However, the increase in the wolf population suggests that competition for food is rising. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly to 0.65, I can improve my chances of catching enough food while still conserving energy for future hunts, balancing the need for survival with the risks of overexertion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts. This strategy helps ensure my survival by avoiding overexertion in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making them a more valuable resource. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can take advantage of the situation while still conserving energy for future hunts, especially since the wolf population is increasing and competition for food may become fiercer.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting may be more challenging. By increasing my intensity slightly from 0.60 to 0.75, I can improve my chances of successfully hunting while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with the number of wolves remaining constant, hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting more competitive among wolves. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion. This allows me to contribute to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the wolf population is also declining. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and resources while still contributing to the pack's survival. This approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity and avoid overexertion, ensuring I remain strong for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating that hunting may be less successful. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while conserving energy and avoiding overexertion, which is crucial given the declining wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, and the number of wolves is also declining. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and resources while still contributing to the pack's survival.
