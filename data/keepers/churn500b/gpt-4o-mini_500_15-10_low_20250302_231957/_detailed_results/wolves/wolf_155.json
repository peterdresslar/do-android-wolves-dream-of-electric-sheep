This balance helps ensure my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because with a significant number of sheep available and the wolf population remaining stable, I can afford to increase my hunting intensity slightly without risking overexertion. This allows me to balance the need for food with the competition from other wolves, who will likely hunt at maximum intensity.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased slightly, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion and competition with other wolves. This way, I can still hunt effectively while conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and less food for me. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival.",
