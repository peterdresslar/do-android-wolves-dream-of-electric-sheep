This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and risk of injury. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid confrontation while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, which means food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly to 0.50, I can balance the need to hunt effectively while conserving energy for future hunts, ensuring my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating less food availability. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises."
