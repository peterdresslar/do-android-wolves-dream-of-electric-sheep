            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, leading to more competition for the available sheep. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.25, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because with 43.38 sheep and 14 wolves, the competition for food is still present, but not overwhelming. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly to 0.40, I can improve my chances of catching prey without overexerting myself, which could lead to exhaustion or injury. This balance allows me to be more strategic and conserve energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because with 45.18 sheep and 15 wolves, the competition for food is still significant. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure enough food while also conserving energy and avoiding overexertion, which is crucial for my survival in a stable population of wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.65, I can improve my chances of securing enough food while still being cautious not to overexert myself, as the sheep population is relatively stable.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 16 wolves, the competition for food is manageable. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly from my previous theta of 0.65, I can take advantage of the current sheep availability while still conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts. This way, I can adapt to the changing environment and ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means food is becoming scarcer. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to survive longer while waiting for a better opportunity.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population decreasing slightly and the number of wolves remaining stable, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food while avoiding overexertion. A theta of 0.55 allows me to be more efficient in my hunting without competing too aggressively with other wolves."
