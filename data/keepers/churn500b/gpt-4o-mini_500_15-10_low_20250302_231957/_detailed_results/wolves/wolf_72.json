            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making them scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at a slightly higher intensity will increase my chances of a successful hunt while still being mindful of the risks of overexertion. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's survival. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the declining wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, which may help me survive longer in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and a moderate hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt. This balance can help ensure my survival without overexerting myself, especially since the wolf population is decreasing.",
            "I chose this theta because the population of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and the recent decrease in wolves suggests that hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and further depletion of my pack. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid overhunting, ensuring my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the population of sheep is still relatively high, and I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure my survival while also considering the decreased number of wolves. By increasing my intensity to 0.50, I can take advantage of the available prey without overexerting myself, which could lead to exhaustion or injury in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, but the wolf population has decreased significantly. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival while still being able to hunt effectively when necessary.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition for food is becoming more intense.
