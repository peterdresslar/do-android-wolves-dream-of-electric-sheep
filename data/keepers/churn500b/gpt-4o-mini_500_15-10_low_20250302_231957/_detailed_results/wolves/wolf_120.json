            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population increasing and the number of wolves remaining the same, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can secure enough food without overexerting myself. A moderate intensity allows me to be efficient while still conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the increasing wolf population. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves for the limited prey. This strategy allows me to survive longer while waiting for better opportunities.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the increasing wolf population. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating that hunting may be more challenging. However, with an increase in the wolf population, I need to be more competitive to secure food. A theta of 0.70 allows me to increase my hunting intensity without exhausting myself, balancing the need for survival with the current prey availability.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the wolf population is increasing. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt. This balance allows me to survive longer in a competitive environment where resources are becoming scarcer.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the number of wolves is increasing. By increasing my hunting intensity, I can improve my chances of catching enough food before competition becomes too fierce. A theta of 0.70 allows me to be more aggressive while still conserving some energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because with an increasing number of wolves and a decreasing sheep population, hunting at a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success. This way, I can avoid overexertion and ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and less food for everyone. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and with the number of wolves remaining the same, I can afford to increase my hunting intensity slightly. This will help me secure enough food while still being cautious, as overexerting myself could lead to unnecessary risks.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my intensity slightly from 0.45 to 0.55, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy, as the overall wolf population remains stable. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the wolf population has increased. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting may be more challenging.
