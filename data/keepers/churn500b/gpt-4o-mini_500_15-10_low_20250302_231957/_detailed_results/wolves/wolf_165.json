            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.25, I can conserve energy and avoid overexerting myself while still participating in the hunt. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and increases my chances of survival without risking depletion of resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can balance my energy expenditure while still contributing to the pack's success. This way, I can avoid overexertion and ensure my survival in a more competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased slightly, and the wolf population has increased. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can better compete for food while still conserving energy, as hunting at maximum intensity may lead to overexertion and risk of injury. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and avoid competition while still allowing for some hunting success.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, and with more wolves around, competition for food will be fierce. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This strategy allows me to adapt to the changing environment and increases my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly to 0.40, I can improve my chances of catching prey without overexerting myself, as other wolves are still hunting at maximum intensity. This balance helps ensure my survival while being mindful of the dwindling resources."
