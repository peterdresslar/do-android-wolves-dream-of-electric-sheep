            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population means competition for food is rising. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can better secure my share of the dwindling sheep population while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that food is becoming scarcer. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's efforts. This balanced approach allows me to survive without overexerting myself, especially since the number of wolves remains constant.",
