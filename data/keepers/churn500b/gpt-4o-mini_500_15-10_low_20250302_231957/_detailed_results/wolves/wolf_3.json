            "I chose this theta because with 15 sheep and 10 wolves, the competition for food is high. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of successfully catching prey while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the number of sheep increasing and the wolf population remaining stable, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself, especially since other wolves are also competing for the same resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, indicating a potential for a successful hunt. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition is less intense. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can take advantage of the current situation while still being cautious, as the overall trend shows a decrease in wolves, which could mean fewer threats to my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. With the wolf population decreasing, a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's survival. This balance helps ensure I can hunt effectively while also adapting to the current dynamics.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, but the wolf population has decreased. A lower hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. By adjusting my intensity to 0.50, I can balance the risk of competition with other wolves while still being effective in securing food for survival."
