            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the increase in the wolf population means competition for food is higher. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise. This strategy allows me to adapt to the changing environment and ensure my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can better secure my share of the dwindling sheep population while still conserving some energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and avoid competition for fewer prey. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival given the current dynamics.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, which means food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can maximize my chances of catching enough food while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the wolf population is also declining. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, and with fewer sheep, hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and increase my chances of survival while still contributing to the pack's needs.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still being cautious, as overhunting could lead to further depletion of resources and increase competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the decreased wolf population. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who may be hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to ensure my survival while still taking advantage of the available prey."
