By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.65, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy while still allowing for some hunting opportunities. This balance increases my chances of survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting may be less fruitful. By increasing my intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the remaining sheep while still being cautious, as the number of wolves remains the same. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival.",

By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can better compete for resources while still being cautious, as overexertion could lead to depletion of energy or injury. This balance helps ensure my survival without risking too much in a dwindling population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is increasing. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, which may be more aggressive. This strategy allows me to survive longer while waiting for a more favorable hunting opportunity.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food while avoiding overexertion. Increasing my intensity slightly to 0.60 allows me to be more competitive without risking a complete depletion of resources.",

However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests competition is fierce. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can take advantage of the available prey while still being cautious about overexerting myself in a dwindling pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, but the wolf population has decreased. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's survival.
