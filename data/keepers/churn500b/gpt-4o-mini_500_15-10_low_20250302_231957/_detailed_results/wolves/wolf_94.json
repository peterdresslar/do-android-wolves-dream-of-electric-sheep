By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can improve my chances of catching enough prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival, especially with other wolves competing for the same resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and avoid competition while still allowing for some hunting success.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating less food availability. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.45, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival, especially with the increasing number of wolves competing for the same resources.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population decreasing, it's wise to conserve energy and avoid overexertion. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can still contribute to the pack's needs while ensuring my own survival in case the situation worsens.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means hunting intensity needs to be adjusted to ensure sustainability. By increasing my intensity slightly, I can contribute to the hunt without overexerting myself, considering the stable wolf population. This balance helps ensure my survival while still allowing for future hunting opportunities.",
