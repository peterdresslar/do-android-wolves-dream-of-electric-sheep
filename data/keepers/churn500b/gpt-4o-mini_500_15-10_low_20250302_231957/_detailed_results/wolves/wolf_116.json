By increasing my intensity slightly to 0.60, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival as the competition among wolves remains constant.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This balanced approach allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself, ensuring my survival in a competitive environment.",
