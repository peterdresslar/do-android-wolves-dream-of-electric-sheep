            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at a higher intensity will increase my chances of catching prey while still being mindful of the competition. A theta of 0.60 balances the need for food with the risk of overexertion.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population means more competition for food. By raising my hunting intensity, I can better secure my share of the dwindling sheep population, especially since their numbers have decreased. A higher theta will help me adapt to the current situation and ensure my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and reduce competition for the remaining sheep. This way, I can still hunt effectively without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at full intensity could lead to wasted energy and increased competition with other wolves. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the available food while still being cautious, as overexerting myself could lead to exhaustion or danger from other wolves. A balanced approach will help ensure my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in the long run.",
