            "I chose this theta because with the increase in the wolf population, competition for food will be higher. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the current sheep population while still being cautious. A theta of 0.15 allows me to balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion and attracting attention from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, I need to be cautious and conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. A moderate intensity allows me to remain competitive without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy. This balance is crucial for my survival, especially with the rising number of wolves competing for the same resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting more competitive. By increasing my intensity slightly to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while conserving energy, as the recent increase in wolves means competition is high. This way, I can still hunt effectively without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making them a scarcer resource. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can take advantage of the situation while still being cautious, as the wolf population has increased. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and wasted energy. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, ensuring my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, which means hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. By increasing my hunting intensity from my previous theta of 0.30 to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while also considering the declining prey availability. This approach helps ensure my survival without overexploiting the remaining sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with more wolves than prey, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still conserving energy. This approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and competition from other wolves, ensuring my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while also conserving energy, as the competition among wolves is high. This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment."
