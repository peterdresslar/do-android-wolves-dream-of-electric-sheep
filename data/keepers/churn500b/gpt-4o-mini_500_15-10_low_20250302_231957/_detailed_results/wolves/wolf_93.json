However, with 20 wolves competing for the same prey, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food without exhausting myself or drawing too much attention from other wolves. A theta of 0.75 allows me to hunt effectively while conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means food is becoming scarcer. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to survive longer while waiting for better conditions.",

By increasing my intensity slightly from 0.60 to 0.75, I can improve my chances of a successful hunt while still conserving energy for future needs. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a potentially scarce environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and avoid competing too aggressively with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the overall population of wolves is also declining. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey while still having a chance to catch food when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high, and I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can catch enough food without overexerting myself. Increasing my intensity slightly to 0.60 allows me to be more competitive while still conserving energy, especially since the wolf population has decreased and competition may be less fierce."
