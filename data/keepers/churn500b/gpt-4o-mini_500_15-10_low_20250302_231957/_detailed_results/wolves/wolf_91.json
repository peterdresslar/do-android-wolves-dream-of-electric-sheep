            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests that competition for food will be higher. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a more competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population increasing and the number of wolves remaining stable, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to balance the need for food while minimizing competition with other wolves. This way, I can still secure enough resources without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased significantly, which means competition for food is higher. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, while still allowing for the possibility of hunting if the opportunity arises. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a crowded environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the increase in the wolf population and the decrease in sheep, hunting at a moderate intensity allows me to balance the need for food while avoiding overexertion and competition with other wolves. This way, I can conserve energy and still contribute to the pack's success without risking my own survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of securing enough food while still being cautious, as the number of wolves has increased as well. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, and the number of wolves has increased. By reducing my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still contributing to the hunt when necessary. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy while still allowing for some hunting. This way, I can avoid competition with other wolves and increase my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey without overexerting myself, as the competition with other wolves remains constant. This balance helps ensure my survival while being mindful of the current situation.",
