            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting at maximum intensity less viable. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high with their numbers also declining. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while conserving energy. This approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and competition, ensuring my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, and with fewer sheep, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to overexploitation and starvation. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and increase my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexerting myself. This way, I can still contribute to my survival while being mindful of the dwindling prey and competition.",

By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who may be hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation while still being able to hunt effectively when necessary.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, and the wolf population has decreased. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can balance the need for food while minimizing the risk of overexertion in a competitive environment. This approach allows me to conserve energy and adapt to the changing dynamics of the pack.",
