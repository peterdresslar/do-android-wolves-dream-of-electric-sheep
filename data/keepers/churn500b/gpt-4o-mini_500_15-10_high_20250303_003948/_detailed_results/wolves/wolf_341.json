A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while reducing the pressure on the wolf population. This cautious approach aligns with the need for long-term sustainability and balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while also reducing pressure on the wolf population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence."
