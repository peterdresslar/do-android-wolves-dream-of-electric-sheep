This approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species and maintains a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and a cautious approach is necessary to allow them to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while ensuring the sheep have a chance to increase their numbers. This balance is crucial for the long-term survival of both species.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 4.50, it indicates that we need to be cautious in our hunting. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach that can help the sheep recover while still enabling the wolf population to thrive without overexploitation.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and with a high wolf population, competition is likely to increase. A moderate approach allows for some hunting while giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is relatively high, indicating increased competition. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity, allowing the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is relatively high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain its health. This approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence and avoids the risk of depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will allow sheep to recover while we focus on reducing competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment will help maintain balance in the ecosystem.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure on the sheep, allowing their numbers to recover while we manage our own population dynamics more sustainably.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need to focus on competition among wolves rather than hunting sheep. This will allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach helps maintain balance and avoids overexploitation."
