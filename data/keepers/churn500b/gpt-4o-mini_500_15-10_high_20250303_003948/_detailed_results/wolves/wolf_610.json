A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, enabling the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. This strategy aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and sustainable coexistence.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. With the wolf population being relatively high, focusing on competition among wolves rather than intense hunting will help maintain balance and ensure the long-term survival of both species.",

By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem. This gradual adjustment will help prevent overhunting and ensure long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This cautious approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity, I can help sustain the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover.
