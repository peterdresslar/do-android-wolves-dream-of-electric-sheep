            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and with a high wolf population, it is crucial to focus on competition among wolves rather than intensifying hunting. This will allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution. With the wolf population moderately high, it is wise to focus on competition among wolves rather than intensifying hunting. This will allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we manage our numbers more sustainably. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance and avoids over-depletion of sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is concerningly low, and with a high wolf population, competition is likely increasing. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on reducing competition among wolves. This approach aligns with the need for a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A lower theta will allow sheep to recover while reducing pressure on the wolf population. This cautious approach helps maintain balance and ensures long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A theta of 0.30 allows me to focus on reducing competition while giving sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance in the ecosystem without depleting the sheep further.",
