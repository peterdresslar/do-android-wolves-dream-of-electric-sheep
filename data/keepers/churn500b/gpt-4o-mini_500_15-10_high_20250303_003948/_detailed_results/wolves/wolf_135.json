            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating a need for caution in hunting. However, with a high sheep-to-wolf ratio, there is room to increase hunting intensity slightly to ensure the wolf population remains healthy. A gradual increase to 0.40 allows for sustainable coexistence while addressing the current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while there are many sheep per wolf, I need to be cautious to avoid depleting their numbers too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the sheep",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is quite low at 6.4% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while reducing pressure on the wolf population, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta allows for more focus on competition, which can help stabilize the wolf population while giving sheep a chance to recover.
