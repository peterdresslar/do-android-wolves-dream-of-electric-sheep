            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating a need for caution in hunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while giving sheep a chance to recover. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that we need to prioritize their recovery over intense hunting. A lower theta will allow the sheep to stabilize and potentially increase, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and the need to avoid overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and it is crucial to focus on allowing their numbers to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity and give sheep a chance to stabilize, while still allowing for some competition among wolves to maintain our population dynamics.",
