A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still providing some sustenance for the pack. This approach helps maintain a balance between the two populations and avoids depleting the sheep further.",

To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. A gradual increase in theta will be considered as the sheep population improves.",
