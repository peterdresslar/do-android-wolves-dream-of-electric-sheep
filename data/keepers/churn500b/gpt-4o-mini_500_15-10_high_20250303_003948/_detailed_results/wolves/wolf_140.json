            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and a cautious approach is needed to allow their numbers to recover.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating a need for caution in hunting. However, with a high sheep-to-wolf ratio, there is room to increase hunting intensity slightly. A moderate increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach that supports wolf reproduction while giving sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while there are many sheep per wolf, I must be cautious not to deplete their numbers too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for more hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the long-term balance of the ecosystem.",
