            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will allow sheep to recover while keeping the wolf population in check. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity, allowing the sheep to recover while we manage our numbers more sustainably.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This gradual adjustment helps ensure long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure on the sheep, allowing their numbers to recover while we manage our own population dynamics.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow sheep to recover while we manage our numbers more sustainably. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance without risking a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while ensuring that the wolf population does not decline too rapidly. This approach supports a more sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a sustainable wolf population. This gradual adjustment will help avoid overhunting and ensure long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure on the sheep, allowing their numbers to recover while we adapt to the current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition among wolves. The sheep population is low, indicating that aggressive hunting could deplete their numbers further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population, ensuring long-term sustainability."
