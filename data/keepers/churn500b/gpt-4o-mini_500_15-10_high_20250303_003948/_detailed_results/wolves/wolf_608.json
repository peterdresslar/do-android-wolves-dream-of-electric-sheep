            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and with a high wolf population, it is crucial to focus on competition among wolves rather than intensifying hunting. This will allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution. While my previous theta was focused on competition, a slight increase to 0.30 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of sheep. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem. This gradual adjustment will help prevent a crash in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is relatively high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta allows for a focus on reducing competition and giving the sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is concerningly low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments to ensure long-term survival for both species.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating that competition among wolves is increasing. A slight increase from my previous theta will allow for some hunting to support reproduction, but I must remain cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. This approach aims to stabilize both populations while allowing the sheep to recover.",
