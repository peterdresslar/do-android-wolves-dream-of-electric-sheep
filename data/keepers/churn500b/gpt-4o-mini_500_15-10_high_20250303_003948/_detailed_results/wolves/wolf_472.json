Gradually reducing hunting intensity will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, while still allowing for some competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while there are many sheep per wolf, I must prioritize the long-term survival of both species. A moderate increase in hunting intensity allows for some replenishment of the sheep population while still enabling the wolf pack to thrive. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating a need for caution in hunting. However, the high sheep-to-wolf ratio suggests that there is room for increased hunting intensity without risking immediate depletion. A slight increase to 0.40 allows for a more balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still being mindful of the sheep population",
