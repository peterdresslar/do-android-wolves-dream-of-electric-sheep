            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that a cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to rebound, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while there are many sheep per wolf, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that caution is needed to prevent overhunting. However, with a high sheep-to-wolf ratio, there is room for a slight increase in hunting intensity. A theta of 0.40 allows for a gradual adjustment that balances the need for wolf reproduction with the sustainability of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while there are many sheep per wolf, we must prioritize the long-term survival of both species. A slight reduction in hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover while still enabling us to compete effectively with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. With the wolf population being moderately high, it is prudent to focus on competition among wolves rather than intense hunting of sheep. This will help maintain balance and ensure the long-term survival of both species.",

A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we manage our numbers more sustainably. This cautious approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is relatively high, leading to increased competition. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain a healthy population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta allows for reduced hunting pressure on sheep, giving them a chance to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining balance in the ecosystem.",
