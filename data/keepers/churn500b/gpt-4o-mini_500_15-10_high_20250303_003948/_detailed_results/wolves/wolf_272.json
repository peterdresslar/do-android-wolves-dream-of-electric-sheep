            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is quite low at only 5.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution in hunting. With the wolf population being relatively high, focusing on competition among wolves rather than aggressive hunting will allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers without overhunting. This gradual approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both species."
