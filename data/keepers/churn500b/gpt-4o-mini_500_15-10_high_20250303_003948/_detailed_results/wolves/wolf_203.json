            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help stabilize the ecosystem and ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating a need for caution in hunting. A moderate approach allows for some hunting while giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This approach aims to ensure the long-term survival of both species and maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low at only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem. This cautious approach helps prevent further depletion of the sheep population and supports the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and with the wolf population being moderately high, it's essential to focus on competition with other wolves rather than intensifying hunting. This will allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a healthy balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while still competing with other wolves. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is relatively high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta allows for a focus on reducing competition and giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This gradual adjustment helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is concerningly low, and the wolf population is relatively high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we manage our numbers more sustainably. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is concerningly low, and with a high wolf population, competition is likely increasing. A moderate approach allows for some hunting while giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while also helping to stabilize the wolf population. This gradual approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence and avoids sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need to focus on competition among wolves rather than intense hunting. This will allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a sustainable wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure on the sheep, allowing their numbers to recover while we navigate the challenges of competition. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A lower theta allows for a focus on reducing competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our own numbers. This gradual adjustment will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta allows for a focus on reducing competition and giving sheep a chance to recover, which is essential for long-term balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need to focus on competition among wolves rather than intense hunting. This will allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a stable wolf population."
