            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 25\n- Sheep population: 96.32\n- Wolf population: 9.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.928\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 10.70 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 9.6% of maximum capacity\n\nEcosystem observations:\n- The wolf population is relatively low, which may present opportunities for growth.\n- Sheep numbers are becoming concerning, suggesting caution may be needed.\n- There are many sheep per wolf, suggesting the ecosystem could support more hunting.\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

However, the current sheep-to-wolf ratio suggests that there is still room for hunting.

To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while managing the wolf population sustainably.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance without risking a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A moderate hunting intensity allows for some hunting while giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This cautious approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence.",

A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This gradual adjustment will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling us to maintain our numbers. This approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence and avoids depleting the sheep further.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. By reducing hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while managing competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition, while the sheep population is low and concerning. A lower theta allows for a focus on reducing competition among wolves and gives the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance in the ecosystem without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need to reduce hunting intensity to allow sheep to recover. This will help maintain a balance and prevent overexploitation of the sheep, ensuring long-term survival for both species."
