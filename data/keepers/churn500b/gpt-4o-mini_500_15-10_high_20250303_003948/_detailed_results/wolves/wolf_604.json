            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. A moderate theta value will help maintain a balance between hunting and ensuring the sheep can thrive, while still allowing for some wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating a need for caution in hunting. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population, ensuring long-term sustainability for both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and with the current wolf population being moderately high, it is wise to focus on competition with other wolves rather than intensifying hunting. This will allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and with the wolf population being moderately high, it is crucial to prioritize the recovery of the sheep. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to replenish their numbers while still maintaining a focus on competition with other wolves. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. By reducing hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while managing competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is relatively high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A theta of 0.30 allows me to focus on reducing competition while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This moderate approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This gradual adjustment helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance in the ecosystem.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This cautious approach helps maintain balance and avoids over-depletion of sheep.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure on the sheep, allowing their numbers to recover while we manage our own population dynamics more sustainably.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while managing competition among wolves.
