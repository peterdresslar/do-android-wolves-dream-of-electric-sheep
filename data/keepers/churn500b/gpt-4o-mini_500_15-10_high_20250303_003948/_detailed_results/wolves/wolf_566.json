A lower theta allows for a focus on reducing competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating that competition among wolves is increasing. A lower theta allows for reduced hunting intensity, giving the sheep a chance to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need to reduce hunting intensity to allow sheep to recover. This cautious approach will help maintain balance and prevent a crash in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is quite low at 4.5% of maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. A gradual increase from my previous theta will help maintain balance without causing drastic changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity, allowing the sheep to recover while also stabilizing the wolf population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This gradual adjustment helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain their numbers. This approach supports long-term sustainability and avoids drastic changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This cautious approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need to focus on competition among wolves rather than hunting sheep. This will allow the sheep to recover while preventing overpopulation of wolves, ensuring long-term balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution in hunting to allow sheep to recover. A gradual increase from my previous theta will help maintain balance while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while also considering the moderately high wolf population. A gradual decrease in hunting will help maintain balance without risking a crash in either population."
