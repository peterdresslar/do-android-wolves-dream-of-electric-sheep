To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while still considering the competition with other wolves. A gradual adjustment helps maintain balance without risking a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure on the sheep, allowing their numbers to recover while we focus on maintaining our own population stability.",

A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
