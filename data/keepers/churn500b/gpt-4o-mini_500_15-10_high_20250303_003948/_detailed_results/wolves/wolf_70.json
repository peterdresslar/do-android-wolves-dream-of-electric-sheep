            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while there are many sheep per wolf, we need to be cautious to avoid depleting their numbers too quickly. A moderate increase in hunting intensity allows for some reproduction among wolves while still giving sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and I need to prioritize their recovery while still considering the competition among wolves. A lower theta allows for a focus on reducing competition, giving sheep a chance to rebound without depleting their numbers further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and I need to prioritize their recovery while still allowing for some hunting. A theta of 0.30 reflects a cautious approach that balances competition with other wolves and the need for sheep to regain their numbers.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and with the wolf population being moderately high, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and with the wolf population being moderately high, it's crucial to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure and promote a more sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and with a high sheep-to-wolf ratio, it is crucial to prioritize the recovery of the sheep. A moderate approach will allow for some hunting while also giving sheep a chance to rebound, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our own numbers. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. A moderate hunting intensity will help maintain the sheep population while allowing wolves to compete effectively. This approach supports long-term sustainability and avoids over-depletion of sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is concerningly low, and the wolf population is relatively high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on reducing competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment is essential for maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and with a high wolf population, competition is increasing. A moderate approach allows for some hunting while giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need to focus on competition among wolves rather than intense hunting. This will allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a sustainable wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain their numbers. This approach aligns with the wisdom of making gradual adjustments to ensure long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. By reducing hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while managing competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on reducing competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a sustainable wolf population. This gradual adjustment helps prevent overhunting and supports long-term balance.",
