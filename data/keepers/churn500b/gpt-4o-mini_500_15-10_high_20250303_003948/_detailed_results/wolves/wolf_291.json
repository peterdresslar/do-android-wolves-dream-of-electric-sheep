A moderate theta allows for some hunting while prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population, ensuring long-term sustainability for both wolves and sheep.",

A moderate approach will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to compete effectively. This small adjustment helps maintain balance without risking a crash in either population.",

A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure on the sheep, allowing their numbers to recover while we manage our own population dynamics more sustainably.",
