            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and a cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while ensuring the sheep can gradually increase in population. This balance is crucial for the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and maintaining a cautious approach is essential to allow their numbers to recover.

A moderate increase in hunting intensity allows for sustainable coexistence while still considering the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that we need to be cautious with our hunting. However, the sheep-to-wolf ratio suggests that we can still increase our hunting intensity slightly without causing immediate harm to the sheep population. A small increase to 0.45 allows for a balanced approach that supports both our needs and the sustainability of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain itself. This approach supports long-term sustainability and avoids depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the current wolf population is high, leading to increased competition, while the sheep population is low and concerning. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover and stabilize, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem. This gradual adjustment will help prevent overhunting and support long-term survival.",
