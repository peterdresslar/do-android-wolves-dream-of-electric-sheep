            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species and avoids depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating a need for caution in hunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and a cautious approach is needed to allow their numbers to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while ensuring the sheep have a chance to rebound, which aligns with the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while there are many sheep per wolf, I need to be cautious to avoid depleting their numbers too quickly. A moderate increase in hunting intensity allows for better reproduction among wolves while still giving sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating a need for caution in hunting. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a focus on competition with other wolves.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and a more cautious approach is needed to allow their numbers to recover. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while maintaining a healthy balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and a cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while ensuring the sheep have a chance to rebound, thus promoting long-term sustainability for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and with the wolf population being moderately high, it is crucial to focus on competition among wolves rather than intensifying hunting. This will allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a balance in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating that a cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competition with other wolves while ensuring the sheep have a chance to rebound, promoting long-term balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and with a high wolf population, competition among wolves is likely increasing. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A moderate approach will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting to sustain the wolf population. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance and avoids over-depletion of sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is relatively high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure on the sheep, allowing their numbers to recover while we manage our own population dynamics more sustainably.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A moderate theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting, helping to stabilize the sheep population while still enabling some reproduction among wolves. This balance is crucial for long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on reducing competition within our pack. This approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence and avoids depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting, ensuring a more sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we manage our numbers more sustainably. This gradual approach helps maintain balance in the ecosystem.",

A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach helps maintain balance and prevents overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A theta of 0.30 allows for a cautious approach, focusing on reducing competition while giving sheep a chance to recover. This balance is essential for the long-term survival of both species.",
