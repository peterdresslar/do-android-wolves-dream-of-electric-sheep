A lower theta allows for more focus on competing with other wolves, which can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",

A slight increase from my previous value allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach aims to maintain a sustainable balance between both species.",
