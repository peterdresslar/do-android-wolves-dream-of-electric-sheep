            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and a cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while ensuring the sheep have a chance to stabilize and grow. This aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and a cautious approach is necessary to allow them to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while avoiding further depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that we need to be cautious with our hunting. While there are many sheep per wolf, a gradual increase in hunting intensity is necessary to ensure the sheep can recover without risking their population further. This moderate adjustment allows for a balanced approach that supports both our needs and the sustainability of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that while I can increase my hunting intensity slightly, I must do so cautiously to avoid depleting their numbers further. A small increase to 0.40 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term balance of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating a need for caution. A moderate approach allows for some hunting while giving sheep a chance to recover. This balance is crucial for the long-term survival of both species.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 4.50, it indicates that we need to be cautious about hunting intensity. A moderate approach allows for the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain its health.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and with a high wolf population, it is crucial to focus on competition among wolves rather than intensifying hunting. This will allow the sheep to recover while maintaining the wolf population sustainably.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is concerningly low, and the wolf population is relatively high. A moderate approach allows for some hunting while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This balance is crucial for the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and with a high wolf population, competition is likely to increase. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This gradual adjustment will help ensure long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is relatively high, indicating increased competition. A lower theta allows for a focus on reducing competition among wolves while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence and avoids depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is concerningly low, and with a high wolf population, competition is likely to increase. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This gradual adjustment will help maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution in hunting to allow sheep to recover. A moderate approach will help maintain balance and prevent overexploitation of the sheep while still allowing for some hunting.",
