            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 499\n- Sheep population: 46.45\n- Wolf population: 68.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.250\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.68 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 4.6% of maximum capacity\n\nEcosystem observations:\n- The wolf population is quite high, which may lead to increased competition.\n- Sheep numbers are becoming concerning, suggesting caution may be needed.\n- The ratio of sheep to wolves is becoming less favorable, which may require adaptation.\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

A theta of 0.30 allows me to focus on reducing competition while giving the sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This cautious approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure on the sheep, allowing their numbers to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably.",

A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while reducing pressure on the wolf population. This cautious approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while also addressing the competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain its health. This approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence and avoids depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is quite low at only 5% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while managing the wolf population more sustainably. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem.",

A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while reducing pressure on their dwindling numbers.
