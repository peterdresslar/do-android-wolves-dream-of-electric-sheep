            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that a more cautious approach is necessary. While my previous theta of 0.925 was effective for hunting, the current state suggests that I should reduce hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while my previous hunting intensity was effective, it is now crucial to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta value will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and with a high wolf population, competition is increasing. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, enabling sheep to recover while still permitting some hunting to support wolf reproduction. This gradual adjustment helps maintain a sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution in hunting to allow sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is concerningly low, and with a high wolf population, competition is likely to increase. By focusing on lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while managing the wolf population sustainably. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem.",

A gradual increase from my previous theta allows for cautious hunting without depleting the sheep further.",
