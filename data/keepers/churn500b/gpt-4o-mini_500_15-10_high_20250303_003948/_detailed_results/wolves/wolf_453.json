A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while also helping to stabilize the wolf population. This cautious approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while reducing pressure on the wolf population, promoting long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure on the sheep, allowing their numbers to recover while we manage our own population dynamics. This cautious approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating that increased competition among wolves could lead to a decline in our numbers. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity, I can help the sheep recover while still being cautious to avoid over-depletion. This gradual adjustment allows for a more sustainable balance.",

By slightly increasing my hunting intensity, I can help sustain my pack while allowing the sheep to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta allows for more focus on reducing competition and giving the sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",

This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. With the current sheep population at only 3.2% of its maximum capacity, it is crucial to prioritize the recovery of the sheep rather than intensifying hunting. A lower theta will help ensure that the sheep can replenish their numbers, allowing for a more sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance without risking a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while being cautious about the wolf population. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting.",
