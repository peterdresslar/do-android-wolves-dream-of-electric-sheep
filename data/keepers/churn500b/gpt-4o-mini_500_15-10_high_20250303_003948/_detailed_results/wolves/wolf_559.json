            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution in hunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population, ensuring long-term balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is quite low at 47.19, which is only 4.7% of its maximum capacity. With the wolf population being relatively high at 61.00, increasing competition among wolves is likely. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover while managing the wolf population sustainably.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach helps maintain balance and avoids overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and with a high wolf population, competition among wolves is increasing. A lower theta allows for a focus on reducing competition and giving the sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach helps maintain balance and avoids overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This cautious approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This gradual adjustment helps ensure long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. This approach supports long-term sustainability and prevents potential crashes in both populations."
