            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species and maintains a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution. A moderate approach allows for some hunting while giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low at only 11.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensifying hunting. This will allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to recover while still enabling us to compete with other wolves. This approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species and maintains a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species and maintains a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep while still allowing for some competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while I need to maintain a healthy wolf population, I must prioritize the recovery of the sheep. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still being cautious to avoid further depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and the wolf population is moderately high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. A lower theta will help maintain balance and prevent a crash in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution. With the wolf population being moderately high, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution. With the wolf population moderately high, it",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is concerningly low, and the wolf population is relatively high, indicating increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while reducing pressure on the wolf population, promoting long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting to support the wolf population. This approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence and avoids drastic changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is relatively high, indicating increased competition. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity, allowing the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This gradual adjustment aligns with the need for balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is concerningly low, and with the wolf population being relatively high, it is crucial to focus on reducing competition among wolves. This lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we manage our own numbers. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while reducing pressure on the wolf population. This cautious approach aligns with the need for long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This gradual adjustment will help create a more sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while preventing overhunting, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. By reducing hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while managing competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
