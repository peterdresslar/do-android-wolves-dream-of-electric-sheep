            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A theta of 0.30 allows for a cautious approach, focusing on reducing hunting intensity to give sheep a chance to recover while still maintaining some level of hunting to support our wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is concerningly low, and with a high wolf population, competition is increasing. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while reducing the pressure on our own numbers. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain their numbers. This approach helps to ensure long-term sustainability and avoids drastic changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This cautious approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta allows for more focus on competition, which can help reduce the wolf population slightly and give the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow sheep to recover while ensuring that the wolf population does not deplete the sheep further. This approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. By reducing hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while managing competition among wolves. This approach aligns with the goal of maintaining a sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach helps maintain balance and prevents overexploitation of the sheep.",
