By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both sheep and wolves while still competing with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species and prevents a potential crash in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while also reducing competition among wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while there are many sheep per wolf, we must be cautious to avoid depleting their numbers too quickly. A moderate increase in hunting intensity allows for a balance that can support both our population and the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while there are many sheep per wolf, we need to prioritize the long-term survival of both species. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling us to compete effectively with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution in hunting. However, with a high sheep-to-wolf ratio, there is room for increased hunting intensity without risking immediate depletion. A gradual increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach that supports both wolf reproduction and the recovery of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species and maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and it is crucial to prioritize their recovery. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep to stabilize and grow, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments to maintain long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to stabilize and grow, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low at only 12.4% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. A gradual decrease in theta will help maintain a balance while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and a cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from the previous theta, I can still maintain some pressure on the sheep while prioritizing their long-term survival and allowing for a more sustainable balance.",

            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is relatively high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
