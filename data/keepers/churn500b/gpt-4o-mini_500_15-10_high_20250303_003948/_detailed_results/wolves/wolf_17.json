            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach helps maintain balance and avoids overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we manage our numbers more sustainably. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance in the ecosystem."
