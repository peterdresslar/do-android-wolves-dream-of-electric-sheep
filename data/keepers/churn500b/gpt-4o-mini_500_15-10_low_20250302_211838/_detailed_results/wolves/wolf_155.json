            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy. This balance is crucial for my survival in a more competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased slightly, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity from 0.65 to 0.75, I can improve my chances of successfully catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. By lowering my intensity slightly, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt, ensuring my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and overexploitation of the remaining sheep. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and adapt to the changing environment while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, and with 22 wolves competing for food, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can catch enough prey without exhausting myself. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who may be hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and increase my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the number of wolves, and hunting at a lower intensity will help conserve energy while still allowing for a chance to catch prey. This approach reduces the risk of overexertion and potential failure, given the recent decrease in both sheep and wolf populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the stable wolf population. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while not overexerting myself, which could lead to exhaustion or injury. This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the current situation without risking too much against the competition.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in the wolf population suggests increased competition for food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can maximize my chances of catching sheep while still conserving energy. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. With the wolf population decreasing, a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive in the hunt. This balance helps ensure my survival in a changing environment."
