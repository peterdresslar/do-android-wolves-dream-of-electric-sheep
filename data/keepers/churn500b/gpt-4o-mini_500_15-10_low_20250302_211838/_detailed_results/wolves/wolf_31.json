            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy while still allowing for successful hunts. This balance increases my chances of survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high with their population also declining. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise. This strategy balances the need for survival with the current scarcity of prey.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of securing food while still being cautious, as the overall population of sheep is low. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a dwindling resource scenario.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a more competitive environment. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's efforts. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the declining wolf population, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, indicating a potential for a successful hunt. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests competition is fierce. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can take advantage of the sheep while still being cautious about the risks posed by other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, but the wolf population has decreased. This suggests that hunting at a lower intensity may be more sustainable, allowing me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, with the recent decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food while conserving energy and avoiding overexertion. A theta of 0.60 allows me to be more efficient in my hunting without risking too much competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. By increasing my intensity to 0.75, I can take advantage of the higher availability of prey while still conserving some energy for future hunts, ensuring my survival in a competitive environment."
