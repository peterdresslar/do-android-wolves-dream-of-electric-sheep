            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy while still allowing me to contribute to the pack's success. This balance increases my chances of survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity from 0.60 to 0.75, I can improve my chances of catching enough prey while still being mindful of the competition from other wolves. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition for food is becoming more intense. By reducing my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's survival. This balance allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics and ensure I have enough resources without risking my own well-being."
