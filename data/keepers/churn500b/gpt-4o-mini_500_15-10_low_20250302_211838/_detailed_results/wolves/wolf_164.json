            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and with the recent decrease in both sheep and wolves, it may be wise to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. This balance allows me to contribute to the pack's success without overexerting myself, ensuring my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased slightly, indicating a good food source. However, the number of wolves remains the same, meaning competition is still present. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, allowing me to adapt to the current situation and ensure my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because with a higher number of sheep and a stable wolf population, I need to increase my hunting intensity to secure enough food for survival. A theta of 0.75 allows me to be competitive without overexerting myself, considering that other wolves are also hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. With the recent decrease in the wolf population, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment."
