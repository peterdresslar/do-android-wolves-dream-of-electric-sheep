With fewer sheep, I need to conserve energy and avoid overexerting myself, especially since the wolf population has also decreased. A lower intensity allows me to adapt to the current scarcity while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition is high, and I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food without exhausting myself or attracting too much attention from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, with the recent decrease in the wolf population, it's important to balance intensity to avoid overexertion and ensure I can survive in the long term. A theta of 0.75 allows me to hunt effectively while conserving energy for future needs."
