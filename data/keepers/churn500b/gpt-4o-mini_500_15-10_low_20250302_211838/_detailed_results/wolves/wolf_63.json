            "I chose this theta because the population of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the current sheep population while still being cautious not to overexert myself and risk injury or depletion of resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, indicating a good food source. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can take advantage of this opportunity while still being cautious, as the number of wolves remains the same. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because with an increase in the wolf population, competition for food is rising. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival in a more competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, indicating a good food source. However, with the number of wolves remaining constant, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can secure enough food while avoiding overexertion. A theta of 0.65 allows me to hunt effectively without risking depletion of resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a more aggressive hunting strategy without risking overexertion. Increasing my intensity slightly to 0.75 will help me compete effectively with other wolves while still conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 21 wolves, competition for food is present. By lowering my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being effective in hunting. This balance helps ensure my survival without risking depletion of resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with the number of wolves remaining stable, I need to increase my hunting intensity to ensure I can secure enough food for survival. A theta of 0.75 allows me to be competitive without overexerting myself, as I still need to conserve energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with the increase in the wolf population, competition for food will be higher. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid drawing attention to myself while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the wolf population has increased. A lower hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves for limited prey. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of catching enough food while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival, especially with the wolf population remaining stable.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the hunt. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and increases my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's survival. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and increases my chances of survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity. This will help me conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's survival, especially since the trend shows a decrease in wolves. A balanced approach increases my chances of success without overexerting myself."
