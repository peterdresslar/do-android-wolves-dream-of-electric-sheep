            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and risk of injury. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with more wolves than sheep, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and scarcity. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and wait for a more favorable situation while still contributing to the pack's survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, with the decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food while avoiding overexertion. A moderate intensity allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics and increases my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting. However, with the number of wolves remaining the same, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can secure food without exhausting myself or competing too aggressively with others. A theta of 0.75 allows me to hunt effectively while still conserving energy for future needs.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. With fewer wolves around, I can afford to hunt at a slightly lower intensity to conserve energy while still being effective. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting. By increasing my intensity slightly from my previous theta of 0.60, I can take advantage of the higher sheep numbers while still being cautious. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself, especially since the number of wolves has remained stable.",
            "I chose this theta because with 28.60 sheep and 9 wolves, the competition for food is still significant. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. By increasing my intensity to 0.75, I can take advantage of the higher prey availability while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because with 33.91 sheep and 8 wolves, the competition for food is still significant. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This allows me to adapt to the current situation and avoid overexertion, which is crucial for my survival in a stable population of wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting. By increasing my intensity from 0.60 to 0.75, I can take advantage of the higher number of sheep while still being mindful of the competition from other wolves. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, which means there is more food available. However, with the number of wolves remaining the same, I need to be cautious. By lowering my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still taking advantage of the increased sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, indicating a good opportunity for hunting. By increasing my intensity slightly from my previous theta of 0.65 to 0.75, I can take advantage of the abundance of prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival in a crowded environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting.

            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased slightly, while the wolf population has increased significantly. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still contributing to the pack's overall success. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a more competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food.
