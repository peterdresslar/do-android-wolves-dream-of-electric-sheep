            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By lowering my intensity slightly, I can conserve energy while still participating in hunts. This approach allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself, ensuring my survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can still contribute to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my intensity slightly to 0.30, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion. This way, I can still hunt effectively while conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making hunting more competitive. By increasing my intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while conserving energy. This approach allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself, as the number of wolves remains stable.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of securing food while still conserving energy, as the overall wolf population remains stable.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the declining wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching enough food while still being mindful of the competition from other wolves. A theta of 0.55 allows me to balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, but the wolf population has decreased significantly. This suggests that hunting at maximum intensity may not be necessary, as there are fewer competitors for food. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, with the recent decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch prey while conserving energy and avoiding competition with other wolves. A theta of 0.60 allows me to be more aggressive than before while still being cautious.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased slightly, and the number of wolves has decreased. This suggests that there may be less competition for food. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.40, I can conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively. This strategy allows me to adapt to the changing environment and ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with the number of wolves remaining stable, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt. This strategy helps ensure my survival by avoiding overexertion and potential competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. With fewer wolves around, a moderate intensity allows me to balance my energy expenditure while still being competitive. This way, I can ensure my survival and potentially secure enough food.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 10 wolves competing for food, a moderate increase in hunting intensity will help me secure enough resources without overexerting myself. This balance allows me to remain competitive while conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, which means there is enough food available. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because with 37.67 sheep and 10 wolves, the competition for food is still significant. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly to 0.70, I can improve my chances of securing enough food while still being mindful of the risk of overexertion and potential failure. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, which means there is more food available. However, the number of wolves remains the same, so hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and overexploitation of resources. By lowering my intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and still have a chance to hunt effectively without risking my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity. By reducing my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival in a growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased slightly, indicating a potential for more food. However, with the number of wolves remaining the same, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I don't overexert myself while still being competitive. A theta of 0.60 allows me to hunt effectively without risking exhaustion or attracting too much attention from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy while still allowing for potential hunting opportunities. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a competitive environment.",
