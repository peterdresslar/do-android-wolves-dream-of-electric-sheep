            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. With more wolves around, I need to balance my hunting intensity to conserve energy while still being effective. A slightly lower intensity allows me to adapt to the changing conditions and increases my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making food scarcer. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can maximize my chances of catching enough food while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival as the competition with other wolves remains constant.",
            "I chose this theta because the recent decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and reduce competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively. This balance helps ensure my survival in a time of scarcity.",
            "I chose this theta because the population of sheep is decreasing, which means hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased slightly, indicating a potential for more food. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests competition is fierce. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can take advantage of the available prey while still being cautious, as overexertion could lead to unnecessary risks.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased slightly, while the number of wolves has decreased. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still contributing to the pack's overall success. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, with the recent decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food while also conserving energy and avoiding overexertion. A moderate intensity of 0.60 allows me to take advantage of the sheep while being mindful of the competition and my own survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. By reducing my intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, especially since the number of wolves has remained stable. This balance helps ensure my survival while still competing effectively.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, but the wolf population has decreased. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still taking advantage of the available prey. This strategy allows me to ensure my survival in a changing environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with 29.38 sheep and 10 wolves, the competition is high. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This balance increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, which means hunting at maximum intensity could lead to overexertion and competition with other wolves. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt without risking depletion of resources.",
            "I chose this theta because with 32.43 sheep and 10 wolves, the competition is high. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This balance increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 10 wolves competing for food, hunting at a slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective.
