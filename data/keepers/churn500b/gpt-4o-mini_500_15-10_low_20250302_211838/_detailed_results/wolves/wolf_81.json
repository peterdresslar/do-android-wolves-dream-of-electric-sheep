            "I chose this theta because with an increase in the wolf population, competition for food will be higher. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success. This strategy allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics and ensure my survival without risking depletion of resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, leading to more competition for food. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can still contribute to the pack's success while conserving energy and reducing the risk of overexertion. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and with 23 wolves competing for food, a moderate increase in hunting intensity will help me secure enough resources without overexerting myself. This way, I can balance my energy expenditure and ensure my survival while still being competitive.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population decreasing and the number of wolves remaining the same, hunting at a slightly reduced intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's efforts. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt. This balanced approach allows me to adapt to the current situation and increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of securing food while still conserving energy, as the overall wolf population remains stable.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the number of wolves, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to overexertion and competition with other wolves. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is increasing. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a balanced approach. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can take advantage of the available resources while still being cautious, given the recent decrease in the wolf population. This strategy helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself or risking competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the population of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and with the recent decrease in both sheep and wolves, a lower hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's needs. This strategy helps ensure my survival by reducing competition for food and allowing for a more sustainable approach to hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, with the recent decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure my survival while still contributing to the pack"
