            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the increase in the wolf population means competition for food is higher. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.45, I can balance the need to hunt effectively while conserving energy for future hunts, ensuring my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low, and the competition among wolves is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment."
