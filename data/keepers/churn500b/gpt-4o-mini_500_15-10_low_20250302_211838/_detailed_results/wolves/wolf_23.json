By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still maintaining a chance to catch prey. This balance helps ensure my survival in a changing environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy while still allowing for some hunting. This balance increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself."
