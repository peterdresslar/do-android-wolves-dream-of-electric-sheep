With fewer wolves around, a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive in the hunt. This balance helps ensure my survival in a fluctuating environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. By increasing my intensity slightly to 0.60, I can take advantage of the higher prey availability while still conserving energy and reducing the risk of overexertion in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition for food is becoming more intense. With the number of sheep increasing, a lower hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still benefiting from the available prey. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment."
