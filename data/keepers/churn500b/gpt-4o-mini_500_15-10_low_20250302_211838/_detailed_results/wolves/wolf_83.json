            "I chose this theta because while the sheep population is still relatively high, the increase in wolves means competition for food is rising. By lowering my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and reduce the risk of overexertion, while still being able to hunt effectively if needed.",
            "I chose this theta because while the sheep population has decreased, the number of wolves remains the same. A slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, especially since I can adapt to the changing conditions. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting may be more challenging. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can improve my chances of successfully catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By lowering my intensity slightly, I can conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a challenging situation.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the wolf population is also declining. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who may be hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the wolf population is also declining. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who might be hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to survive longer while waiting for a more favorable situation.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, with the recent decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food without overexerting myself and risking injury or exhaustion. A moderate intensity allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics while still being competitive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, indicating more food availability. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can take advantage of this opportunity while still conserving energy compared to maximum intensity.
