            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a more cautious approach. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can still contribute to the pack's success while minimizing the risk of overexertion and competition with other wolves. This balance helps ensure my survival in a growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because with 45.92 sheep and 11 wolves, there is a decent amount of prey available. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while avoiding overexertion and competition with other wolves. This approach allows me to be more strategic and sustainable in my hunting efforts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, indicating a good opportunity for hunting. By increasing my intensity to 0.70, I can take advantage of the situation while still conserving some energy for future hunts, as the wolf population is increasing and competition will be tougher.",
            "I chose this theta because with an increase in the wolf population, competition for food is likely to intensify. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success. This balanced approach allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics and ensures my survival without risking depletion of resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased significantly, which means competition for food will be higher. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, allowing me to survive longer in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. With the wolf population increasing, hunting at a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting more competitive among wolves. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a changing environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and with other wolves maintaining their numbers, a moderate increase in hunting intensity will help ensure I can secure enough food while also conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that food is becoming scarcer. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise."
