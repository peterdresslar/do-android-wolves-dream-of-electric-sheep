            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. By reducing my intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This balance allows me to adapt to the changing environment and increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can maximize my chances of catching enough food while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival, especially with the current number of wolves remaining stable.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and the recent decrease in both sheep and wolves suggests that resources are becoming scarcer. By reducing my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in the wolf population suggests increased competition for food. With the sheep population slightly increasing, a moderate hunting intensity will allow me to secure enough food while conserving energy and avoiding overexertion. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment."
