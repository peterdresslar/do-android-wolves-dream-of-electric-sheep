By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can take advantage of the current situation without overexerting myself, allowing for a balance between hunting effectively and conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and failure. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and adapt to the changing environment while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, I need to increase my hunting intensity to ensure I can secure enough food for survival. A theta of 0.60 strikes a balance between being aggressive enough to compete with other wolves while not overexerting myself.",

By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment."
