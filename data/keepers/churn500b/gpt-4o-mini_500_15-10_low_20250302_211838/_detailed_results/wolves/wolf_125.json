            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and I want to conserve energy while still increasing my chances of catching prey. A moderate intensity allows me to remain competitive without overexerting myself, especially since the wolf population is increasing.",
            "I chose this theta because with an increase in the wolf population, competition for food will be higher. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a potentially scarce environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased slightly, indicating that food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the wolf population has increased. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting may be less rewarding. By increasing my intensity slightly from my previous theta of 0.60 to 0.75, I can take advantage of the remaining sheep while still conserving energy in case the situation worsens. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By lowering my intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This balance allows me to adapt to the current situation and increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the competition among wolves is high with their recent decline. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, with the recent decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still secure enough food without overexerting myself. A theta of 0.60 allows me to hunt effectively while conserving energy for future hunts."
