            "I chose this theta because while the sheep population is stable, the number of wolves remains the same. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of catching prey without overexerting myself, allowing for a balance between energy conservation and the need to secure food.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. With the recent decrease in the wolf population, a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's survival. This balance helps ensure I can hunt effectively while also being cautious of competition from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, but the number of wolves has decreased. This suggests that there may be less competition for food. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy while still taking advantage of the available prey. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a fluctuating environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, with the number of wolves remaining the same, I need to balance my hunting intensity to avoid competition and ensure my survival. A moderate intensity allows me to be efficient without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. By increasing my intensity to 0.65, I can take advantage of the higher prey availability while still conserving energy compared to maximum intensity. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself."
