            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and I want to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. By reducing my intensity slightly, I can avoid overexertion and increase my chances of survival in the long run, especially since the number of wolves has not changed.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, and with more wolves around, competition for food is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This balanced approach helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting may be more challenging. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can improve my chances of successfully catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. This approach allows me to adapt to the current situation and increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the number of wolves, and the recent decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a competitive environment. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition is less intense, allowing me to increase my hunting intensity slightly without risking overexertion. A theta of 0.60 balances the need for food with the current dynamics of the pack."
