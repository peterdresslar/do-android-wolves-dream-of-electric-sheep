            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and with the number of wolves remaining stable, a lower hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's efforts. This way, I can avoid overexertion and increase my chances of survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making food scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching enough food without overexerting myself, as the other wolves are still hunting at maximum intensity. This balance helps ensure my survival while being cautious.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion. This way, I can still hunt effectively while conserving energy for future hunts, ensuring my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid attracting attention from other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, and the wolf population has decreased. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can balance the need to secure food while conserving energy and avoiding overexertion, which is crucial given the recent decline in my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, indicating a potential for more food. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition is less intense. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.65, I can take advantage of the available prey while still being cautious, ensuring my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in the wolf population suggests that hunting at maximum intensity may lead to competition and overexploitation of the sheep. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and ensure a sustainable approach to hunting, while still contributing to the pack's needs.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased slightly, indicating a good opportunity for hunting. However, with the number of wolves remaining the same, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can secure enough food while avoiding overexertion. A theta of 0.60 allows me to be competitive without risking too much energy.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting. However, with the number of wolves remaining the same, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still compete effectively without overexerting myself. A theta of 0.75 allows me to be aggressive enough to catch prey while conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 10 wolves competing for them, a slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 10 wolves competing for food, hunting at a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because with 34.40 sheep and 10 wolves, the competition for food is significant. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of securing enough food while still being cautious, as the sheep population is not excessively high. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because with a stable number of wolves and a slight increase in sheep, I need to balance the risk of overexertion with the need to secure food. A theta of 0.75 allows me to hunt effectively while conserving energy for future hunts, ensuring my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 10 wolves competing for food, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This strategy balances the need to hunt without overexerting myself, especially since the other wolves are also hunting at maximum intensity.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased slightly, indicating a stable food source. With the number of wolves remaining constant, a lower hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive. This strategy helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a potentially crowded hunting scenario.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food will be higher. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can better secure my share of the dwindling sheep population while still conserving some energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, competition for food is higher, so a lower intensity will help conserve energy while still allowing for opportunistic hunting. This balance increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can maximize my chances of catching enough prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival, especially with the current competition from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can maximize my chances of securing enough food while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means food is becoming scarcer. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and hunting at a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack"
