            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still significantly higher than the number of wolves, allowing for a sustainable hunt. By increasing my intensity slightly, I can contribute to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high compared to the wolf population, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity. By increasing my theta from 0.25 to 0.40, I can take advantage of the increased wolf population while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of securing food while still being cautious, as overexerting myself could lead to exhaustion or injury. This balance helps ensure my survival in a declining population."
