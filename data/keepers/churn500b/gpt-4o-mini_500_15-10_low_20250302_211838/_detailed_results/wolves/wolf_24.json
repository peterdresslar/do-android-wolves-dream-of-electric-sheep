By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when necessary. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a more competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and so has the number of wolves. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who may be hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion, allowing me to adapt to the current scarcity while still being cautious.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the wolf population is also declining. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment."
