            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and I want to balance my energy expenditure with the likelihood of a successful hunt. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, especially since the other wolves are also increasing in number.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased slightly, and the wolf population has increased. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still contributing to the pack's overall success. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a changing environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey without overexerting myself, as the competition with other wolves is also increasing. A balanced approach helps ensure my survival while still being mindful of the dwindling resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and risk of injury. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid confrontations while still contributing to the pack's survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting may be less fruitful. By increasing my intensity slightly from my previous theta of 0.30, I can take advantage of the current situation while still being cautious, as the number of wolves remains the same. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly from my previous theta of 0.40 to 0.50, I can improve my chances of catching enough prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balanced approach helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and with the recent decrease in wolves, a lower hunting intensity will help conserve energy and resources while still allowing for successful hunts. This strategy may also reduce competition with other wolves who are likely to hunt at maximum intensity.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high compared to the dwindling wolf population. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while also being cautious, as the recent decrease in wolves suggests competition is fierce. This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the decreased number of wolves. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still taking advantage of the available prey. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition is less intense, allowing me to hunt at a slightly higher intensity without risking overexertion. This balance helps ensure my survival while still being cautious.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, and while the wolf population has decreased, it is still important to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can secure enough food without overexerting myself.
