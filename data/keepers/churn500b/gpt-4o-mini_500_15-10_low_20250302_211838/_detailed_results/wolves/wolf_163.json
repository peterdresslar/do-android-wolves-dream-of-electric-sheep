            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts, especially since the wolf population remains stable.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the wolf population is also declining. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low and the wolf population has decreased, indicating competition for food is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the number of wolves, and hunting at a lower intensity increases my chances of survival by conserving energy and reducing competition with other wolves. This way, I can still hunt effectively without overexerting myself in a dwindling resource environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. With the recent decrease in the wolf population, a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive in securing food. This balance helps ensure my survival in a changing environment."
