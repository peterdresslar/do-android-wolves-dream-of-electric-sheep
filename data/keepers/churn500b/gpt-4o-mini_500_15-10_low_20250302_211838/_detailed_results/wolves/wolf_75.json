            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that food is becoming scarcer. By lowering my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting might be less successful. By lowering my intensity slightly, I can conserve energy while still being competitive in the hunt. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself when resources are scarce.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making hunting less certain. By lowering my intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased slightly, which presents a good opportunity for hunting. By raising my intensity to 0.75, I can capitalize on this increase while still conserving some energy for future hunts, especially since the wolf population remains stable.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, indicating a good food supply. However, the number of wolves remains the same, which means competition is still present. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, but the wolf population has decreased. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still contributing to the hunt. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and ensure my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing more opportunities for hunting. By increasing my intensity slightly, I can take advantage of this abundance while still conserving energy. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself, especially since the number of wolves has remained stable.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the stable number of wolves. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. By increasing my intensity to 0.70, I can take advantage of the larger prey availability while still conserving some energy for future hunts, considering that the number of wolves remains constant.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, which means there is more food available. However, with the number of wolves remaining the same, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough prey without exhausting myself or risking failure. A slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. By raising my intensity to 0.75, I can take advantage of the higher prey availability while still conserving some energy for future hunts, considering the stable wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, which means there is enough food available. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to catch prey if necessary. This balance helps ensure my survival in a growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 12 wolves competing for food, a moderate increase in hunting intensity will help me secure enough resources while avoiding overexertion. This balance allows me to conserve energy and increase my chances of survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased slightly, indicating a stable food source. With the number of wolves remaining constant, a lower hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. This strategy balances my need for food with the competition from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, allowing me to survive longer while still contributing to the pack's overall success.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and I need to balance my energy expenditure with the likelihood of a successful hunt. By increasing my intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the current situation without overexerting myself, as the trend shows an increase in wolves which could lead to competition for food.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting more challenging. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid competition with others. This way, I can still hunt effectively without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of securing enough food while still being cautious, as the number of wolves remains the same. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can better compete with other wolves for food while still conserving some energy for future hunts.
