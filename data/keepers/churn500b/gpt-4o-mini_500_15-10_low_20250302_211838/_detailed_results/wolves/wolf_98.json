            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the wolf population is increasing. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves for the limited prey. This strategy allows me to survive longer while waiting for better conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because with the increase in the wolf population, competition for food is intensifying. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of catching enough sheep while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a growing pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can maximize my chances of catching enough prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the population of sheep is still relatively high, and with the recent decrease in the number of wolves, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt. This strategy helps ensure my survival by balancing the need to hunt with the risk of overexertion in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, but the wolf population has decreased. This suggests that hunting at a lower intensity may allow me to conserve energy while still taking advantage of the available prey. A moderate intensity will help ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, with the recent decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still compete with other wolves while also conserving energy for future hunts. A theta of 0.60 allows me to take advantage of the current sheep population without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. By raising my intensity slightly to 0.70, I can take advantage of the higher prey availability while still being cautious, as the number of wolves remains the same. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself."
