            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population at 52.02 and the number of wolves stable at 19, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to balance the need for food while minimizing competition with other wolves. By not hunting at maximum intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid drawing attention to myself, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the wolf population is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are likely to hunt at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to survive longer while waiting for a more favorable situation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and I want to balance my energy expenditure with the need to hunt effectively. By increasing my intensity slightly from my previous theta of 0.30, I can improve my chances of a successful hunt while still conserving energy in case the situation changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, and the overall trend shows a decline in wolves. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competing too aggressively with other wolves for the dwindling sheep. This strategy may help ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, and the wolf population has decreased. A moderate hunting intensity allows me to balance the need for food while being cautious of the dwindling wolf numbers. This way, I can still contribute to the pack"
