By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and increase my chances of survival.",

By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competing directly with other wolves who are also struggling.
