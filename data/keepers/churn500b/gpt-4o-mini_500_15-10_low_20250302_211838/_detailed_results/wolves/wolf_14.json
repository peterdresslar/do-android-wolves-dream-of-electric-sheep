            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity. By increasing my theta from 0.20 to 0.40, I can take advantage of the current situation without overexerting myself, as other wolves may also be hunting aggressively. This balance helps ensure my survival while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high compared to the wolf population. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can take advantage of the current situation without overexerting myself, allowing for a balance between hunting success and energy conservation. This way, I can ensure my survival while still being cautious of the increasing wolf numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can better secure my share of the dwindling sheep population while still managing my energy reserves. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively. This balanced approach increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are likely to hunt at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to survive longer in a challenging environment while still being able to hunt when the opportunity arises."
