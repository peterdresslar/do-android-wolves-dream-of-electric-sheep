By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival in a crowded environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the current number of sheep and wolves, a slightly reduced hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive. The sheep population has increased, providing a good opportunity for a successful hunt without overexerting myself. This balance helps ensure my survival in a stable environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a more cautious approach. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still having a chance to catch prey. This balance helps ensure my survival in a growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high, but the increase in wolves suggests more competition for food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of successfully hunting while still conserving some energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves in the area, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and reduce competition while still allowing for some hunting success."
