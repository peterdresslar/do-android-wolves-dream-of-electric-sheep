            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. With more wolves in the area, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and reduce competition for the remaining sheep. This balance allows me to adapt to the current situation while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making prey less abundant. With an increase in the wolf population, competition for food is higher. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid unnecessary risks while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, and with 21 wolves competing for food, a moderate hunting intensity will help me conserve energy while still increasing my chances of a successful hunt. This balance allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself, especially since the other wolves are also competing for the same resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting may be more challenging. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly to 0.60, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts, as the wolf population remains stable.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the competition among wolves is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the wolf population is also declining. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and increase my chances of survival while still contributing to the pack's overall success. A lower theta allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and avoid overexertion.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, which presents a good opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition is high, and I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food without exhausting myself or risking injury. A moderate intensity of 0.50 allows me to be effective while conserving energy.",
            "I chose this theta because with the current sheep population at 26.59 and a stable wolf population, a lower hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. This strategy minimizes competition with other wolves and increases my chances of survival in a fluctuating environment."
