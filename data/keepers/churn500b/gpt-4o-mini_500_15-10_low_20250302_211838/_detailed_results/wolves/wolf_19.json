            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high compared to the wolf population, and I want to conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt. A lower intensity allows me to avoid overexertion and increases my chances of survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy, as the overall wolf population remains stable. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while also conserving energy. This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity without overexerting myself, which is crucial for my survival."
