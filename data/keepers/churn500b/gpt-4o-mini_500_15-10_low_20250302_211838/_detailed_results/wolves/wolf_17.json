            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and with an increase in the number of wolves, hunting at full intensity may lead to competition and reduced success. A slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means food is becoming scarcer. With an increase in the wolf population, competition for food will be higher. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise. This strategy allows me to adapt to the changing environment and increases my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating that hunting may be more challenging. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can improve my chances of successfully catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively. This balance will help ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the wolf population is still high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves for limited prey. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves suggests a more competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while conserving energy, as the sheep population is still relatively high. This approach allows me to adapt to the situation without overexerting myself, which is crucial for my survival."
