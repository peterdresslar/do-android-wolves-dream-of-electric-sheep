            "I chose this theta because with an increase in the wolf population, competition for food will be higher. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population decreasing and the number of wolves remaining stable, a slightly lower hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's efforts. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a potentially dwindling food environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making them scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting more competitive among wolves. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of securing food while still conserving energy. This balance is crucial for my survival in a changing environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. By lowering my intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, especially since the number of wolves has remained stable. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, which means there is a good opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. By increasing my intensity slightly from my previous theta, I can take advantage of the situation while still conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 10 wolves competing for food, a slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This balance increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself."
