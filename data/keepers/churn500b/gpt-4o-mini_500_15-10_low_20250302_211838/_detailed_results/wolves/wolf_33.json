            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests competition is fierce. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while conserving energy and avoiding overexertion, which is crucial for survival in a declining wolf population.",

By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can take advantage of the abundant prey while still being cautious of the risks posed by other wolves."
