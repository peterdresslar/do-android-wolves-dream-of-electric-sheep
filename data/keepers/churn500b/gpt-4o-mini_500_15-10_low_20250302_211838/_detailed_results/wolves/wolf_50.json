            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting more challenging. With an increase in the wolf population, competition for food is higher. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to catch prey when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with the wolf population remaining constant, hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. A moderate intensity allows for a more strategic approach, conserving energy while still contributing to the pack's needs.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still conserving energy. This approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity without overexerting myself, which is crucial for my survival.",
