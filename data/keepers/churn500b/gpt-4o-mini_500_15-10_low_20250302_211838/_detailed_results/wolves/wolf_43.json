            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 9 wolves competing for food, hunting at maximum intensity may lead to overexertion and increased risk of injury. By reducing my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because with an increase in the wolf population, competition for food is intensifying. By reducing my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 12 wolves competing for food, a moderate increase in hunting intensity will improve my chances of catching prey without overexerting myself. This balance allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, which means competition for food is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and failure. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting may be less rewarding. By increasing my intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the remaining sheep while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that food is becoming scarcer. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to survive longer while waiting for better conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can take advantage of the situation while still being cautious. This allows me to balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion, ensuring my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the wolf population is also declining. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also struggling. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation while still being able to hunt effectively when necessary.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, allowing me to hunt more strategically when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the wolf population, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity. By increasing my intensity from 0.30 to 0.50, I can take advantage of the available prey while still conserving energy and reducing the risk of overexertion, especially given the recent decrease in the wolf population."
