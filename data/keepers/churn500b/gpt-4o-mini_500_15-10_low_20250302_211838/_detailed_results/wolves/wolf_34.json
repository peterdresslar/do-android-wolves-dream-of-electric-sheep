            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased slightly, indicating a potential for more food. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests competition is fierce, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to overexertion or injury. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. With the wolf population decreasing, a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive in securing food.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with the number of wolves remaining constant, a lower hunting intensity will help ensure that I conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves. This strategy allows me to hunt more efficiently without overexerting myself, increasing my chances of survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 10 wolves competing for food, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still increasing my chances of a successful hunt. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. By adjusting my intensity to 0.70, I can balance the need for food while conserving energy, especially since the number of wolves remains stable. This way, I can still compete effectively with other wolves while ensuring my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 9 wolves competing for food, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective. This way, I can avoid overexertion and increase my chances of survival in the long run."
