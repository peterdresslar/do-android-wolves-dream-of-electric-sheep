With fewer sheep, hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable, and I need to conserve energy for future hunts. A moderate intensity allows me to balance the risk of competing with other wolves while still being able to catch prey.",

However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition is fierce. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can take advantage of the available prey while still being cautious about the risks of overexertion in a dwindling pack."
