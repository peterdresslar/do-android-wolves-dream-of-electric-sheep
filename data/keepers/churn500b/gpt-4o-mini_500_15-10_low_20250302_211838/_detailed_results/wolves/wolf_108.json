            "I chose this theta because with the number of sheep increasing and wolves decreasing, a lower hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still taking advantage of the available prey. This strategy helps ensure my survival by not overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. By increasing my intensity slightly from my previous theta, I can take advantage of the higher number of sheep while still conserving energy compared to maximum intensity. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting. However, with the recent decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I don",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 9 wolves competing for food, a slightly reduced intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself, especially since the other wolves are also hunting at maximum intensity.",
            "I chose this theta because with 35.84 sheep and 9 wolves, the competition for food is moderate. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can maximize my chances of securing food while still being mindful of the need to conserve energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because with 38.16 sheep and 9 wolves, the competition for food is high. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. By raising my intensity to 0.75, I can capitalize on the abundance of prey while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balanced approach helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves is increasing, which means competition for food is rising. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success. This strategy allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics and ensure my survival in a more sustainable way.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 10 wolves competing for food, a moderate increase in hunting intensity will help me secure enough resources without overexerting myself. This balance allows me to adapt to the current situation while still being cautious.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves. By reducing my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still contributing to the pack",

By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's overall success. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a potentially scarce environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the increased number of wolves. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population increasing and the number of wolves remaining constant, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to balance the need for food while also conserving energy. This way, I can adapt to the changing environment and ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, which means food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival as the competition among wolves increases.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with the number of wolves remaining the same, hunting at maximum intensity may lead to overexploitation of the remaining sheep. A moderate intensity allows for a sustainable approach, ensuring I can still hunt effectively while giving the sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating less food availability. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, ensuring my survival in a challenging environment.",
