            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the overall population of wolves is also declining. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This balanced approach increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and with the recent decrease in wolf population, a lower hunting intensity will help me conserve energy while still allowing for a chance to catch prey. This strategy balances the need for food with the risk of overexertion in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, while the wolf population has decreased. A moderate hunting intensity allows me to balance the need for food with the risk of overexerting myself in a declining wolf population. This way, I can still hunt effectively while conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, but the wolf population has decreased. This suggests that hunting at a lower intensity may be more sustainable, allowing me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, with the decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still secure food without overexerting myself or risking confrontation with other wolves. A theta of 0.50 allows me to hunt effectively while conserving energy."
