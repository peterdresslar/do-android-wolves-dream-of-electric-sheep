            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making them more scarce. With an increase in the wolf population, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and risk of failure. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of catching enough prey while still conserving energy, as the competition with other wolves remains constant.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, but the wolf population has decreased. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who may be hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to ensure my survival while still taking advantage of the available prey.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition is still present. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can take advantage of the sheep while still being cautious about the risks posed by other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 13 wolves competing for food, hunting at a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. By increasing my intensity to 0.70, I can take advantage of the higher prey availability while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself, especially since the number of wolves remains constant.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, but the number of wolves has decreased. A moderate hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still taking advantage of the available prey. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a potentially competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with the number of wolves remaining stable, I can afford to hunt at a lower intensity. This will help conserve energy and reduce competition with other wolves, while still allowing for a successful hunt.",
            "I chose this theta because with 33.25 sheep and 11 wolves, the competition for food is moderate. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure enough food while conserving energy. This approach allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself, considering the stable number of wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 11 wolves competing for food, a moderate hunting intensity will allow me to secure enough resources while avoiding overexertion. This balance helps ensure my survival without risking depletion of the sheep population too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 11 wolves competing for food, hunting at a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a more cautious approach. By increasing my hunting intensity from my previous theta of 0.50 to 0.75, I can take advantage of the available prey while still being mindful of the competition from other wolves. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still contributing to the pack's overall success. This strategy allows me to survive longer in a situation where resources are plentiful but competition is increasing.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased slightly, which means there is more food available. However, with the number of wolves remaining the same, competition for that food is still high. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can take advantage of the increased sheep population while still being cautious not to overexert myself, ensuring my survival in this competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid drawing attention to myself, while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival in a crowded environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with an increase in the number of wolves, competition for food will be higher. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a potentially scarce environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, which means there is enough food available. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are likely to hunt at maximum intensity. This strategy increases my chances of survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively when necessary. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased slightly, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity from 0.30 to 0.40, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy, as the competition with other wolves remains constant. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting more challenging. By increasing my intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of a successful hunt while still conserving energy for future hunts, especially with the growing number of wolves competing for the same prey.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can maximize my chances of catching enough food while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival as the competition among wolves remains constant.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that food is becoming scarcer. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and increase my chances of survival while still being able to hunt effectively. This approach allows me to adapt to the changing environment and avoid overexertion.",
