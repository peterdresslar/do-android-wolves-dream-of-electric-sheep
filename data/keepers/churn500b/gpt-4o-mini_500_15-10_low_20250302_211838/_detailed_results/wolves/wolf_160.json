            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, and with fewer sheep, I need to conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively. A slightly higher intensity than before allows me to adapt to the situation without overexerting myself, ensuring my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.30, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy, as the competition with other wolves remains constant. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because with the number of sheep decreasing, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food while conserving energy. A moderate intensity allows me to adapt to the changing environment and avoid overexertion, which could be detrimental if the sheep population continues to decline.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, and with 22 wolves competing for food, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough prey without exhausting myself. A slightly higher intensity than before will help me adapt to the current situation while still being mindful of energy conservation.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the competition among wolves is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the hunt when necessary. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the declining wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased slightly, indicating a potential for more food. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests competition is fierce. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can take advantage of the available prey while still being cautious about overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, but the wolf population has decreased. This suggests that competition for food is less intense, allowing me to hunt at a lower intensity while still being effective. By conserving energy, I can ensure my survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, with the recent decrease in the wolf population, I need to be cautious and not overexert myself. A moderate intensity allows me to hunt effectively while conserving energy and ensuring my survival."
