            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the increased number of wolves. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still being part of the hunt when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the situation without overexerting myself, which could lead to unnecessary risks. This balance allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. With more wolves in the area, hunting at a higher intensity could lead to competition and overexertion. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still increasing my chances of a successful hunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential failure. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, and with 23 wolves competing for food, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a potentially dwindling food situation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly from my previous theta of 0.65 to 0.75, I can improve my chances of catching enough prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This strategy allows me to adapt to the changing environment and increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my intensity to 0.75, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival as the competition with other wolves remains high.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the decreased wolf population. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competing aggressively with other wolves, which may be struggling. This approach allows me to hunt more strategically and increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests competition is fierce, and I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food without exhausting myself or risking injury. A theta of 0.75 allows me to hunt effectively while being mindful of the current dynamics.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, which means there is more food available. However, with the number of wolves remaining the same, I want to ensure I don't overexert myself and risk injury or exhaustion. A slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting."
