            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased significantly, which means competition for food is higher. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a crowded environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the wolf population is increasing. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can balance my energy expenditure while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the wolf population is increasing. A lower hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively when necessary.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion, allowing me to adapt to the current situation while still being cautious.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in the wolf population indicates increased competition for food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can maximize my chances of securing enough food while still being cautious not to overexert myself, given the recent trends.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, but the wolf population has decreased. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and reduce competition with other wolves while still contributing to the hunt. This balanced approach helps ensure my survival in a fluctuating environment."
