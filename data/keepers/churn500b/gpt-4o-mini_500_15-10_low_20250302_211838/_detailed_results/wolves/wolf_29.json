            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making them a scarcer resource. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and risk. By increasing my intensity slightly, I can still contribute to the pack's success while managing my energy and avoiding overexertion.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and failure. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, while the wolf population has decreased significantly. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who may be hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and ensure my survival while still taking advantage of the available prey.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, with the recent decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food while conserving energy and avoiding competition with other wolves. A moderate intensity of 0.50 allows me to be effective without overexerting myself."
