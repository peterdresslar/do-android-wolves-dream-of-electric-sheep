This balance allows me to maintain energy for future hunts while still being competitive.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population increasing and the number of wolves remaining the same, a lower hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success. This way, I can avoid overexertion and ensure my survival in a potentially competitive environment."
