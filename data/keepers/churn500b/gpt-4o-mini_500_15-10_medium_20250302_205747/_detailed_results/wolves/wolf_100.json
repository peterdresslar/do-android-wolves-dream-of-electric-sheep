            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can allow the sheep to replenish while maintaining a sustainable wolf population. This gradual adjustment will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help the sheep population stabilize and gradually increase, ensuring long-term survival for both species. This small adjustment allows for a more sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 3.40, which is only 0.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. This will help balance the competition among wolves and prevent over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I need to focus on hunting to ensure the survival of my pack, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance, promoting sustainability without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.4% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are not enough sheep to sustain aggressive hunting. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution in hunting to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta will enable me to maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves while still allowing the sheep population to stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 5.09, which is only 0.5% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase in hunting intensity from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep further, as they are already struggling. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 5.50, which is only 0.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of both populations. It also reflects the need to compete with other wolves, as our population is relatively small.",
