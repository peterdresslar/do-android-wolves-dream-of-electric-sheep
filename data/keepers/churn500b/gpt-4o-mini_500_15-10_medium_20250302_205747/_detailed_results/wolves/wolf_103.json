            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 75\n- Sheep population: 20.71\n- Wolf population: 1.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.400\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 20.71 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 2.1% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to repopulate while also managing competition with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 0.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that aggressive hunting would further deplete the sheep, risking their long-term survival. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while still competing with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.3% of its maximum capacity. Increasing hunting intensity could lead to a collapse of the sheep population, which would ultimately harm the wolf population as well. A theta of 0.30 allows for a slight focus on competition with other wolves while still enabling the sheep to recover, promoting a more sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating a critical need for recovery. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to replenish their numbers while also ensuring that the wolf population does not deplete too quickly. This balanced approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution in hunting. While I want to ensure the survival of my pack, I must also allow the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term balance of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help the sheep population stabilize and gradually increase, ensuring a sustainable ecosystem for both wolves and sheep in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.4% of its maximum capacity, and my previous theta of 0.300 was already focused on competition with other wolves. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I will gradually increase my hunting intensity to allow for some recovery in the sheep population while still being cautious not to overhunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are not enough sheep to sustain aggressive hunting. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining the wolf population in a more sustainable manner.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 5.50, which is only 0.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is a need to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support the wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the long-term balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 5.96, which is only 0.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking the depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 6.46, which is only 0.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",

This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can help the sheep population stabilize while still allowing for some hunting to maintain the wolf population. This moderate approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.13, which is only 0.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is an opportunity to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A small increase to 0.40 maintains a cautious approach, balancing the need for sustenance with the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution in hunting. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from the previous theta of 0.40 to 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing the sheep population to recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",

This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to gradually increase. This approach aligns with my objective of ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.93, which is only 1.2% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will help me maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.08, which is only 1.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure and give the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, while also allowing the wolf population to stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.35, which is only 1.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is an opportunity for the sheep to recover, and a slight increase in hunting intensity will allow for some reproduction among wolves while still giving sheep a chance to bounce back. A gradual adjustment is key to maintaining balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.73, which is only 1.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover.
