            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 2.83, which is only 0.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to bounce back.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and my previous theta was already on the lower end. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for a modest increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment helps maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 3.22, which is only 0.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are in a vulnerable state, and focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep population to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 3.40, which is only 0.3% of its maximum capacity. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This approach supports long-term sustainability and prevents a crash in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.4% of its maximum capacity, which indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance while still allowing for some hunting to support our wolf population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and ensures the long-term survival of both species."
