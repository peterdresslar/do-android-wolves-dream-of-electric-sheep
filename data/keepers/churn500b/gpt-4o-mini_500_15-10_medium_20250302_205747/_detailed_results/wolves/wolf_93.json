            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 3.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a high level of competition among wolves. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also reducing competition among wolves, ensuring a more sustainable ecosystem in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a high level of competition among wolves. By reducing my hunting intensity further, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing the competition among my fellow wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and my previous theta was already focused on competition rather than hunting. By maintaining a low hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing the wolf population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of ensuring long-term survival and avoiding sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and my previous theta was focused on competition rather than hunting. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for a gradual increase in hunting intensity, which can help stabilize the sheep population while still being cautious about overhunting. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can allow the sheep population to stabilize and grow, ensuring long-term survival for both species. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance."
