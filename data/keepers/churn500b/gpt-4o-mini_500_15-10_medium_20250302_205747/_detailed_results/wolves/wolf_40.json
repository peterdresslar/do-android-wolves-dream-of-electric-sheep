            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for some increased hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover gradually.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 74.54, which is only 7.5% of its maximum capacity. While I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. A moderate increase to 0.65 allows for sustainable hunting while still considering the need for sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we are overhunting. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also addressing the competition among wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem."
