            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 31\n- Sheep population: 148.26\n- Wolf population: 17.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.773\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 8.72 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 14.8% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level (14.8% of maximum capacity), allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This value strikes a balance between ensuring the wolf population can thrive while still allowing the sheep to recover over time. It reflects a cautious yet proactive approach to maintaining ecosystem stability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 48.96, which is only 4.9% of its maximum capacity. While I want to maintain a healthy wolf population, I need to be cautious about overhunting. A moderate theta of 0.55 allows for some hunting to support reproduction while still giving the sheep a chance to recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem."
