            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.7% of its maximum capacity, and with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.18, it is crucial to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure and give the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.3% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. A gradual increase in theta will help balance the ecosystem without causing a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.3% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus more on reducing competition with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A gradual increase in theta will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and my previous theta was already low at 0.25. To allow the sheep to recover and avoid depleting their numbers further, I will maintain a focus on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting. This gradual adjustment will help ensure the long-term survival of both species."
