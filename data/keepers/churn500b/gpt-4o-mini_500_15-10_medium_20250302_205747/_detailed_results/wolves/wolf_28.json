            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 40\n- Sheep population: 10.45\n- Wolf population: 86.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.930\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.12 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 1.0% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity. While my previous theta was high, indicating intense hunting, I need to shift towards a more balanced approach to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.60 will help maintain my wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to increase, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By focusing more on competition with other wolves rather than hunting sheep, I can help the sheep population stabilize and gradually increase, ensuring long-term survival for both species."
