            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 29.58, which is only 3.0% of its maximum capacity. While my previous theta of 0.684 indicates a focus on hunting, I need to shift towards a more balanced approach to allow the sheep population to recover. A moderate theta of 0.5 will help maintain a sustainable coexistence while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 0.7% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to rebound.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.3% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. Maintaining a lower theta allows the sheep to recover while preventing overcompetition among wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and ensures the long-term survival of both species."
