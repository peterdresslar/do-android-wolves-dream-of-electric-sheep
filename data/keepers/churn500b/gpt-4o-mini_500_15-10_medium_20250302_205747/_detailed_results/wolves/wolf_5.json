            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.77, which is only 1.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.40 strikes a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can grow, promoting long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.75, which is only 1.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 allows for a slight focus on competition with other wolves while still maintaining some hunting to support our population, ensuring a balance that promotes long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are not enough sheep to sustain aggressive hunting. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can help ensure that the wolf population stabilizes while allowing the sheep to recover. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.38, which is only 2.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should be cautious with our hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will help maintain a balance while still allowing for some hunting to support our wolf population. It\u2019s important to avoid overhunting at this stage to ensure long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.93, which is only 2.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is potential for recovery in the sheep population if I reduce hunting intensity slightly. A theta of 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, enabling me to maintain a healthy wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to recover without depleting their numbers too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at only 2.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity and promote a sustainable balance, while still allowing for some competition among wolves."
