            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a high level of competition among wolves. By slightly increasing my theta, I can focus more on hunting to help sustain my pack, but I must do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. This gradual increase allows for a balance that supports both populations over time.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.4% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a potential risk of overhunting. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing competition with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and promotes long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and my previous theta was already on the lower end. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for a modest increase in hunting intensity, which can help support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep further. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance."
