            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.3% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while still giving the sheep a chance to recover. A balanced approach is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly and to ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain our wolf population while still giving the sheep a chance to recover. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, allowing for some hunting without risking depletion. However, with the wolf population being relatively small, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite high at 18.51. This suggests that while there is an opportunity for hunting, it is crucial to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the long-term balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This will help support wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery. A gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining balance and responding to population trends.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 14.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 34, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure our long-term survival. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that supports both sheep recovery and wolf population health.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 29.58, which is only 3.0% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting intensively. A lower theta will help maintain the sheep population while still allowing for some hunting to support our own needs."
