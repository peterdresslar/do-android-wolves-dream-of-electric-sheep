            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 120.29, which is only 12.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A moderate theta of 0.48 helps maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, allowing for some hunting without risking depletion. However, with the wolf population being relatively small, I want to maintain a balance that supports both species. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite high at 6.25. This indicates that while there is an opportunity for hunting, it is essential to prioritize the recovery of the sheep population to ensure long-term sustainability. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while also focusing on competition with other wolves, which can help stabilize our population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.35, which is only 1.7% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable balance, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting intensely. This will help maintain the sheep population while also allowing for a gradual adjustment in my hunting strategy as conditions change."
