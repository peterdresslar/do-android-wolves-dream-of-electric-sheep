            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 29\n- Sheep population: 137.24\n- Wolf population: 9.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.285\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 15.25 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 13.7% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.7% of maximum capacity, and my previous theta was quite low at 0.285. A gradual increase to 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to help sustain my pack while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.8% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations while ensuring our pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is quite low at 3.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to stabilize while still competing with other wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem."
