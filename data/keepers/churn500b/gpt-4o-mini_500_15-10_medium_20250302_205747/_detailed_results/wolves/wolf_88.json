            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 74.54, which is only 7.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.352 allows for a balanced approach that supports wolf reproduction while still being mindful of the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help the sheep population stabilize and gradually increase, ensuring long-term survival for both species. This approach aligns with the wisdom of making small adjustments and maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 2.90, which is just 0.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population, which is essential for the future of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to replenish while still competing with other wolves. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both populations."
