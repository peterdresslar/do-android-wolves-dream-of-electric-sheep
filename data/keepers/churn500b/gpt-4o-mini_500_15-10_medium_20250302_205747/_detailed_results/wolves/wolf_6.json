By setting a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to gradually increase while maintaining a stable wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.38, which is only 2.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need to compete with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.93, which is only 2.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support our wolf population without risking the depletion of the sheep, ensuring a sustainable balance.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.41, which is only 2.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.4 to 0.35 reflects a balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population. This strategy aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and sustainable coexistence.",

This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
