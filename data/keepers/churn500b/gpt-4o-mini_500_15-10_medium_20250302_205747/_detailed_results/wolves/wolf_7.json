            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while it is important to maintain some hunting to support our reproduction, I need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring that both wolves and sheep can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.98, which is only 1.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. A lower theta allows me to focus more on competing with other wolves, which will help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to increase. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.93, which is only 2.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.58, which is only 2.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting without over-depleting the sheep, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.41, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.45, which is only 2.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help ensure a sustainable balance while still keeping an eye on the sheep population",
