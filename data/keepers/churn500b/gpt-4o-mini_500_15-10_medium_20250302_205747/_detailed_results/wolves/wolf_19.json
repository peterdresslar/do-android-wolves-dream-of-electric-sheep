            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 30\n- Sheep population: 143.67\n- Wolf population: 13.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.075\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 11.05 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 14.4% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and my previous theta was quite low, indicating a focus on competition with other wolves. To allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a presence in the ecosystem, a slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted. This adjustment will help balance the needs of both populations without risking a rapid depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.35, which is only 1.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.30 represents a moderate approach that balances competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring the long-term survival of both species."
