            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.0% of maximum capacity, indicating that they are vulnerable. While my previous theta of 0.835 was effective for hunting, it is now crucial to shift towards a more balanced approach to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.65 will enable me to maintain some hunting intensity while also considering the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.3% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can help create a more sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.3% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a significant scarcity of prey. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep population to recover while also preventing overcompetition among wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and ensures the long-term survival of both species."
