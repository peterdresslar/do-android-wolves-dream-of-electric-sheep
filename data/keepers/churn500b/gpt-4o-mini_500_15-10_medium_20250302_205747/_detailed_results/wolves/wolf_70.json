            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 6.83, which is only 0.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are struggling, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to recover. Additionally, with a wolf population of 76, focusing on competition among wolves rather than intense hunting will help maintain our numbers while giving the sheep a chance to rebound. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid sudden population crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.3% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.3% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. This lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash."
