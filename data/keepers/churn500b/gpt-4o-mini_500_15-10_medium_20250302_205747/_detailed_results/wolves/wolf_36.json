            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This value will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing for some recovery of the sheep, maintaining a balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 74.54, which is only 7.5% of its maximum capacity. While I want to maintain a healthy wolf population, I also recognize the need to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.65 allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still being mindful of the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 48.96, which is only 4.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to rebuild their numbers. Additionally, with the wolf population at 95, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 29.58, which is only 3.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both populations, aligning with the wisdom of gradual adjustments."
