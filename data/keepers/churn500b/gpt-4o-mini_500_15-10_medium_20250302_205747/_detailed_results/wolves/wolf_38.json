            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 33\n- Sheep population: 144.62\n- Wolf population: 34.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.247\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 4.25 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 14.5% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.5% of maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are more sheep available relative to wolves. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still focusing on the long-term sustainability of both populations. A moderate approach will help maintain balance and prevent over-depletion of sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.9% of maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are more sheep available per wolf. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a bit more hunting to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious to avoid over-depleting the sheep population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.7% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a sustainable wolf population. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of my ancestors, ensuring the long-term survival of both species."
