            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. A gradual increase in theta is necessary as conditions improve, but for now, a lower value will help stabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.3% of its maximum capacity. With the current sheep-to-wolf ratio being very low, it is essential to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity and give the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.3% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. This indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover rather than intensifying hunting. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population."
