A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while ensuring that the wolf population does not deplete the sheep further. This cautious approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence.",

By reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing the wolf population, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. A gradual decrease in theta will help maintain a balance while avoiding sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and a cautious approach is necessary to allow them to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from the previous theta, I can still maintain some level of reproduction among wolves while prioritizing the sustainability of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment helps avoid drastic impacts on both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable.
