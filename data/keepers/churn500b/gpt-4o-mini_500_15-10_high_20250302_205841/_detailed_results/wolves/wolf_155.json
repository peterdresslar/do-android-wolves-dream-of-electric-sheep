            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while there are many sheep per wolf, we need to be cautious to avoid depleting their numbers further. A moderate increase in hunting intensity allows for some growth in wolf population while giving sheep a chance to recover.",

By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while allowing the sheep population to stabilize."
