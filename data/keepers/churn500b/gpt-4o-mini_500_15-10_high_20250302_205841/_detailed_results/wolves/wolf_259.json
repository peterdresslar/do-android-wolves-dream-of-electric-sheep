By setting theta at 0.5, I can maintain hunting intensity at a sustainable level while allowing sheep numbers to recover. This will help ensure the long-term survival of both species and prevent a crash in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. By reducing hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution in hunting. With the wolf population at 7.00, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and while I want to ensure the survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to be cautious about hunting intensity. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some growth in the wolf population while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep."
