            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A moderate hunting intensity will allow for some reproduction while giving sheep a chance to recover. This approach balances the immediate need for sustenance with the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for a balanced approach. By setting theta at 0.500, I can maintain some hunting intensity to support reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. This gradual adjustment helps avoid overexploitation and promotes long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. By focusing on reducing hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments to maintain balance in the ecosystem."
