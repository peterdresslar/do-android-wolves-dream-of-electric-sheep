            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating that competition among wolves is increasing. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure on the sheep, allowing their numbers to recover while we manage our own population dynamics. This gradual adjustment will help maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover while also managing the high wolf population. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that aggressive hunting could lead to a collapse of the sheep population, which would ultimately threaten our own survival. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while still competing with other wolves for resources. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to their collapse. Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves, ensuring our long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and while I need to ensure my pack's survival, I must prioritize the recovery of the sheep. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, which will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem.",
