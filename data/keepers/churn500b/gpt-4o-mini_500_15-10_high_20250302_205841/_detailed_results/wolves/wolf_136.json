A small increase in theta will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and with the wolf population being high, it is essential to prioritize the recovery of the sheep. A lower theta allows for reduced hunting intensity, giving the sheep a chance to rebound while also managing competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on reducing competition among wolves, which is essential for long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. A gradual adjustment will help maintain balance without risking a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. A slight increase in hunting intensity is necessary to support wolf reproduction, but I must be cautious to avoid further depleting the sheep population. This adjustment allows for a gradual response to the ecosystem",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution in hunting. With the wolf population also being relatively low, a moderate approach allows for some hunting while giving sheep a chance to recover. This balance supports long-term sustainability for both species."
