A slight reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, ensuring the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while the wolf population is also low, it is important to prioritize the recovery of the sheep. A lower theta allows for competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to stabilize and grow, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while my wolf pack is small, I need to prioritize the long-term survival of both species. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious to avoid depleting the sheep population further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, and while the wolf population is low, it is crucial to prioritize the long-term balance of the ecosystem. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also reducing competition among wolves, which will help ensure our survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that a more cautious approach is needed to allow for recovery. While the wolf population is low, I want to ensure that we do not over-hunt the sheep, which could lead to a crash in both populations. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the sustainability of the ecosystem.",
