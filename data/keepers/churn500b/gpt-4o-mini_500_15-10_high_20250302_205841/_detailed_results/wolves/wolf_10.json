            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and there are many sheep per wolf, indicating that we can increase our hunting intensity without jeopardizing the long-term survival of either species. However, I will adjust it moderately to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly and to allow for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, indicating a need for more hunting to maintain balance. However, with the wolf population being relatively low, I want to avoid overexploitation of the sheep and ensure sustainable growth for both species. A moderate increase in hunting intensity allows for a cautious approach while still promoting wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently high relative to the wolf population, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still being cautious of the sheep numbers, ensuring we do not deplete their population too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, indicating a need for increased hunting to ensure sustainability. However, given the relatively low wolf population, I want to avoid overexploitation of the sheep and allow for gradual growth in both populations. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain balance without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently high relative to the wolf population, allowing for a more intense hunting strategy without risking immediate depletion. This adjustment will help increase our numbers while still being mindful of the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, indicating a need for cautious hunting to prevent overpopulation. However, with a relatively low wolf population, I want to ensure we can grow without depleting the sheep too quickly. A moderate theta allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that we need to be cautious with our hunting. While there are many sheep per wolf, the current state suggests that a slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling us to compete effectively with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low at only 10.1% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting sheep. This will allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a healthy balance in the ecosystem.",
