            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep. By adopting a moderate hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This approach also acknowledges the high wolf population, which necessitates caution to avoid overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing the competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem."
