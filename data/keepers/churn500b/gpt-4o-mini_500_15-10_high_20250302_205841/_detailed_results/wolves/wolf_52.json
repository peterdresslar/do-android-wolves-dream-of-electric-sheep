            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for a balanced approach. By setting theta at 0.50, I can maintain hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. This adjustment helps ensure long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta allows for more focus on reducing competition and giving sheep a chance to recover, which is essential for long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. By reducing hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a balance in the ecosystem."
