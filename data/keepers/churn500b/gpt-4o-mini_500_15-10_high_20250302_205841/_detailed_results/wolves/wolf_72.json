However, I must remain cautious and avoid drastic changes, as the wolf population is still low, and I want to maintain a balance that allows for both wolf growth and sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that while I can still hunt, I need to be cautious to avoid depleting their numbers further. A moderate approach allows for some hunting while still considering the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that while I can increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate increase allows for a balance between hunting and ensuring the sheep can recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, indicating a need for caution in hunting to prevent depletion. However, with a low wolf population, I can afford to increase hunting slightly to support our growth. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring both wolves and sheep can thrive without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A moderate increase allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some growth in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, indicating the need for a moderate hunting approach to prevent overpopulation while allowing for some growth in the wolf population. This value balances the need for hunting with the necessity of maintaining sustainable sheep numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, allowing for increased hunting intensity without risking immediate depletion. However, I must remain cautious as the wolf population is low, and I want to ensure sustainable coexistence. A moderate increase in theta allows for growth in the wolf population while still considering the health of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently high, and with a low wolf population, there is an opportunity to increase hunting intensity without jeopardizing the long-term balance. A theta of 0.60 allows for sustainable hunting while still being cautious about the sheep numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, indicating a need for increased hunting to prevent overpopulation. However, with a relatively low wolf population, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep too quickly. A moderate increase allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling the wolf population to grow.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 18 sheep per wolf, there is room for increased hunting intensity. However, I must remain cautious as the sheep numbers are concerning, so a moderate increase to 0.60 allows for sustainable hunting while still considering the long-term balance of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, indicating that while I can increase my hunting intensity, I must do so cautiously to avoid depleting their numbers too quickly. A moderate increase allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling the wolf population to grow.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and a more cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the ecosystem while ensuring that the sheep have a chance to rebound. This moderate adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is relatively high, indicating increased competition. A moderate approach will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain their numbers. This gradual adjustment helps avoid drastic impacts on the ecosystem."
