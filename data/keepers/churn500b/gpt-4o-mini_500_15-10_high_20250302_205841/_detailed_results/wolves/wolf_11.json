            "I chose this theta because it represents a balanced approach to hunting that allows for sustainable coexistence. The sheep population is concerningly low, and while there are many sheep per wolf, I need to be cautious to avoid depleting their numbers too quickly. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will support wolf population growth while still allowing sheep to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and there are many sheep per wolf, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, I must remain cautious as the sheep numbers are concerning, and I want to ensure a sustainable balance without depleting their population too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the wolf population, allowing for a sustainable increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still being cautious of the sheep numbers, which are concerning. A moderate increase to 0.60 allows for growth without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, indicating a need for more hunting to prevent overpopulation and ensure sustainability. However, given the relatively low wolf population, I want to avoid drastic changes and maintain a balance that allows for gradual growth in both populations. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help manage the sheep numbers while still allowing for wolf population stability.",
            "I chose this theta because while the sheep population is concerningly low, there are still many sheep per wolf, indicating that we can afford a moderate hunting intensity. This value allows for a cautious approach to hunting, ensuring the sheep can recover while still supporting our wolf population. It reflects a balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep, promoting long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while also helping to stabilize the wolf population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes."
