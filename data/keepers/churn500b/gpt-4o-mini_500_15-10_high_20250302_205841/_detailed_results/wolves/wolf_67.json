            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves.

A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain their numbers. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments to ensure long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. By reducing hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while managing competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need to focus on competition among wolves rather than hunting sheep. This will allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a balance within the wolf pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A cautious approach is necessary to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining some hunting to support the wolf population. This gradual adjustment helps prevent overexploitation of the sheep and ensures a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution in hunting. With the wolf population also being relatively low, a moderate approach allows for some hunting while still enabling sheep recovery. This balance supports both our growth and the sustainability of the ecosystem.",
