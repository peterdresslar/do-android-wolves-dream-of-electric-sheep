            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution in hunting. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain our numbers while allowing the sheep to recover. This approach balances our immediate needs with the long-term health of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution in hunting to allow sheep to recover. A moderate approach will help maintain balance and prevent overexploitation of the sheep while also addressing the competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta allows the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting, which is crucial for maintaining our population. This gradual adjustment helps ensure a sustainable balance in the ecosystem."
