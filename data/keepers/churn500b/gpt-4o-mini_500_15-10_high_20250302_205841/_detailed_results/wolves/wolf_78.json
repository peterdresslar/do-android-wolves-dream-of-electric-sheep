A moderate hunting intensity allows for some sheep recovery while still enabling wolves to thrive. This balance is crucial to avoid depleting the sheep further.",

By lowering my hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both the sheep and the wolf population, while still maintaining some level of competition with other wolves.",
