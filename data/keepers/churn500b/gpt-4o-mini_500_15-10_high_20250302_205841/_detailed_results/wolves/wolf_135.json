This gradual adjustment will help prevent overhunting and ensure long-term survival for both species.",

A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on reducing competition among ourselves. This cautious approach aligns with the need for long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and a more cautious approach is needed to allow them to recover. While the wolf population is moderately high, increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in sheep, jeopardizing the long-term survival of both species. A small increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable.

This cautious approach will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable.

This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a balance and avoiding drastic changes.",
