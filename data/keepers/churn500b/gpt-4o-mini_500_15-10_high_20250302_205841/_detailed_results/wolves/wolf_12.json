            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for increased hunting without risking immediate depletion. However, given the current concerns about sheep numbers and the low wolf population, a moderate increase in hunting intensity will help sustain our pack while allowing for some recovery of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating a need for caution in hunting. A moderate approach allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some hunting to support the wolf population. This balance will help prevent a crash in the sheep population and ensure long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and with a high sheep-to-wolf ratio, it is crucial to prioritize the recovery of the sheep. A moderate hunting intensity allows for some hunting while also giving the sheep a chance to rebound, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A moderate hunting intensity will allow sheep to recover while still enabling wolves to maintain their numbers. This approach aligns with the need for a sustainable balance in the ecosystem."
