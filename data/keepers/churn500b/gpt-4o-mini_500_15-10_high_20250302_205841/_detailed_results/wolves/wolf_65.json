            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution in hunting. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while also enabling the sheep to recover, promoting a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in our ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we compete with other wolves, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover. A gradual decrease in theta will help stabilize the ecosystem without causing sudden population crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. A gradual increase in hunting intensity is necessary to support wolf reproduction, but I must remain cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. This moderate adjustment allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating that a more cautious approach is needed to allow their numbers to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while ensuring the sheep have a chance to stabilize. This aligns with the goal of sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution in hunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach helps maintain a balance as the wolf population is currently low, and I want to avoid depleting the sheep further."
