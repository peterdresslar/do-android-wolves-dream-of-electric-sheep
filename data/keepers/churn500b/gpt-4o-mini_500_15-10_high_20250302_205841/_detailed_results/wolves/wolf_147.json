            "I chose this theta because, while the sheep population is concerningly low, there are still many sheep per wolf, indicating that we can afford to hunt moderately. A slight reduction from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach, ensuring that we do not deplete the sheep population too quickly while still allowing for some hunting to support our wolf pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating that competition among wolves is increasing. A moderate theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting, giving sheep a chance to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta allows for a focus on reducing competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover. This approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence and prevents overhunting."
