            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and with a high wolf population, competition is increasing. A lower theta allows the sheep to recover while we focus on reducing competition among ourselves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and with the current high wolf population, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. A gradual decrease in theta will help stabilize the ecosystem without causing sudden shifts that could lead to crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and my previous focus on competition has not allowed for sustainable growth. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help balance the ecosystem while still being cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. This approach allows for gradual adaptation to the current conditions."
