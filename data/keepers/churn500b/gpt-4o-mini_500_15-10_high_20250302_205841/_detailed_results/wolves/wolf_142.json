By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can allow the sheep population to recover while ensuring the wolf pack remains sustainable. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution in hunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This moderate approach helps maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution. With the current sheep-to-wolf ratio being high, it is wise to focus on competition among wolves to allow the sheep population to recover. This approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and while I want to ensure the wolf population can grow, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population."
