            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.

However, I want to be cautious and avoid overhunting, so I am only slightly increasing my hunting intensity to maintain a balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, indicating a need for cautious hunting to prevent overpopulation while still allowing for some growth in the wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.55 allows for a balanced approach, ensuring sustainable coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and the wolf population is low, allowing for a sustainable increase in hunting intensity. This will help us capitalize on the current abundance of sheep while still being cautious to avoid over-depletion. A gradual increase to 0.60 strikes a balance between hunting and ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating a need for caution in hunting. While there are many sheep per wolf, the current state suggests a balanced approach is necessary to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta will help ensure sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and a more cautious approach is needed to allow their numbers to recover. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help stabilize both populations and ensure long-term survival."
