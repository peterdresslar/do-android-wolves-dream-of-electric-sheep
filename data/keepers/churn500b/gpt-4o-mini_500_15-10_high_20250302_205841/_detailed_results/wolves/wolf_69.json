This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while I want to ensure the wolf population can grow, I must prioritize the long-term survival of both species. A slight increase in hunting intensity allows for some growth while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep further."
