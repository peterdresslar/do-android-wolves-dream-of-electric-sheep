            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for increased hunting without immediate risk of depletion. However, given the current low wolf population, I want to ensure that we can sustain our numbers while still benefiting from the available sheep. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help balance our growth with the sheep population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help support wolf reproduction while ensuring that the sheep population does not decline too rapidly. A gradual adjustment is key to maintaining balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for sustainable hunting without risking depletion. However, given the current wolf population is low, a slight reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain our numbers while still allowing for some growth in sheep population. This balance supports both immediate needs and long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A moderate hunting intensity will allow for some sheep recovery while still supporting the wolf population. This balance is crucial for long-term sustainability."
