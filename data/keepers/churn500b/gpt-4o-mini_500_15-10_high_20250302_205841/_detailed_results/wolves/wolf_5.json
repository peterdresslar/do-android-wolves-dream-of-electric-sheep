            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution.

A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, given the current low wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also considering the growth potential of our wolf pack. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments to ensure long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating a need for caution in hunting. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from the previous theta of 0.30 to 0.35, I can still focus on competing with other wolves while allowing for some sustainable hunting. This approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while the wolf population is also low, it is crucial to allow the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help maintain a balance, ensuring that both populations can thrive in the long term without depleting the sheep further.",
