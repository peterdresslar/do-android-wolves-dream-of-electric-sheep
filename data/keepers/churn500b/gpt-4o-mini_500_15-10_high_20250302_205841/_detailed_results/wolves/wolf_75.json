            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and the wolf population is low, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment aims to promote wolf reproduction while ensuring that the sheep population does not decline too rapidly. A balanced approach will help maintain the ecosystem",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently high, and with a low wolf population, there is an opportunity to increase hunting intensity without risking immediate depletion of the sheep. A theta of 0.60 allows for a balanced approach that supports wolf reproduction while still being mindful of the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while there are many sheep per wolf, we need to be cautious to avoid depleting their numbers too quickly. A moderate approach allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some hunting to support our wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still maintaining a presence in the ecosystem. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species."
