A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain its health. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and with the wolf population being quite high, it is essential to focus on reducing competition among wolves. This lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure on the sheep, allowing them to recover while we manage our own numbers more sustainably.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity. Increasing hunting intensity could lead to a collapse of the sheep population, which would ultimately harm the wolf population as well. Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover while we focus on competition with other wolves, ensuring a more sustainable balance.",

By reducing my hunting intensity further, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species and allow the sheep population to stabilize before considering any increase in hunting.",
