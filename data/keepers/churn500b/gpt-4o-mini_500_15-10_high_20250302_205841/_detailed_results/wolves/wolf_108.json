            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for a more balanced approach. By slightly reducing hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining enough hunting to support the wolf population. This adjustment aims for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution in hunting to allow sheep to recover. A moderate theta value will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure on the sheep, allowing their numbers to recover while still enabling some hunting to maintain our population. This approach aligns with the need for a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep. By reducing hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species and allow the sheep population to stabilize. This cautious approach will also help mitigate competition among wolves as we adapt to the changing conditions."
