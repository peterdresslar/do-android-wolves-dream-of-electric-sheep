            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution in hunting. A moderate theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while also giving sheep a chance to recover. This balance is crucial for the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This cautious approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This cautious approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual decrease in theta will help stabilize the ecosystem without causing sudden changes that could lead to crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting, enabling some reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover. A gradual decrease in theta will help stabilize the ecosystem without causing sudden population crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance and avoids overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. This cautious approach will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating that a cautious approach is needed to allow their numbers to recover. While the wolf population is also low, I want to avoid overhunting and ensure a sustainable balance. A gradual increase from my previous theta allows for adaptation without sudden impacts on the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution in hunting. While the wolf population is also low, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while I want to allow for some hunting to support wolf reproduction, I must prioritize the sustainability of the sheep population. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves as the wolf population is relatively low."
