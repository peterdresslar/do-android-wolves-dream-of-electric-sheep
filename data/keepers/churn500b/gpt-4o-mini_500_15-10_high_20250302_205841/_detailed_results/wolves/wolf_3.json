            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep population to recover while ensuring our pack remains strong. This cautious approach aligns with the need for long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the growing sheep numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and promotes long-term sustainability."
