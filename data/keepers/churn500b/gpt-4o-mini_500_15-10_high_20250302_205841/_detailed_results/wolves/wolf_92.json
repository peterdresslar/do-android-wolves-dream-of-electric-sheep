            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to sustain themselves. This balance is crucial for the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating that increased competition among wolves could be detrimental. A moderate theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting, giving sheep a chance to recover while still maintaining some hunting activity to support wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, we can allow the sheep population to stabilize while managing the wolf population sustainably."
