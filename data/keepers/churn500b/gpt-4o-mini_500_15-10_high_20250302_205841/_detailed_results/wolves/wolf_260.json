            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus more on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This cautious approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and a higher hunting intensity could lead to their depletion. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.20 to 0.25, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover, ensuring a more sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and while the wolf population is also low, it is essential to prioritize the recovery of the sheep. A moderate hunting intensity allows for some growth in the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to recover without depleting them further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and while I need to ensure the wolf population can grow, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta will enable me to maintain some hunting pressure while still being cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. This balance will help sustain both populations in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution in hunting. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to recover while ensuring our own survival. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and sustainable coexistence."
