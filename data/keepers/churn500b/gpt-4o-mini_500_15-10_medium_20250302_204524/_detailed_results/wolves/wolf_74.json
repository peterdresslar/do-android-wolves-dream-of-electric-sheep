            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution in hunting. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.20 to 0.25, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.3% of its maximum capacity. Increasing hunting intensity could lead to a further decline in sheep, jeopardizing the long-term survival of both species. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population a chance to recover."
