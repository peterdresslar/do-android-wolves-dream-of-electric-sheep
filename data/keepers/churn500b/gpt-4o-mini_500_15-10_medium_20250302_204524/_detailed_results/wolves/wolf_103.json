            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 45.53, which is only 4.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while also prioritizing the sustainability of the sheep population. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their depletion. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a sustainable wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.3% of its maximum capacity, which indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. While my previous theta was 0.300, a slight increase to 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach, enabling some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both populations. This small adjustment reflects the need to adapt to the current conditions without risking a drastic decline in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.4% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help achieve a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 3.87, which is only 0.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to sustain itself. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we need to be cautious with our hunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still being mindful of the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 4.53, which is only 0.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to stabilize while still competing with other wolves. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a potential for overhunting. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to recover while ensuring our own sustainability in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 5.38, which is only 0.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain its health. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach, avoiding overhunting and ensuring sustainable coexistence."
