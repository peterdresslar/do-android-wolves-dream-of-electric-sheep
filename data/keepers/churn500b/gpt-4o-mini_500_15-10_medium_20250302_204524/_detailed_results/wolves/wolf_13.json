            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 29\n- Sheep population: 136.52\n- Wolf population: 8.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.633\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 17.07 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 13.7% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while preventing over-depletion of sheep. This balance will help maintain both populations in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 15.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with a relatively high sheep-to-wolf ratio of 6.87, I need to be cautious about overhunting. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, enabling sustainable coexistence while still allowing for some hunting to support the wolf population."
