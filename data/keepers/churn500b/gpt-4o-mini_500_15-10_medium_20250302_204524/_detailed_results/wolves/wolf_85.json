            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By focusing more on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help the sheep population stabilize while allowing the wolf population to adjust gradually. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. This indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover rather than intensifying hunting. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both species while preventing overexploitation of the sheep."
