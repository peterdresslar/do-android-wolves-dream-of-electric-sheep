            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 15.62, which is only 1.6% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting. This lower theta will help balance the populations and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta value of 0.30 will help balance the need for wolf survival while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their extinction. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and my previous theta was focused on competition rather than hunting. By increasing theta slightly to 0.30, I can begin to balance hunting with the need to allow the sheep population to recover while still being mindful of the growing wolf population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance."
