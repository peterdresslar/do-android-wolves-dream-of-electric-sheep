            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term survival for both.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are more sheep available per wolf. This suggests that I should focus on allowing the sheep population to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support the wolf population. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach that balances competition with other wolves and sustainable hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.4% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. This will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem."
