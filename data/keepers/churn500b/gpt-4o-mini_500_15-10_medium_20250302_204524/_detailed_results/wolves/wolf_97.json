            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.65, which is only 2.7% of its maximum capacity. While my previous theta of 0.864 indicates a strong hunting intensity, I need to reduce it slightly to allow the sheep population to recover. A theta of 0.75 represents a moderate hunting intensity that balances my need to sustain the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can allow the sheep to replenish while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep population a chance to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and prioritizes long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.3% of its maximum capacity, and my previous theta was too high for the current conditions. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep population to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. This gradual adjustment will help ensure long-term survival for both species."
