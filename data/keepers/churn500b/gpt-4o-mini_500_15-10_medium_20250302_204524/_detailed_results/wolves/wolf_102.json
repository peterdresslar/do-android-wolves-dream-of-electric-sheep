            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. Focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to recover, ensuring a sustainable future for both species. A gradual approach is necessary to avoid sudden population crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their depletion. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.20 to 0.25, I can still focus on competition with other wolves while allowing the sheep population a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.3% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. Focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to recover while preventing overhunting, ensuring long-term survival for both species. A gradual adjustment is necessary to maintain balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.3% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover while preventing overcompetition among wolves. This balance is crucial for the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution in hunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 3.59, which is only 0.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover, and focusing on competition with other wolves will allow for a more sustainable balance. By keeping the hunting intensity low, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 3.87, which is only 0.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.30 to 0.35, I can still focus on competition with other wolves while allowing for some sustainable hunting. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 4.19, which is only 0.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is an opportunity to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction while still allowing for some recovery of the sheep population. A gradual increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, ensuring we do not deplete the sheep further while also considering the current wolf population."
