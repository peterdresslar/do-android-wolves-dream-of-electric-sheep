            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.2% of maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite high at 3.45. This suggests that while there is an opportunity to hunt, it is crucial to maintain a balance to allow the sheep population to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.26 to 0.30, I can focus on a more sustainable approach that supports both the wolf and sheep populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.6% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term survival of both species. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance as the sheep population recovers, while also considering the growth of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 45.53, which is only 4.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover, and focusing more on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to stabilize and grow. A lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both species by preventing overhunting."
