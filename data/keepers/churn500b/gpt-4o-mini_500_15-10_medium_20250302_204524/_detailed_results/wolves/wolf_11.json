This adjustment will help sustain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover gradually. A balanced approach is essential to ensure long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual approach is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",

This value balances the need for wolf reproduction while ensuring that the sheep can recover. It also reflects the current dynamics of the ecosystem, allowing for sustainable coexistence."
