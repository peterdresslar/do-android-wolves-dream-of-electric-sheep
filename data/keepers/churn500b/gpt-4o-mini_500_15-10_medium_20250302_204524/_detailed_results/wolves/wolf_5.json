            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.77, which is only 1.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing our own population. A moderate theta of 0.40 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack without depleting the sheep further, promoting a healthier balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.61, which is only 1.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting a lower theta, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize while also ensuring that our own numbers do not decline too rapidly. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.69, which is only 1.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain our wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for our pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 1.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution in hunting. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.4 to 0.35, I can still focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
