            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low at 0.08. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. A theta of 0.35 strikes a balance between competing with other wolves and allowing the sheep to regain their numbers, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. This lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population, which is essential for the sustainability of our pack."
