            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at only 2.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that they need time to recover. A lower theta allows for competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to increase their numbers. This approach supports long-term sustainability and prevents overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.36, which is only 2.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.19, which is only 2.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.4 to 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.18, which is only 2.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is an opportunity to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A small increase to 0.40 maintains a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 29.42, which is only 2.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring that both populations can stabilize and thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.91, which is only 3.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is an opportunity to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A gradual increase to 0.40 strikes a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.54, which is only 3.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that the sheep need time to recover, and a lower hunting intensity will allow for their population to stabilize. Additionally, with a wolf population of 4.00, maintaining a moderate focus on competition among wolves is essential to ensure our numbers do not decline too rapidly. A gradual adjustment will help us find a sustainable balance.",

A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 40.70, which is only 4.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover rather than intensifying our hunting. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the balance needed for both populations to thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 44.27, which is only 4.4% of its maximum capacity. While I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. A slight increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 14.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, the wolf population is relatively small, and I need to ensure that we do not overhunt and deplete the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that supports both sheep recovery and wolf population health.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity and promote a sustainable balance, while still allowing for some competition among wolves as our numbers are relatively stable.",
