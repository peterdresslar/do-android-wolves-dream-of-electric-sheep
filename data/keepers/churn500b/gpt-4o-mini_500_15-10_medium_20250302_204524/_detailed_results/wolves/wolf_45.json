            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.50, which is only 0.9% of its maximum capacity. While I need to maintain a balance to ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I can afford to increase my hunting intensity slightly to take advantage of the low sheep numbers. However, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly, so a moderate theta of 0.6 allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep to replenish while ensuring the wolf population remains stable. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem."
