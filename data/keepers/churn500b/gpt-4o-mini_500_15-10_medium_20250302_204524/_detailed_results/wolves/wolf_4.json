            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.61, which is only 1.7% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.40 strikes a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.83, which is only 1.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are recovering, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to increase their numbers while also reducing competition among wolves. A gradual approach is necessary to ensure sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that supports both populations without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively low at 21.70, which is only 2.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. This will help balance the ecosystem and prevent over-depletion of the sheep population."
