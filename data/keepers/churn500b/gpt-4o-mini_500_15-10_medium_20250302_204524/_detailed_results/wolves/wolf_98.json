            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. This lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population, which is essential for the future of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to repopulate while also reducing competition among wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help the sheep population stabilize while allowing our own numbers to adjust gradually. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.3% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a significant scarcity of prey. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also reducing competition among wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.3% of its maximum capacity, and my previous theta was already low. To allow the sheep to recover, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting. This will help stabilize the ecosystem and ensure that both populations can thrive in the long run."
