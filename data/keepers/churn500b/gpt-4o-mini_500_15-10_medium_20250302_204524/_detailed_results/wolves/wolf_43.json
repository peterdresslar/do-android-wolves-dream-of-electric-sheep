            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.65, which is only 2.7% of its maximum capacity. While I need to maintain hunting to support the wolf population, I must also be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A moderate increase in hunting intensity allows for some reproduction among wolves while still giving sheep a chance to recover."
