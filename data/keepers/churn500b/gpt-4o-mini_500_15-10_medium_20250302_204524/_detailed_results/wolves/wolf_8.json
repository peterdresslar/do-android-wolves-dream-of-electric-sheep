A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.70, which is only 2.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while prioritizing competition with other wolves to ensure a sustainable balance.",
