            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves, which means competition for food is increasing. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of securing a meal while still being cautious not to overexert myself in a potentially competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and with the recent increase in wolves, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and risk my survival. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 8 wolves competing for food, a moderate increase in hunting intensity will allow me to secure enough resources without overexerting myself. This balance helps ensure my survival while still being mindful of the competition.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in both sheep and wolves suggests a competitive environment. By raising my hunting intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the abundant sheep while still being cautious of the increased wolf population. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, indicating a good opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively when necessary. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a crowded environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can take advantage of the sheep population while still being cautious about overexerting myself, given the recent increase in wolves. This balance helps ensure my survival while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can maximize my chances of securing enough food while still being mindful of the sheep population. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy while still allowing me to hunt effectively. This balance increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the number of wolves suggests a more competitive environment for hunting. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can better secure food while still conserving energy for future hunts, balancing the need for survival with the risk of overexertion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential failure. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid direct competition while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",

This balance helps ensure my survival in a changing environment.",

            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making it more challenging to find food. With an increase in the wolf population, competition for prey is higher. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the hunt when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting at full intensity less sustainable. With more wolves and fewer sheep, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion, while also considering that other wolves are competing for the same resources. This moderate approach helps ensure my survival without exhausting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting may not be as fruitful as before. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competing directly with other wolves who are hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and increase my chances of survival.",

A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and wait for a more favorable situation while still being able to hunt effectively if needed.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity may lead to competition with other wolves for limited resources. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the wolf population is also declining. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who may be hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey while still ensuring my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment.
