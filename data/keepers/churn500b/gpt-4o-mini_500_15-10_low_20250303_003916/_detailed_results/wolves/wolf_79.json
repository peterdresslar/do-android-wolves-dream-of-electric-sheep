            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity reduces the risk of competition and allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the wolf population is increasing. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still contributing to the hunt when necessary. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, which presents a better opportunity for hunting. However, with the number of wolves remaining constant, I need to be cautious not to overexert myself and risk depleting resources too quickly. A moderate increase in intensity allows me to take advantage of the situation while still conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at a higher intensity will increase my chances of securing a meal, but I also need to be cautious not to overexert myself and risk injury or exhaustion. A theta of 0.60 strikes a balance between being competitive and conserving energy.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating that hunting may be less successful. By reducing my intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, allowing me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the wolf population has increased. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves for limited prey. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means hunting might be less successful if I go all out. By increasing my intensity slightly from my previous 0.30, I can balance the need for food while conserving energy and avoiding overexertion, especially since the number of wolves remains unchanged.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly to 0.50, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy. This balance is crucial as the wolf population is increasing, leading to more competition for food.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased slightly, indicating that hunting may be less fruitful if I go all out. By increasing my intensity from 0.50 to 0.70, I can balance the need to hunt effectively while still conserving energy and avoiding overexertion, especially since the number of wolves remains the same.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity may lead to competition and less food for everyone. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population decreasing, I need to increase my hunting intensity slightly to ensure I can secure enough food for survival. However, I also want to avoid overexerting myself, as the wolf population remains stable, and competition for food could increase if other wolves also adjust their hunting strategies.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and reduce competition for the remaining sheep. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of catching enough food while still conserving energy, as the competition with other wolves remains constant.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can maximize my chances of catching enough prey while still being mindful of the competition with other wolves. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating less food availability.
