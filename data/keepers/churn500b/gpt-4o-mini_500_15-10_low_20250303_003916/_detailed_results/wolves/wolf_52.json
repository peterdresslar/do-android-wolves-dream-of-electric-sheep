            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the wolf population, which means there is enough food available. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.40, I can take advantage of the current situation without overexerting myself, allowing for a sustainable approach to hunting while still being cautious of the increasing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and conflict. By increasing my intensity slightly to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while being cautious about overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the wolf population has increased. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, ensuring my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, making competition for food more intense. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still being effective in securing food. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a potentially competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, which means food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with increasing wolf numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With an increase in the wolf population, competition for food will be higher. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, and the number of wolves is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves for the dwindling sheep. This strategy allows me to survive longer while waiting for a more favorable hunting situation.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment with more wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 28 wolves, the competition for food is significant. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while conserving energy for future hunts, ensuring my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, and the number of wolves is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves for the limited sheep. This strategy allows me to survive longer while waiting for a better opportunity.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating less food availability. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly from my previous theta of 0.30 to 0.45, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity, I can better secure my share of the dwindling sheep population while still conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making them a scarcer resource. With more wolves around, I need to increase my hunting intensity to ensure I can secure enough food for survival. A theta of 0.60 strikes a balance between being aggressive enough to catch prey while not exhausting myself too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can maximize my chances of securing enough food while still being cautious, as the wolf population remains stable. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, indicating a scarcity of food. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt if necessary. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current environment and ensure my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the competition among wolves is high. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can maximize my chances of securing food while still being cautious about overexerting myself in a dwindling environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the competition among wolves is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and with fewer sheep, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves for limited resources. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the wolf population is still high. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy and avoiding competition with other wolves. A moderate approach allows me to adapt to the changing environment without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the number of wolves, and hunting at a lower intensity will help conserve energy while still allowing for a chance to catch prey. This approach minimizes the risk of competition with other wolves and helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while conserving energy, as the sheep population is still relatively high. This approach allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself, which is crucial for my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a more cautious approach. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who may be hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a declining wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolf populations indicates a competitive environment.
