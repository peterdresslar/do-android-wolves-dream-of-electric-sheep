            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and less food for me. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population decreasing and the number of wolves remaining the same, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to balance the risk of overexertion with the need to secure food. This way, I can still contribute to the pack's survival while conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting may be more challenging. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can maximize my chances of securing food while still conserving energy, as the overall wolf population remains stable. This balance is crucial for my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting may be less successful. By lowering my intensity slightly, I can conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, allowing me to adapt to the current situation without risking too much energy on a potentially unsuccessful hunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can maximize my chances of catching enough prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the population of sheep has decreased, and the number of wolves is still high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively when necessary. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the number of wolves, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to overexertion and competition with other wolves. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt, increasing my chances of survival in a dwindling population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition is fierce.
