With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. This strategy increases my chances of survival by avoiding competition with other wolves for limited resources.",

A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting might be less fruitful. By adjusting my intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, balancing the need for food with the risk of overexertion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making food scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with increasing wolf numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting more challenging.

By reducing my hunting intensity, I can increase my chances of survival while waiting for a better opportunity.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, with the recent decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I don",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and hunting at a lower intensity will help conserve energy while still allowing for a successful hunt. Given the recent decrease in both sheep and wolves, a more cautious approach will help ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
