            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.6, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because with a stable number of wolves and a growing sheep population, I need to balance the need for food with the risk of overexerting myself. A theta of 0.75 allows me to hunt effectively while conserving energy for future hunts, ensuring my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, which means there is enough food available. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to ensure my survival while still contributing to the pack's success.",

This balance helps ensure my survival while still allowing me to contribute to the pack.",

This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and ensures my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves, which means there is enough food to sustain a more aggressive hunting strategy. Increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75 allows me to take advantage of the current situation while still being cautious, as the wolf population is increasing and competition for food is likely to rise.",
            "I chose this theta because with an increasing number of wolves, competition for food is intensifying. By lowering my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding.

By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still contributing to the hunt when necessary. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
