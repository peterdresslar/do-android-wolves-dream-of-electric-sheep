This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, which means there is enough food available. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly to 0.50, I can take advantage of the situation without overexerting myself, ensuring I have energy for future hunts while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the number of wolves. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and reduce competition with other wolves, while still allowing for a sustainable approach to hunting. This strategy increases my chances of survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and with 19 wolves competing for food, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still increasing my chances of a successful hunt. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means food is becoming scarcer. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.40, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still participating in hunts.

This balanced approach allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself, ensuring my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population increasing and the number of wolves remaining constant, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to balance the need for food while avoiding overexertion. This way, I can conserve energy and still compete effectively with other wolves.",
