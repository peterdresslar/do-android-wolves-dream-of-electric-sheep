By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy while still participating in hunts, allowing me to adapt to the current situation and increase my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can maximize my chances of catching enough prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a competitive environment. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's survival. This balanced approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the declining wolf population."
