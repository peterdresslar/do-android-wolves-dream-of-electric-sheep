            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting may be more challenging. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can maximize my chances of catching enough food while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with more wolves around, competition for food will be fierce. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's efforts. This balance will help ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population decreasing and the number of wolves remaining constant, it's important to balance my hunting intensity. By reducing my theta to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, allowing me to adapt to the changing environment and avoid overexertion in a potentially competitive situation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, and the number of wolves has increased.
