This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself, especially as competition among wolves may rise.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the decreased number of wolves. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if needed. This cautious approach increases my chances of survival in a fluctuating environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. With fewer wolves around, a moderate intensity allows me to secure food while conserving energy for future hunts, ensuring my survival in a fluctuating environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 8 wolves competing for food, hunting at a lower intensity will help conserve energy and reduce the risk of overexertion. This strategy allows me to remain competitive while ensuring my survival in a stable environment.",
