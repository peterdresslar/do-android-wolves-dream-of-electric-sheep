By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts, especially with the rising number of wolves competing for food.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and I want to balance the need for food with the risk of overexerting myself. By increasing my intensity slightly from my previous theta, I can take advantage of the current sheep numbers while still conserving energy for future hunts.",

            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a more cautious approach. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, who may be hunting at maximum intensity.
