            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting. By increasing my intensity to 0.75, I can take advantage of the higher availability of prey while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself, especially since the number of wolves remains constant.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a more cautious approach. By reducing my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still taking advantage of the available prey.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, indicating more food availability. However, with the number of wolves remaining constant, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can secure enough food without overexerting myself. A theta of 0.75 allows me to hunt effectively while conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, which means there is more food available. However, with the number of wolves remaining the same, I want to avoid overexerting myself and risking injury or exhaustion. A slightly lower intensity allows me to hunt efficiently while conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 11 wolves competing for food, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective. This way, I can avoid overexertion and increase my chances of survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, with the number of wolves remaining the same, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still compete effectively without exhausting myself or risking injury. A theta of 0.65 allows me to take advantage of the increased prey while still being cautious.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and I want to increase my chances of a successful hunt without overexerting myself. By adjusting my intensity to 0.75, I can balance the need for food with the risk of depleting resources too quickly, ensuring my survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival in a crowded environment.",
