            "I chose this theta because with the increase in the wolf population, competition for food is likely to intensify. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival in a growing pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased slightly, indicating a potential scarcity of food. However, the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for the remaining sheep. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I aim to maximize my chances of catching prey while still conserving some energy for future hunts, balancing the need for food with the risk of overexertion.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the stable wolf population. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still taking advantage of the available prey. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a fluctuating environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making food scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with increasing wolf numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the wolf population is increasing. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves for limited prey. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, which presents a good opportunity for hunting. However, with the wolf population remaining the same, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I don't exhaust myself or attract too much attention from other wolves. A moderate intensity of 0.50 allows me to take advantage of the situation while still conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and less food for myself. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and wait for a better opportunity to hunt when the conditions are more favorable.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased slightly, indicating a potential scarcity of food.
