            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival in a more competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the number of sheep increasing and the wolf population remaining stable, a slightly higher hunting intensity can help me secure enough food while still being cautious. This balance allows me to take advantage of the current situation without overexerting myself, ensuring my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival in a growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of catching enough prey while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 15 wolves, there is enough competition. A slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This balance increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival in a crowded environment.",
