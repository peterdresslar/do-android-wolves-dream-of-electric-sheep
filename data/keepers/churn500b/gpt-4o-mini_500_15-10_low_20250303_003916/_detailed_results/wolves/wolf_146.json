By increasing my intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the sheep population while still conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively stable, and with 19 wolves competing for food, a moderate hunting intensity will help me conserve energy while still allowing for a reasonable chance of catching prey. This balance reduces the risk of overexertion and ensures my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means food is becoming scarcer. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are likely to hunt at maximum intensity. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased slightly, which means there is a bit more food available. However, with the number of wolves remaining the same, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough prey while avoiding overexertion. A theta of 0.60 allows me to be more efficient in my hunting without risking too much energy.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating that hunting may be less fruitful if I maintain a high intensity.
