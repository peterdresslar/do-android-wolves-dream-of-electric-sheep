By reducing my intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, especially since the number of wolves has remained stable. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",

However, with fewer wolves around, I need to balance my intensity to ensure I can catch enough food while also conserving energy and avoiding overexertion.
