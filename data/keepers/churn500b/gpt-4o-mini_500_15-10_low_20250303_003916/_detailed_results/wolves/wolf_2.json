            "I chose this theta because with a stable number of sheep and wolves, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to balance the need for food while minimizing the risk of overexertion and competition with other wolves. This way, I can still secure enough resources without drawing too much attention.",
            "I chose this theta because with the number of sheep increasing and the wolf population stable, a slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the decrease in the wolf population, I need to be more aggressive in hunting to secure enough food for survival. The sheep population has increased slightly, which presents an opportunity, but I must balance the risk of overexertion with the need to ensure I can eat enough. A theta of 0.75 allows me to hunt effectively while still conserving some energy.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. With fewer wolves around, a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive. This balance helps ensure my survival in a changing environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 8 wolves competing for food, hunting at a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being able to catch prey. This strategy helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment."
