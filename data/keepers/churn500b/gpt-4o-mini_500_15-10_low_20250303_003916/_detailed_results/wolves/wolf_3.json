            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep remains stable, and with 10 wolves competing for the same prey, a moderate increase in hunting intensity will help me secure enough food while avoiding overexertion. This balance allows me to conserve energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased slightly, indicating a potential for more food. However, with the number of wolves remaining constant, I need to balance my hunting intensity to avoid overexertion and ensure I have enough energy for future hunts. A moderate intensity allows me to be efficient while still conserving energy.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting. However, with the decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still compete with others while also conserving energy for future hunts. A theta of 0.70 allows me to be aggressive enough to secure food without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, but the wolf population has decreased. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt, ensuring I have enough strength for future challenges. This balanced approach helps me adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because with 17.38 sheep and 8 wolves, the competition for food is high. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.40, I can conserve energy and avoid overexerting myself, while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough prey while avoiding overexertion. By increasing my intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the current sheep population without risking too much energy, which is crucial for my survival."
