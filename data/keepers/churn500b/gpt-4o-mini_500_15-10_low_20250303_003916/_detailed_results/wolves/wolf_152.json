            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By lowering my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 14 wolves competing for food, a slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This strategy balances the need for food with the risk of overexertion, ensuring my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased significantly, which means competition for food is higher. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population increasing and the number of wolves remaining stable, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to balance the need for food while avoiding overexertion. This way, I can still compete effectively with other wolves without risking my energy reserves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy and avoid competition for limited resources. This way, I can still hunt effectively without overexerting myself."
