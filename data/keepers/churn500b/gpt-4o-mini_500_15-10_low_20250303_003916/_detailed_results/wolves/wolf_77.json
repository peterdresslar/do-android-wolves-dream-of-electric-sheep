            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and less chance of securing a meal. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and wait for better opportunities.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and with the wolf population remaining the same, competition for food will be higher. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, balancing the need for survival with the current scarcity of prey.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating less food availability. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt if necessary. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting may be more challenging. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of securing food while still conserving energy, as the overall wolf population remains stable.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my intensity to 0.75, I can improve my chances of successfully hunting while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive situation with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the wolf population is also declining. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and increase my chances of survival while still contributing to the pack"
