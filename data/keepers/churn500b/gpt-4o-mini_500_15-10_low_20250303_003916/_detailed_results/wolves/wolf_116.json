            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting might be less rewarding. By increasing my intensity slightly, I can maximize my chances of a successful hunt while still conserving energy for future needs. This balance helps ensure my survival in a changing environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at full intensity could lead to competition and less food for me. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means hunting intensity needs to be higher to ensure I can catch enough food. However, I also want to avoid overexerting myself since the wolf population has remained stable, indicating competition for resources. A theta of 0.75 balances the need for food with the risk of exhausting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, which means hunting might be less successful if I go all out. By lowering my intensity to 0.6, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt, allowing me to adapt to the current situation and ensure my survival without competing too aggressively with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, which means food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can maximize my chances of catching enough prey while still conserving energy, as the competition with other wolves remains constant.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This approach allows me to adapt to the current situation and increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, and with 21 wolves competing for food, hunting at full intensity may lead to overexploitation of the remaining sheep. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt, ensuring my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still being mindful of the competition from other wolves. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can maximize my chances of catching enough food while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy while still being active enough to catch prey when opportunities arise. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity, I can improve my chances of securing enough food for survival while still being mindful of the competition from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the competition among wolves is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, but the wolf population has decreased significantly. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still taking advantage of the available prey. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment."
