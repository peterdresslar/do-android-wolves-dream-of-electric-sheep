With more wolves around, I need to increase my hunting intensity to compete effectively for the limited resources.

This balanced approach increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",

By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.6, I can conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, allowing me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
