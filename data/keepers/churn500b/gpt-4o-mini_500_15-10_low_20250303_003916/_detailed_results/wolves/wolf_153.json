            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population means competition for food is rising. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival in a more competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the number of sheep increasing and the wolf population stable, I can afford to hunt at a lower intensity. This allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in securing food. A lower theta also reduces the risk of overexertion and potential injury, which is crucial for my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the wolf population is increasing. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still contributing to the hunt. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment."
