            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy and avoid competition while still allowing for some hunting opportunities.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. However, the increase in the wolf population suggests competition is rising. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can better compete for food while still being mindful of the dwindling sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves in the area, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and failure. By reducing my intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still participating in hunts, allowing me to adapt to the changing environment and ensure my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and failure. A theta of 0.70 allows me to hunt effectively while conserving energy and avoiding overexertion in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and reduce competition for the remaining sheep. This balanced approach increases my chances of survival in the current environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and the number of wolves remains high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and increases my chances of survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, which means hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. By choosing a moderate intensity, I can still contribute to the pack's needs while ensuring I have enough energy for future hunts, especially as the sheep population stabilizes.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive pack.",

By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can better compete for food while still conserving some energy. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a situation where resources are limited.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the number of wolves, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves for the limited prey. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
