            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making food scarcer. With an increase in the wolf population, competition for food will be higher. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means food is becoming scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and adapt to the changing environment while still participating in hunts when opportunities arise.",
