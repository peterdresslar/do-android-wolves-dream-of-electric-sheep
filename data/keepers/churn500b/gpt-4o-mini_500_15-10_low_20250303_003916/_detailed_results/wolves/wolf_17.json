            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity, I can improve my chances of securing enough food while still being mindful of the sheep population, which is also increasing. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid competition while still contributing to the pack's survival. A moderate approach helps ensure I can hunt effectively without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and less food for me. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and wait for a better opportunity to hunt when the conditions improve.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the wolf population, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity. By adjusting my theta to 0.50, I can balance my energy expenditure while still contributing to the hunt, ensuring my survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By raising my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can increase my chances of catching enough prey while still conserving some energy. This balance is crucial for my survival in a growing pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at full intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making them more scarce. With an increase in the wolf population, competition for food is higher.

A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting at maximum intensity less viable. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid competition while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting more competitive. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can better compete with other wolves for the limited resources while still conserving some energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, which means hunting might be less rewarding. However, with the number of wolves remaining the same, I need to increase my hunting intensity to ensure I can secure enough food for survival. A theta of 0.75 balances the need for food while considering the current sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with the number of wolves remaining the same, hunting at full intensity may not be sustainable. A slightly reduced intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's needs, ensuring my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with the number of wolves remaining constant, hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and adapt to the changing environment while still contributing to the pack's survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the overall trend shows a decline in the wolf population. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can better compete for the limited resources while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the wolf population is also declining. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competing too aggressively with other wolves for the dwindling sheep. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",
