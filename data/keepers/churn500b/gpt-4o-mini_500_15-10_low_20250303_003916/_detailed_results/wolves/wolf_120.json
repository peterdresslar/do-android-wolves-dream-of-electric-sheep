            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, indicating more food availability. However, with the number of wolves remaining constant, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still secure enough food without overexerting myself. A moderate increase in theta allows me to take advantage of the higher sheep numbers while still being cautious.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, which presents a good opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition is high, and I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch prey while conserving energy and avoiding overexertion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased slightly, indicating a stable food source. However, with the number of wolves remaining the same, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I have enough energy for future hunts while still being competitive. A theta of 0.65 allows me to hunt effectively without overexerting myself."
