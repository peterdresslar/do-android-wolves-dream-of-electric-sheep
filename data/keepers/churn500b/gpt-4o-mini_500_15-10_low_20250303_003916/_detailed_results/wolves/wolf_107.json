            "I chose this theta because with the increase in the wolf population, competition for food is likely to intensify. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to hunt effectively while conserving energy and avoiding overexertion. This way, I can adapt to the changing dynamics and ensure my survival without risking too much in a potentially competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, which means there is enough food available. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can be more competitive without overexerting myself, ensuring I have a better chance of securing a meal while also conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased slightly, and the wolf population has increased. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and adapt to the current situation while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential failure.
