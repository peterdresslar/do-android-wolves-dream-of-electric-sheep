            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. With the increase in the wolf population, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and overexploitation of the remaining sheep. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, ensuring my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting may be less fruitful. By increasing my intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the remaining sheep while still conserving energy for future hunts, ensuring my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating that food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can improve my chances of catching enough prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting might be less fruitful. By lowering my intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, allowing me to adapt to the current situation and avoid overexertion.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my hunting intensity from 0.60 to 0.75, I can better compete for food while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging situation.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating that hunting may be less successful. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to catch enough prey to survive.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the wolf population is also declining. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also struggling. This strategy allows me to survive longer while waiting for conditions to improve.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low, and the wolf population has decreased significantly. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who may be hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and increase my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, which presents a better opportunity for hunting. However, the recent decrease in the wolf population suggests that I need to be cautious and not overexert myself.
