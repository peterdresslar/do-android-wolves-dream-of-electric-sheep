However, with the number of wolves remaining the same, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough prey without exhausting myself or risking competition with other wolves. A theta of 0.75 allows me to hunt effectively while conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased slightly, indicating a stable food source. With the number of wolves remaining the same, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive. This strategy balances the need for food with the risk of overexertion in a stable environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased slightly, but the number of wolves remains unchanged. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still contributing to the hunt. This balanced approach helps ensure my survival in a stable environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with 34 sheep and 13 wolves, the competition for food is moderate. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of securing a meal without overexerting myself, as the other wolves may also be hunting at maximum intensity. This balance allows me to be more strategic in my approach while still being effective.",
