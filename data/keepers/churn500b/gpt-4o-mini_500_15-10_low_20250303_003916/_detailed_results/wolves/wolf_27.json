With an increase in the wolf population, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential failure to catch prey. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. However, the wolf population has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still being cautious not to overexert myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and failure. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy and adapt to the changing environment while still contributing to the hunt.",

With more wolves around, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still increasing my chances of catching prey. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making them a scarcer resource. With an increase in the wolf population, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves and potential overexploitation of the remaining sheep. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and adapt to the changing environment while still contributing to the hunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can better compete with other wolves for the limited resources while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can maximize my chances of securing enough food while still being mindful of the competition with other wolves. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of securing enough food while still being mindful of the competition from other wolves. A balance between aggression and caution is necessary for survival.",

This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and avoid overexertion, which is crucial for my survival.",
