This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a dwindling resource scenario.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the wolf population is also declining. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to survive longer while waiting for a more favorable situation.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the competition among wolves is high. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of catching enough food while still being mindful of the dwindling sheep population. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the number of wolves, and hunting at a lower intensity will help conserve energy while still allowing for a chance to catch prey. This approach also reduces the risk of competition with other wolves, who may be hunting at maximum intensity.",

A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive in the hunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the wolf population, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves and potential overhunting. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid drawing attention while still contributing to the pack's survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased slightly, indicating a potential for more food. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition is fierce. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion and competition from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low, and the wolf population has decreased. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who may be hunting aggressively. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current environment while still ensuring I can secure food when necessary.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in the wolf population suggests that hunting at maximum intensity may lead to competition with other wolves for the same prey. By choosing a moderate intensity, I can still contribute to the hunt while conserving energy and reducing the risk of overexertion, ensuring my survival in a challenging environment.",
