By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.30, I can conserve energy and avoid overexerting myself while still contributing to the pack's overall success. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests that competition for food will be higher. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while conserving energy and avoiding overexertion. This way, I can adapt to the changing dynamics and ensure my survival without risking too much in a potentially competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, which presents a good opportunity for hunting. By increasing my intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the higher prey availability while still being cautious about overexerting myself. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
