A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and risk of failure. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting.",

            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with increasing wolf numbers.",

By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still participating in hunts. This balanced approach increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",

This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and ensure my own survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment.
