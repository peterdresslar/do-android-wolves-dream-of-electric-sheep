            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential failure. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and adapt to the changing environment while still contributing to the pack's survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure enough food while avoiding overexertion and competition with other wolves. This moderate approach helps ensure my survival without risking too much energy.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and while the wolf population has increased, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food without exhausting myself or competing too fiercely with other wolves. A slightly higher intensity than before allows me to adapt to the changing conditions while still being cautious.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, which means food is becoming scarcer. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and increase my chances of survival while still contributing to the pack's efforts. This balanced approach allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and avoid competition with others for the remaining sheep. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating that food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion, while still being mindful of the competition from other wolves. This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the changing environment and ensure my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, which means hunting may be less successful if I go all out. By increasing my intensity from 0.50 to 0.75, I can balance the need for food while still being cautious about the dwindling sheep numbers. This way, I can maximize my chances of a successful hunt without overexerting myself or risking failure.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This approach allows me to adapt to the current situation and increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my intensity from 0.60 to 0.75, I can maximize my chances of securing food while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival, especially with the wolf population remaining stable.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the competition among wolves is high.
