            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By increasing my hunting intensity, I can better secure my share of the dwindling sheep population while still being mindful of energy conservation.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, while the wolf population has increased. This suggests that competition for food is rising, and hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion, while still contributing to the pack's efforts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making them a scarcer resource. With more wolves around, I need to increase my hunting intensity to ensure I can secure enough food for survival. A theta of 0.60 balances the need for increased effort while still conserving some energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, indicating that hunting may be less rewarding. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This strategy balances my need for survival with the current scarcity of prey."
