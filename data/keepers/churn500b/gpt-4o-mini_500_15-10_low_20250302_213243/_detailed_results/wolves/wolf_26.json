            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting more challenging. With an increase in the wolf population, I need to be strategic and conserve energy while still participating in hunts. A moderate intensity allows me to balance my efforts and increase my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the overall population of wolves is also declining. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still conserving energy and avoiding overexertion. This approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of resources and increases my chances of survival without competing too aggressively with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is low and the competition among wolves is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid drawing attention to myself while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, which means hunting may become more competitive among wolves. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while conserving energy, as the overall wolf population is also declining. This strategy allows me to adapt to the changing environment and improve my chances of survival."
