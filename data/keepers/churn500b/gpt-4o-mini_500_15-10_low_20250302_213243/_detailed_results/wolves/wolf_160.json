            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting more challenging. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy and avoid competition while still allowing for a chance to catch prey. This balance increases my chances of survival in a tough environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can maximize my chances of securing enough food while still being mindful of the competition from other wolves. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.5, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the number of wolves, and hunting at a lower intensity will help conserve energy and reduce competition with other wolves. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and increase my chances of survival."
