            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting more challenging. With more wolves around, a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still increasing my chances of catching prey. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, which means hunting is becoming more competitive. Increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60 allows me to be more aggressive in securing food while still conserving energy for future hunts, given the rising wolf population. This balance is crucial for my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population decreasing, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food while not exhausting myself. A theta of 0.75 allows me to hunt effectively without overexerting, considering the competition from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves suggests a more competitive environment. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack"
