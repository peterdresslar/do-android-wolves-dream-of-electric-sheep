By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival as the wolf population increases.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means food is becoming scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential failure. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.5, I can conserve energy and still contribute to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the number of wolves, indicating competition for food is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment."
