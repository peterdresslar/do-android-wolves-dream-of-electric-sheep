            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the remaining sheep while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",

By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.5, I can balance the need for food while still conserving energy and reducing the risk of overexertion. This way, I can adapt to the current situation and ensure my survival without competing too aggressively with other wolves."
