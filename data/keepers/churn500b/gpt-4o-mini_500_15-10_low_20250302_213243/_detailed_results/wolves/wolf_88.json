            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid drawing attention to myself while still contributing to the pack's success. This strategy allows me to survive longer in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, which means competition for food is increasing. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the available prey while still conserving energy for future hunts, ensuring my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the wolf population has increased. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.25, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still being able to catch enough prey to survive. This cautious approach allows me to adapt to the changing environment and ensure my longevity.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the wolf population has increased. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the population of sheep has decreased, making hunting more competitive. With an increase in the number of wolves, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts. This strategy helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the number of wolves, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to overexertion and competition with other wolves. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid drawing attention while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low, and the wolf population has also decreased. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment."
