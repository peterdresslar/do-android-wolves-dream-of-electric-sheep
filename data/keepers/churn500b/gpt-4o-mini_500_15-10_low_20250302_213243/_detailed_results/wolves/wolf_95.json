            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the wolf population is also declining. A lower hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves for limited prey. By being strategic and not overexerting myself, I can increase my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still conserving energy. This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity without overexerting myself, which is crucial for my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and with more wolves around, competition for food is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the number of wolves, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves for limited prey. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct confrontation, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment."
