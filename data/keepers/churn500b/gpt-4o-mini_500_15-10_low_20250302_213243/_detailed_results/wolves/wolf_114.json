            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting may be more challenging. By increasing my intensity slightly from my previous theta of 0.52, I can improve my chances of a successful hunt while still conserving energy for future needs. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population decreasing, hunting at full intensity may not be sustainable. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's needs. This balance helps ensure my survival in a changing environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the population of sheep has decreased, indicating that food is becoming scarcer. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also struggling. This strategy allows me to survive longer in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, with the recent decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still survive while not overexerting myself. A moderate intensity allows me to contribute to the pack"
