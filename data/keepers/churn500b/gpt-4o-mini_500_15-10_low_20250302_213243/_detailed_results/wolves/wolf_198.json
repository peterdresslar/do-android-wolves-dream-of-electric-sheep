            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, while the wolf population has decreased. This suggests that there may be more opportunities for hunting without overexerting myself. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population increasing and the number of wolves remaining constant, a slightly higher hunting intensity will allow me to secure enough food while still being cautious. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, which means there is more food available. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition is fierce. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.45, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still taking advantage of the increased sheep population. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 12 wolves competing for food, a moderate intensity will help me conserve energy while still increasing my chances of a successful hunt. This way, I can adapt to the situation without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with fewer wolves around, I can afford to hunt at a lower intensity. This will help conserve energy and reduce the risk of injury while still allowing me to secure food. A lower hunting intensity also means I can avoid competing too aggressively with other wolves, who may be feeling the pressure of the recent decrease in their numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population increasing and the number of wolves remaining stable, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to balance the need for food while not overexerting myself. This way, I can ensure my survival without risking depletion of resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and with the recent decrease in wolf population, it may be wise to conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves. A lower hunting intensity allows me to maintain my strength while still contributing to the pack's survival."
