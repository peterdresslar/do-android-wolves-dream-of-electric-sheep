            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and reduce competition for the remaining sheep. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is increasing. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the wolf population is also declining. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.40, I can conserve energy and increase my chances of survival while still participating in the hunt. This approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and avoid overexertion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is increasing, which presents a good opportunity for hunting. However, the recent decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition is fierce. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can take advantage of the available prey while still being cautious about the risks of overexertion and potential failure.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests competition is fierce, so I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch prey while conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, which means there is more food available. However, with the number of wolves remaining the same, I can afford to hunt at a slightly lower intensity to conserve energy and reduce competition with other wolves. This balance helps ensure my survival while still allowing for successful hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because with the number of sheep increasing and the wolf population stable, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself, especially since other wolves are also competing for the same resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the decreased number of wolves. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still contributing to the pack's success. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with 25.76 sheep and 9 wolves, the competition for food is moderate. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while conserving energy. This approach allows me to remain competitive without overexerting myself, especially since other wolves are also hunting at maximum intensity."
