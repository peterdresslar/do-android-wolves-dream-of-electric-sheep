            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 12 wolves competing for food, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still increasing my chances of a successful hunt. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, I need to increase my hunting intensity to ensure I can catch enough food for survival. A theta of 0.60 strikes a balance between conserving energy and increasing my chances of a successful hunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and less food for me. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition while still contributing to the pack's success.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, which means hunting might be less rewarding. By increasing my intensity slightly to 0.60, I can take advantage of the remaining sheep while still conserving energy in case the situation worsens. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively low, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to overexploitation of the resource. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and ensure my survival while still contributing to the pack's overall success. This cautious approach allows me to adapt to the current situation where both sheep and wolves are decreasing.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the available prey while still being cautious. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a dwindling population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests competition is still present. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can take advantage of the available prey while still being cautious of the other wolves."
