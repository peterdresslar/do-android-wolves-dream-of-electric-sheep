            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and with the recent increase in both sheep and wolves, a moderate hunting intensity will help ensure I can still secure food without overexerting myself or risking competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, which means competition for food is increasing. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.65, I can improve my chances of securing food while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, which means there is enough food to sustain a moderate hunting intensity. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly from my previous theta, I can take advantage of the current sheep population while still being cautious, as the increase in wolves suggests competition for food is rising.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population means more competition for the available sheep. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and avoid drawing attention while still contributing to the hunt. This strategy allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics and ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the increase in the wolf population means competition for food is higher. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of securing food while still conserving energy, as the sheep population is not too high. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself."
