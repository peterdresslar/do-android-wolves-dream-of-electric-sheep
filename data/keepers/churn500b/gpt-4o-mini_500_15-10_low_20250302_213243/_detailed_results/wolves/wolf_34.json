By lowering my intensity to 0.25, I can conserve energy while still participating in hunts, allowing me to adapt to the changing environment and avoid overexertion as the competition among wolves increases.",

By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.5, I can balance the need for food while also conserving energy. This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the declining wolf population, ensuring my survival without overexerting myself.",
