By increasing my theta slightly from 0.40 to 0.50, I can balance the need to hunt effectively while also conserving energy and avoiding overexertion, especially with the recent increase in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because with an increase in the wolf population, competition for food is rising. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can better secure food while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a growing pack.",

By reducing my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still contributing to the hunt.
