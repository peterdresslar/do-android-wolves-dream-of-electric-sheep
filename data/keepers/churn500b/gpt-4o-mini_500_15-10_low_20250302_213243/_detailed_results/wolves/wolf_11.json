            "I chose this theta because the increase in both sheep and wolves suggests a competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can take advantage of the plentiful sheep while still conserving some energy for future hunts, balancing the need for survival with the risk of overexertion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the number of wolves. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can take advantage of the abundance of prey while still being cautious about overhunting, which could lead to competition with other wolves. This balance helps ensure my survival and the sustainability of the food source.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
