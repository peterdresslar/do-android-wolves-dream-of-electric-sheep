            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a more cautious approach. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.40, I can still contribute to the pack's success while minimizing the risk of overexertion and competition with other wolves. This balance helps ensure my survival in a growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can still hunt effectively while conserving energy and reducing the risk of overexertion. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. However, the increase in wolves suggests competition is rising. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can better compete for the limited resources while still conserving some energy for future hunts."
