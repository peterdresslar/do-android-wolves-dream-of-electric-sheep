            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the wolf population has increased. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can take advantage of the current situation while still being cautious. This balance allows me to secure food without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with the number of wolves remaining the same, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to overexploitation of the remaining sheep. A lower intensity allows for a more sustainable approach, ensuring I can survive while also considering the future availability of prey.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the competition among wolves is high with their population also declining. A lower hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment."
