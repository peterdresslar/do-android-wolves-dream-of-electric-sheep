            "I chose this theta because with 15 sheep and 10 wolves, the competition for food is significant. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests competition is high, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to overexertion or conflict with other wolves. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in securing food.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 8 wolves competing for them, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to overexertion and potential failure. By lowering my intensity to 0.40, I can conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, allowing me to adapt to the competition and ensure my survival."
