            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making them a more valuable resource. With the increase in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough prey without overexerting myself. A theta of 0.75 allows me to hunt effectively while conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.5, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, but the wolf population has decreased significantly. A lower hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still taking advantage of the available prey. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests competition is fierce. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, balancing the need for food with the risk of overexertion.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests competition is less intense, allowing me to hunt with a higher intensity without risking overexertion. This balance helps ensure my survival while still being mindful of the overall situation.",
