            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting more challenging. With more wolves around, I need to balance my energy expenditure with the likelihood of a successful hunt. A slightly increased intensity will help me compete better without overexerting myself, considering the recent increase in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because with 28.16 sheep and 10 wolves, the competition is high. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a potentially scarce environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. By increasing my intensity to 0.75, I can take advantage of the higher availability of prey while still conserving some energy for future hunts, ensuring my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with 35.44 sheep and 9 wolves, the competition for food is significant. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and increases my chances of survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can capitalize on the larger prey availability while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population increasing and the number of wolves remaining stable, a slightly lower hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a potentially competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with 41.31 sheep and 10 wolves, the competition for food is significant. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can improve my chances of catching prey without overexerting myself, as the sheep population is still relatively high. This balance allows me to be more strategic in my hunting while still being mindful of the other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, which means competition for food is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and avoid overexerting myself while still contributing to the hunt. This strategy allows me to adapt to the rising wolf population and ensure my survival without risking depletion of resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in both sheep and wolves suggests a competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can take advantage of the available prey while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still taking advantage of the available prey. This strategy increases my chances of survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, which means there is enough food available. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively when needed.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the current abundance of prey while still being cautious. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself, especially since other wolves are also hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, which means hunting at maximum intensity may not be necessary and could lead to overexertion. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's efforts. This approach balances my survival with the current prey availability."
