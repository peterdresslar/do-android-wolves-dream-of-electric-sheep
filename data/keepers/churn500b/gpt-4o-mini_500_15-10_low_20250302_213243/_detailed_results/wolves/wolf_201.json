            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, which means hunting is becoming more competitive. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while conserving energy for future hunts, as the wolf population is rising.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the wolf population, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves for the same prey. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that balances my need for food with the risk of overexertion. By hunting at 0.50, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's survival, especially given the recent decline in both sheep and wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, but the wolf population has decreased. This suggests that competition for food is less intense, allowing me to hunt with lower intensity while still ensuring I can secure enough food for survival. A lower theta also conserves energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. With fewer wolves around, a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive in securing food.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting. However, with the recent decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food while conserving energy for survival. A theta of 0.70 allows me to be more efficient without overexerting myself."
