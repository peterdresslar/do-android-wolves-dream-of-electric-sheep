            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By lowering my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",

By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival in a growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By increasing my hunting intensity, I can secure enough food for myself while still being mindful of the decreasing sheep population. A balance is needed to ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, it",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, indicating a scarcity of food. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment."
