By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the remaining sheep while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves for limited resources. By increasing my intensity slightly, I can still contribute to my survival while avoiding overexertion and potential conflict with pack members.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the wolf population is also declining. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while being cautious not to overexert myself in a competitive environment. This way, I can still contribute to the pack's survival without risking my own energy too much.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is low, and the wolf population has decreased significantly. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the decreased number of wolves. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can still contribute to the pack's success while conserving energy and reducing the risk of overexertion in a competitive environment."
