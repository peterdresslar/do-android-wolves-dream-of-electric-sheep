With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential failure. A slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and adapt to the changing environment while still contributing to the hunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a more competitive environment. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in a resource-scarce situation.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests competition is still present. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can take advantage of the sheep while still being cautious about the remaining wolves."
