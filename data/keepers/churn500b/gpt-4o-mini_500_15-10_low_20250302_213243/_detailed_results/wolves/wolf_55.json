            "I chose this theta because with an increasing number of wolves, competition for food is rising. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure enough food while conserving energy and avoiding overexertion. This way, I can adapt to the changing dynamics and ensure my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, I need to increase my hunting intensity to compete effectively for the limited resources. A theta of 0.70 allows me to balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making it less viable to hunt at maximum intensity. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to catch enough food to survive.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with the wolf population remaining the same, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to overexertion and potential failure. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is increasing. By adjusting my hunting intensity to a moderate level, I can conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This balance allows me to adapt to the current situation and increase my chances of survival without overexerting myself."
