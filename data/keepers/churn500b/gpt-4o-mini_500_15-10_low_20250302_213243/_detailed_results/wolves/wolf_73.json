A theta of 0.75 balances the need for increased effort while still conserving some energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is increasing. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's efforts. This balanced approach helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, which means there is more food available. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition is lower. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still taking advantage of the increased prey without overexerting myself in a potentially risky situation."
