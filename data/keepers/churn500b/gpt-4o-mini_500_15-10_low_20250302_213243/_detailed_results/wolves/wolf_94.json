This balance helps ensure that I can hunt effectively without overexerting myself, especially given the recent decline in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also struggling. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey while still being able to hunt effectively when conditions improve."
