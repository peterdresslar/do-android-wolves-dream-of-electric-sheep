            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can maximize my chances of catching enough food while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival, especially with the number of wolves remaining constant.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the competition among wolves is high due to their recent decline. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively. This balance increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the competition among wolves is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the number of wolves, and hunting at a lower intensity may help me conserve energy while still allowing for a successful hunt. This cautious approach also considers the recent decrease in both sheep and wolves, indicating a need for survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the number of wolves, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves. By choosing a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still increasing my chances of a successful hunt without overexerting myself or risking failure.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, with the number of wolves remaining the same, I need to be cautious and not overexert myself. A slightly higher intensity than before allows me to take advantage of the increased prey while still being mindful of competition.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, but the wolf population has decreased. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and increase my chances of survival while still being able to hunt effectively when necessary.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing more opportunities for hunting. However, with the recent decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure my survival while still being effective in securing food. A theta of 0.60 allows me to hunt efficiently without overexerting myself, considering the competition from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and with the recent decrease in wolf population, it's wise to conserve energy and avoid competition. A lower hunting intensity allows me to be strategic and wait for better opportunities while still contributing to the pack's survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, with the recent decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food while also conserving energy and avoiding overexertion.
