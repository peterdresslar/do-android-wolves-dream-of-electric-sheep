By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a potentially scarce environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy while still allowing for opportunistic hunting. This strategy balances my need for food with the risk of competition.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's survival. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the declining wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still conserving energy, as hunting at maximum intensity may lead to overexertion and risk of injury. This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity while still being effective.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the wolf population is also declining. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who may be hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to survive longer in a challenging environment."
