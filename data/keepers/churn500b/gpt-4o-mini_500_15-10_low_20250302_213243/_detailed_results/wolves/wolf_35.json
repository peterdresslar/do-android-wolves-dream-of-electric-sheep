            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to overexploitation of the remaining prey. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and increase my chances of survival while still contributing to the pack's needs. This approach allows me to adapt to the current situation and avoid competition with other wolves who may be hunting at full intensity.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, and with fewer wolves, I can afford to hunt with moderate intensity. This balance allows me to secure food while minimizing the risk of overexertion and competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, with the recent decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still compete effectively while also conserving energy. A theta of 0.70 allows me to hunt effectively without overexerting myself."
