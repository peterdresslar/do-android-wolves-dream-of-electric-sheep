            "I chose this theta because with the increase in the wolf population, competition for food is likely to intensify. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success. This strategy allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics and ensure my survival without risking depletion of resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a tougher hunting environment. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can catch enough food while also conserving energy. Increasing my theta slightly to 0.60 allows me to be more competitive without overexerting myself, especially since the overall wolf population has decreased.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the number of wolves, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves for the same prey. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid drawing attention while still contributing to the pack's survival. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and increase my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, but the wolf population has decreased significantly. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.30, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still taking advantage of the available prey. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, and with fewer wolves around, a moderate hunting intensity will allow me to secure enough food without overexerting myself. This balance helps ensure my survival while still being cautious of the declining wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, but the wolf population has decreased significantly. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if needed. This approach helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment."
