            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.45, I can conserve energy and avoid overexerting myself while still being able to catch enough sheep to survive. This balance allows me to adapt to the current situation without risking starvation.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the increased wolf population. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still contributing to the pack's overall success. This strategy allows me to survive longer in a potentially crowded hunting environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to hunt effectively while conserving energy and avoiding overexertion, which is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with more wolves than sheep, hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts, ensuring my survival in a challenging environment."
