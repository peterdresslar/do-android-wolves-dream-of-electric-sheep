By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can maximize my chances of securing food while still being cautious, as the number of wolves remains the same. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the population of sheep is decreasing, and the number of wolves is also declining. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the decreased wolf population. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still taking advantage of the available prey. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased slightly, indicating a potential for more food. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests competition is fierce. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can take advantage of the available prey while still being cautious about overexerting myself in a dwindling pack.",

However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests competition is fierce. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can take advantage of the sheep while still being cautious about the risks posed by other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. With the recent decrease in the wolf population, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive. This balance helps ensure my survival in a changing environment.",
