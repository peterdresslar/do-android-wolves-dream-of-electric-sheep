            "I chose this theta because while the sheep population has increased, the number of wolves has also risen. A lower hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still contributing to the pack's overall success. This balance helps ensure my survival in a growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can improve my chances of catching enough sheep while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a growing pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival in a crowded environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the wolf population is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves for limited prey. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the wolf population is still high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion, ensuring I have enough energy to survive while still contributing to the pack"
