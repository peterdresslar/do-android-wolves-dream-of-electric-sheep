            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the increased number of wolves. By lowering my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still contributing to the hunt when necessary. This balance helps ensure my survival in a growing pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population means competition for food is rising. With fewer sheep available and more wolves hunting, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. Increasing my hunting intensity slightly will improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival, especially with more wolves around competing for the same resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and while the wolf population has increased, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food without overexerting myself. A slightly higher intensity than before will help me adapt to the current situation and compete effectively."
