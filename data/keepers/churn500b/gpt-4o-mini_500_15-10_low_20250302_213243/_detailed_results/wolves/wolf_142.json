            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population increasing and the number of wolves remaining stable, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success. This way, I can avoid overexertion and ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.40, I can conserve energy while still increasing my chances of catching sheep. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a crowded hunting environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the increase in the wolf population, competition for food is rising. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt, ensuring I have enough resources without overexerting myself. This balance helps me adapt to the changing dynamics of the pack and the dwindling sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the increased number of wolves. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, which may lead to a more sustainable approach to survival in this environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity. By increasing my theta slightly from 0.30 to 0.40, I can take advantage of the available food without overexerting myself, which is important for my survival in a stable wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching enough food while still conserving energy, as the competition with other wolves remains constant.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, but the wolf population has decreased. This suggests that hunting at a lower intensity might be more sustainable, allowing me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, indicating a good opportunity for hunting. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can take advantage of the abundance of prey while still conserving energy compared to maximum intensity. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself, especially since the number of wolves has remained stable."
