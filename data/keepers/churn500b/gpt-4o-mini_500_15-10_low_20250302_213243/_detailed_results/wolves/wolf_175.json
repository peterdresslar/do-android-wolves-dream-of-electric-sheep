            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, which presents a good opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. By setting my intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of depleting resources too quickly, ensuring my survival in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with the wolf population remaining constant, hunting at full intensity may not be sustainable. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's efforts without overexploiting the dwindling prey.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. With fewer wolves around, I can afford to increase my hunting intensity to capitalize on the available resources while still being cautious, as the overall wolf population is decreasing.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, the recent decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition is fierce. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can take advantage of the abundant prey while still being cautious about the risks posed by other wolves."
