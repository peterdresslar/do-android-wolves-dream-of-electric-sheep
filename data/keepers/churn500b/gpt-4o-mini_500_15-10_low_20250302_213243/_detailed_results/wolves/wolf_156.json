            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the stable number of wolves. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can take advantage of the available prey while still conserving energy and reducing the risk of overexertion. This balanced approach helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and avoid competition for limited prey. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while conserving energy, as the competition with other wolves remains high. This approach allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting may be more challenging. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of successfully catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a fluctuating environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low, and the competition among wolves is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid attracting attention from other wolves. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. With the recent decrease in the wolf population, a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive in securing food."
