        "explanations": [
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. This way, I can avoid competition with other wolves and increase my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population means competition for food is rising. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.40, I can conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, allowing me to adapt to the changing dynamics without overexerting myself. This balance helps ensure my survival as I navigate the increased competition.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, indicating a scarcity of food. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competing too aggressively with other wolves, which may also be struggling. This approach increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while also conserving energy. This approach allows me to adapt to the declining prey availability and the increased competition from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the declining wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and a moderate hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's survival. With the recent decrease in both sheep and wolves, a balanced approach is necessary to avoid overexertion and ensure I can continue to hunt in the future."
