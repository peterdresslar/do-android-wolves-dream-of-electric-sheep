However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition is lower, allowing me to hunt with a bit more intensity while still being cautious. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with fewer wolves around, I can afford to increase my hunting intensity without risking overexertion. This balance helps ensure my survival while still allowing for a sustainable hunt.",

This way, I can avoid direct competition with other wolves who may be more aggressive, ensuring my survival in a challenging environment."
