            "I chose this theta because with an increase in the wolf population, competition for food is rising. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.40, I can better secure food while still conserving energy, as the sheep population is not exceedingly high. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still significantly higher than the number of wolves, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity. By increasing my theta from 0.40 to 0.60, I can take advantage of the growing sheep population while still conserving energy and avoiding overexertion, which is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity from 0.60 to 0.75, I can improve my chances of securing enough food while still being mindful of the competition with other wolves. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself."
