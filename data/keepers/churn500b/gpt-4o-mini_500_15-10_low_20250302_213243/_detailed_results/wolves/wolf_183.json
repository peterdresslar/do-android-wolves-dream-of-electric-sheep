            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. This way, I can avoid overexertion and increase my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting may be less fruitful. By increasing my intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the current situation without overexerting myself, ensuring I have enough energy for future hunts while still competing effectively with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating less food availability. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the wolf population is also declining. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who may be hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to survive longer while waiting for a more favorable situation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, with the recent decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food while conserving energy and avoiding overexertion. A moderate intensity of 0.50 allows me to adapt to the changing environment and increase my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition is less intense, allowing me to hunt at a higher intensity without risking overexertion or depletion of resources. A theta of 0.75 balances the need for food with the caution required in a changing environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. By lowering my intensity slightly, I can conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, but the wolf population has decreased. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy and reduce the risk of competition with other wolves while still taking advantage of the available prey.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 11 wolves, competition for food is present but not overwhelming. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of securing food without exhausting myself or risking injury. This balance allows me to adapt to the current situation while still being mindful of the overall wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, which presents a good opportunity for hunting. However, with the number of wolves remaining the same, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can secure enough food without overexerting myself. A theta of 0.75 allows me to be competitive while still conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because with a stable number of wolves and a decent population of sheep, a slightly reduced hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive. This way, I can avoid overexertion and increase my chances of survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, indicating a good opportunity for hunting. By raising my intensity to 0.75, I can take advantage of the higher availability of prey while still conserving some energy for future hunts, as the number of wolves remains constant.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population increasing and the number of wolves remaining stable, a slightly lower hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. This way, I can avoid overexertion and ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with an increase in the wolf population, competition for food is rising. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and reduce the risk of overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a more cautious approach. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the available prey while still conserving energy and minimizing risk, as other wolves may also be hunting at maximum intensity.",
            "I chose this theta because with the increase in the wolf population, competition for food is rising. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival in a more competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity.
