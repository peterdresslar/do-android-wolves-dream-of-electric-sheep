            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, while the wolf population has decreased. This suggests that hunting at a lower intensity may be more sustainable, allowing me to conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who may also be hunting aggressively. A moderate approach will help ensure my survival in this changing environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. Given the recent decrease in the wolf population, a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive in the hunt. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high, and the wolf population has decreased. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who may be hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to ensure my survival while still contributing to the pack's needs."
