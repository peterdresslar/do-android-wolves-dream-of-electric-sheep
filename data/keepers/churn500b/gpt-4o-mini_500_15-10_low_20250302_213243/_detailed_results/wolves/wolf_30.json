            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. However, the increase in the wolf population suggests competition is rising. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of securing food while still being cautious about overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a scarcity of food. With fewer sheep available, hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable, and I risk exhausting myself or competing too fiercely with other wolves. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and with more wolves around, competition for food is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid drawing attention while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment."
