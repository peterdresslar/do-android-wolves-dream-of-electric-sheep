            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt, ensuring my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with the wolf population remaining the same, competition for food is high. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still participating in the hunt. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and increases my chances of survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
