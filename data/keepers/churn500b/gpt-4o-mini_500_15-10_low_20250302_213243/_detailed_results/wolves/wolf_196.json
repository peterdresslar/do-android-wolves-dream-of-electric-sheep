            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting more competitive. With more wolves around, a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This balance increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself in a potentially scarce environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the wolf population is also declining. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are likely hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and I need to balance my energy expenditure with the likelihood of a successful hunt. By increasing my intensity to 0.50, I can take advantage of the current situation without overexerting myself, considering the recent decline in both sheep and wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the reduced number of wolves. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still taking advantage of the available prey. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, indicating more food availability. However, the number of wolves remains the same, which means competition for food is still present. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly to 0.40, I can take advantage of the higher sheep numbers while still being cautious about overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. By increasing my intensity slightly from my previous theta of 0.40 to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of competition from other wolves, who are also hunting at maximum intensity. This way, I can ensure my survival while still being cautious.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the number of wolves. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and reduce competition with other wolves while still contributing to the pack's success. This strategy allows me to survive longer in a stable environment."
