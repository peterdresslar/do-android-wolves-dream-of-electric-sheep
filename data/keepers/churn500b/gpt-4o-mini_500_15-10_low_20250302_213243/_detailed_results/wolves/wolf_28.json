            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting more challenging. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts. This strategy increases my chances of survival by avoiding competition with other wolves for limited prey.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high with their numbers also dropping. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, while still maintaining a chance to catch prey when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a scarcity of food. Increasing my hunting intensity slightly to 0.60 allows me to be more competitive without overexerting myself, which is crucial given the recent decline in the wolf population. This balance helps ensure my survival while still being mindful of the overall situation."
