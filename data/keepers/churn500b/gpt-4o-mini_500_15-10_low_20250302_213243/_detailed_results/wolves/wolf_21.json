            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, it's wise to conserve energy and avoid competition. A slightly lower intensity allows me to adapt to the changing environment while still being effective.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with the wolf population remaining the same, hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's survival, especially as resources are limited.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the competition among wolves is high with a recent decline in their numbers. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise."
