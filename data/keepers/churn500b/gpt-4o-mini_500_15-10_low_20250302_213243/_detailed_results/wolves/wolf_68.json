            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, and the number of wolves has increased.

            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the declining wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, while the wolf population has decreased. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can take advantage of the available prey without overexerting myself, as the competition among wolves is still present. This balance helps ensure my survival while still being cautious.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting. However, with the recent decrease in the wolf population, I need to be cautious and not overexert myself. A theta of 0.75 allows me to hunt effectively while also conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. With the wolf population decreasing, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, ensuring my survival while still being effective in hunting."
