A slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, increasing my chances of survival.",

By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy and reduce competition with other wolves while still taking advantage of the available prey. This balance helps ensure my survival in a fluctuating environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition is less intense. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can take advantage of the abundant food while still being cautious, ensuring my survival without overexerting myself.",
