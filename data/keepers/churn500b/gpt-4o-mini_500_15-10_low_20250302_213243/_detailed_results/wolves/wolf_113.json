            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By reducing my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and avoid overexerting myself while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival in a more competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased significantly, which means competition for food is higher. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's efforts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a more competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of catching enough food while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a growing pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 17 wolves competing for food, a slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This strategy helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased significantly, which means competition for food is higher. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively when necessary. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a crowded environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to hunt effectively while conserving energy, as the competition among wolves is rising. This way, I can still secure food without overexerting myself in a potentially dwindling resource environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting may be more challenging. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy, as the overall wolf population has remained stable.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with the number of wolves remaining the same, hunting at maximum intensity may lead to overexploitation of the sheep. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and adapt to the changing environment while still contributing to the pack's survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the wolf population is also declining. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are likely to hunt at maximum intensity. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment."
