            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with the number of wolves remaining constant, I can afford to hunt with less intensity. This allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive in the hunt. A lower intensity may also help me avoid overexertion and potential conflicts with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, making competition for food more intense. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased slightly, and the wolf population remains stable. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are likely hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a fluctuating environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population decreasing slightly and the number of wolves remaining stable, it's important to balance my hunting intensity. A theta of 0.50 allows me to increase my chances of catching prey without overexerting myself, ensuring I can sustain my energy for future hunts while still being competitive.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and risk of injury. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and wait for a better opportunity to hunt when the sheep population stabilizes.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making them scarcer. With more wolves in the area, I need to balance my hunting intensity to avoid competition while still ensuring I can secure enough food. A moderate intensity allows me to be efficient without overexerting myself or attracting too much attention from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests competition is still present. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can take advantage of the available prey while still being cautious about the competition from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. By lowering my intensity slightly, I can conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This also allows me to adapt to the current situation where the number of wolves remains the same, reducing competition for resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests competition is lower, so I can afford to increase my hunting intensity to secure enough food while still being mindful of the risks involved.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with the number of wolves remaining stable, a slightly reduced hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, but the wolf population has decreased. This suggests that there may be less competition for food, allowing me to hunt with less intensity while still being effective. A lower theta will help conserve energy and increase my chances of survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, which means there is enough food available. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can take advantage of the current situation without overexerting myself, ensuring I have energy for future hunts while still competing effectively with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. By increasing my intensity to 0.75, I can take advantage of the higher prey availability while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because with the number of sheep increasing and the wolf population remaining stable, I can afford to hunt at a slightly lower intensity. This allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success. A theta of 0.60 balances my need for survival with the competition from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. By increasing my intensity to 0.75, I can take advantage of the higher availability of prey while still conserving some energy for future hunts, considering that the wolf population remains stable.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, which means there is enough food available. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success. This approach allows me to avoid overexertion and increases my chances of survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, which means there is enough food to go around. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, ensuring my survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because with 47.57 sheep and 11 wolves, the competition is moderate. A theta of 0.50 allows me to hunt effectively without overexerting myself, balancing the need to secure food while conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the number of wolves, which means competition for food is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt when necessary. This strategy allows me to survive longer in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with 53.87 sheep and 14 wolves, the competition for food is moderate. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure enough food for survival while avoiding overexertion that could lead to unnecessary risks. This way, I can adapt to the current situation without fully committing to maximum intensity, allowing me to conserve energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, which means there is enough food available.
