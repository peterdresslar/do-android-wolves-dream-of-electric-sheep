            "I chose this theta because the decrease in the wolf population suggests competition for food is increasing, and I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough prey without exhausting myself or attracting too much attention from other wolves. A moderate intensity allows me to be efficient while being cautious."
