            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, which means competition for food is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still having a chance to catch prey. This strategy allows me to survive longer in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making them scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and less food for everyone. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt, ensuring my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting more competitive among wolves. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can better ensure my survival while still conserving some energy for future hunts, as I anticipate that the sheep population may continue to decline."
