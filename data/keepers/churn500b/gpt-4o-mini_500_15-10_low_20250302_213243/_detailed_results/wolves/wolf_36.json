            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's efforts. This balance may help ensure my survival as resources are limited and competition is high.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a scarcity of food. With fewer sheep available, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves and potential overexertion without sufficient reward. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, and the wolf population has decreased. A moderate hunting intensity allows me to balance the need for food while being cautious about the dwindling wolf numbers. This way, I can still contribute to the pack's survival without overexerting myself or risking injury.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the number of wolves, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves for the same prey. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid unnecessary confrontations, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests competition is fierce. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting."
