            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can contribute to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, which means competition for food is increasing. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the situation without overexerting myself, ensuring I have enough energy for future hunts while still contributing to my pack",
            "I chose this theta because with an increase in the wolf population, competition for food is higher. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a potentially competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my intensity slightly from 0.65 to 0.75, I can improve my chances of a successful hunt while still conserving energy for future needs. This balance is crucial for my survival as the competition remains high with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the competition among wolves is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This balance increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the population of sheep is decreasing, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to overexertion and potential starvation. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and increase my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased slightly, indicating a better food supply. However, with the number of wolves remaining the same, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can secure enough food while avoiding overexertion. A theta of 0.60 allows me to hunt effectively without risking depletion of my energy reserves."
