            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a more moderate hunting intensity. By increasing my theta from 0.21 to 0.35, I can take advantage of the current sheep population while still conserving energy and avoiding competition with other wolves who may be hunting at maximum intensity.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that food is becoming scarcer. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.40, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are likely to hunt at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to survive longer while waiting for a more favorable situation.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating that hunting may be more challenging. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts, considering the overall decline in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the competition among wolves is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and reduce the risk of overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the declining wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, with the recent decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still compete with other wolves while not overexerting myself. A moderate intensity of 0.50 allows me to take advantage of the available prey without risking exhaustion or attracting too much attention.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, with the recent decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still secure food without overexerting myself or risking injury. A theta of 0.70 allows me to hunt effectively while being mindful of the competition and my own survival."
