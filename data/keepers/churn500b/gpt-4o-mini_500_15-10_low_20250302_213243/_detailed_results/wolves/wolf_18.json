            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the current situation without overexerting myself. This allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.40, I can better secure my share of the dwindling sheep population without overexerting myself, which could lead to exhaustion or injury.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. However, the increase in the wolf population suggests competition for food is rising. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can better compete for the limited resources while still being cautious not to overexert myself given the current sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, which means hunting is becoming more challenging. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can maximize my chances of catching enough food while still being mindful of the competition with other wolves. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to wasted energy and increased competition with other wolves. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting."
