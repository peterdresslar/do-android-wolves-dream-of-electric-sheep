            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 12 wolves competing for food, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still increasing my chances of a successful hunt. This way, I can adapt to the competition without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a more cautious approach. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the available prey while minimizing the risk of overexertion and competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, which means there is enough food available. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can take advantage of the situation without overexerting myself, allowing for a balance between energy expenditure and food acquisition. This way, I can ensure my survival while still being cautious of the increasing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and I want to balance my hunting efforts to ensure I can catch enough food while conserving energy. By increasing my intensity slightly from my previous theta, I can take advantage of the current sheep numbers without overexerting myself, which is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival as the competition remains high with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting may be less fruitful. By lowering my intensity slightly, I can conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. This approach balances the need to secure food with the risk of overexertion in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the declining wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can better compete for food while still conserving energy, as the sheep population is not high. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, but the wolf population has decreased. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests competition is still present. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can take advantage of the higher sheep count while still being cautious about the competition from other wolves."
