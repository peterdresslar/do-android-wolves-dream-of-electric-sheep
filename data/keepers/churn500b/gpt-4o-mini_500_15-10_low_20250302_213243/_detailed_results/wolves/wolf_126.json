            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and I need to balance my energy expenditure with the need to hunt effectively. By increasing my intensity to 0.50, I can contribute to the hunt without overexerting myself, especially since the number of wolves has decreased. This way, I can ensure my survival while still being part of the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the number of wolves, which suggests that hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves and potential failure to secure food. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and reduce the risk of confrontation, while still allowing for a chance to catch prey if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests competition is fierce. By choosing a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, balancing my need for survival with the risks of overexertion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, which means there is more food available. However, with the number of wolves remaining the same, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and overhunting. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. With the wolf population decreasing, a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive in the hunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 12 wolves competing for food, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still having a chance to hunt successfully. This strategy helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with 36.20 sheep and 11 wolves, the competition for food is significant. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of securing enough food while still being cautious not to overexert myself, as the wolf population hasn",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting. By increasing my intensity to 0.75, I can take advantage of the higher number of sheep while still conserving some energy for future hunts, especially since the number of wolves has remained constant.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a more cautious approach. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to catch enough prey to survive.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased significantly, which means competition for food will be higher. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and reduce the risk of confrontation with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively when necessary.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance my need for sustenance with the risk of overexerting myself in a potentially competitive environment. This way, I can still hunt effectively while conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy and avoid competition while still allowing for some hunting. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, and with the number of wolves remaining constant, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still find enough food without overexerting myself.
