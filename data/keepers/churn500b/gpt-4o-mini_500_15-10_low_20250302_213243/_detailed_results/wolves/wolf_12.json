            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population increasing and the number of wolves remaining stable, I can afford to increase my hunting intensity slightly. A theta of 0.40 allows me to take advantage of the growing sheep population while still being cautious, as I don't want to overexert myself and risk injury or depletion of resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing more food resources. However, the number of wolves has also risen, which increases competition. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance my energy expenditure while still contributing to the pack's success, ensuring my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because with an increase in both sheep and wolves, hunting at a higher intensity will improve my chances of securing food while still being cautious not to overexert myself. A theta of 0.65 allows me to be competitive without risking exhaustion.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a sustainable hunt. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, ensuring my survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.65, I can improve my chances of securing enough food while still being cautious not to overexert myself, given the current sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased significantly, which means competition for food is higher. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid overexerting myself while still contributing to the pack's needs. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low, and the competition among wolves is high due to their recent decrease. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment."
