        "explanations": [
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 120.10, which is only 12.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for gradual adjustments.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 43.14, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. A lower theta value will help reduce hunting intensity and give the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, while also allowing the wolf population to stabilize without competing too aggressively.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and my previous theta was already on the lower end. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for a modest increase in hunting intensity, which can help sustain my pack while still giving the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their extinction. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while still competing with other wolves. This balance is essential for the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 0.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population, which is crucial for the sustainability of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to replenish while also managing competition with other wolves. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 5.68, which is only 0.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow the sheep to recover while still considering the needs of the wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a cautious approach to hunting, promoting a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep can rebound."
