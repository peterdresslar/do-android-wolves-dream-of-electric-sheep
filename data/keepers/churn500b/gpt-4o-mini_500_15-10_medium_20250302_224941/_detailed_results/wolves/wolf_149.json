            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level (15.4% of maximum capacity), allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still being cautious. This value maintains a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species. It allows for sustainable coexistence while gradually adapting to the current population dynamics.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 7.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that a more cautious approach is needed to allow for recovery. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can help the sheep population stabilize while still competing with other wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.36, which is only 2.4% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep population. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition with other wolves. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of my ancestors, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and my previous theta was already on the lower end. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for a bit more hunting to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep further. This approach helps maintain a balance as the sheep population recovers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 6.72, which is only 0.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are in a vulnerable state, and I need to prioritize their recovery while still allowing for some hunting to support the wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will help maintain a balance, allowing for sustainable coexistence without depleting the sheep further."
