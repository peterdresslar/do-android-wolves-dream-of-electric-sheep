            "I chose this theta because it represents a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balanced approach. The sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and a moderate increase in hunting will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. This adjustment allows for a dynamic response to the current conditions while keeping the long-term survival of both species in mind.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 42.96, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing competition among wolves, which will help stabilize our numbers and give sheep a chance to rebound.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, it is crucial to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent further depletion of the sheep population, while also being mindful of the growing wolf population."
