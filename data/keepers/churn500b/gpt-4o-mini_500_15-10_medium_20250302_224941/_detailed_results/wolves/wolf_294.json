            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.7% of its maximum capacity, and my previous theta was quite low at 0.247. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate increase to 0.30 allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without overwhelming the sheep, promoting sustainable coexistence.",

To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. This lower theta will help maintain a balance and prevent a crash in the ecosystem."
