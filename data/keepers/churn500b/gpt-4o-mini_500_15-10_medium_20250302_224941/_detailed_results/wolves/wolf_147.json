            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low percentage of its maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This value reflects a balanced approach, enabling sustainable coexistence while still allowing for some growth in the wolf population. It also considers the need to avoid sudden changes, maintaining stability in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 120.10, which is only 12.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is potential for recovery in the sheep population if I reduce my hunting intensity slightly. By adjusting theta to 0.40, I can focus on maintaining a balance that allows for sustainable coexistence while still ensuring the wolf population remains healthy.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 7.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow for recovery. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from the previous theta, I can still support the wolf population while prioritizing the sustainability of the sheep. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 43.14, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain a balance and avoid depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and a slight increase in hunting intensity will help sustain our population without depleting the sheep too quickly. This adjustment allows for a gradual response to the current conditions while still focusing on the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To allow the sheep to recover, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting intensively. This will help stabilize the ecosystem and ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 0.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta value will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can increase, which is crucial for the long-term survival of both species."
