            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 43.14, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. Given the high wolf population of 123, it is crucial to focus on competition among wolves to allow the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting, ensuring both species can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.36, which is only 2.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to increase their numbers. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.30 to 0.35, I can still maintain some hunting pressure while prioritizing the sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable for hunting. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent further depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a significant competition for resources. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help sustain my pack while allowing the sheep population to recover gradually. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.5% of maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while avoiding over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep population to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.4% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting sheep. This will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.4% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also maintaining a healthy wolf population. A gradual increase in theta will help balance hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 0.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to increase, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem."
