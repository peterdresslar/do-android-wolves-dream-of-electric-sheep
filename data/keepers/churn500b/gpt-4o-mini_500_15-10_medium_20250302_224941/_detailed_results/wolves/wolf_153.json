            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.4% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 120.10, which is only 12.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting without risking depletion. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.40, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting, so a slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach while still considering the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 7.8% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling wolves to compete effectively. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable for hunting. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to recover while ensuring the long-term survival of both species."
