            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 26.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain our wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover. This approach balances our immediate needs with the long-term health of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 27.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with a relatively high sheep-to-wolf ratio of 21.43, I need to be cautious not to overhunt and deplete the sheep population too quickly. A slight reduction from my previous theta allows for continued hunting while also considering the long-term balance between wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 28.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with a wolf population of 25, I need to be cautious not to overhunt and risk depleting the sheep too quickly. A moderate increase in hunting intensity allows for a balanced approach that supports both wolf reproduction and sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 27.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 48, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both populations can thrive. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.7% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are nearly as many wolves as sheep. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover. A moderate theta value of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 42.96, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help balance the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population, which is crucial for the sustainability of our pack."
