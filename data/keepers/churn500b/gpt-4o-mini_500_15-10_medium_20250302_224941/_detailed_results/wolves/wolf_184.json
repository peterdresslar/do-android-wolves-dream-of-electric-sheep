            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level (12.0% of maximum capacity), allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover over time. A gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta value will help balance the competition among wolves and allow for some hunting without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low at 0.09. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while giving sheep a chance to rebound.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 6.72, which is only 0.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a slight hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.30 to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence and preventing a drastic decline in sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable for sustainable hunting. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover, ensuring a healthier ecosystem in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, it is essential to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure and promote a more sustainable ecosystem.",

This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
