            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help sustain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover and thrive. A balanced approach is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 149.70, which is only 15.0% of its maximum capacity. While I need to maintain a balance to ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, a slight decrease from my previous theta of 0.65 allows for a more sustainable approach. This adjustment will help prevent overhunting while still enabling some reproduction among the wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.8% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This value balances the need for wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover, promoting a sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and while it is important to maintain a healthy wolf population, I need to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate hunting intensity will help balance our needs without depleting the sheep further, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 95.94, which is only 9.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that considers both the need for wolf reproduction and the recovery of the sheep population.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 49.30, which is only 4.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves and allow the sheep population to gradually increase, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.96, which is only 2.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a modest hunting intensity while still prioritizing the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.20, which is only 1.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species."
