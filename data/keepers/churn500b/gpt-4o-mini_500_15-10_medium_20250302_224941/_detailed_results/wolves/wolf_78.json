            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are more sheep available relative to wolves. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will allow for sustainable coexistence while still enabling the wolf population to thrive. This adjustment is gradual, aligning with the wisdom of maintaining balance and responding to changing conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 49.30, which is only 4.9% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for some hunting to support reproduction while not overexploiting the sheep, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.31, which is only 3.4% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure and promote sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.20, which is only 1.9% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity and give the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, while also managing the competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.42, which is only 1.5% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on a balanced approach that allows the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting to maintain our wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will help in this regard without overwhelming the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.2% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.18, which is only 0.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are under pressure and need time to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity to 0.35, I can still support my pack"
