            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help support wolf reproduction while still ensuring that the sheep population can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is necessary to maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain our wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and sustain their numbers. A gradual adjustment is key to avoiding sudden population crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 15.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 4.68, I need to be cautious not to overhunt and deplete the sheep population too quickly. A slight reduction from my previous theta allows for continued hunting while also considering the long-term balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. This balance will help maintain both populations in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 49.30, which is only 4.9% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing competition with other wolves, which will help stabilize our numbers and promote a sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.31, which is only 3.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover, and focusing on competition with other wolves will help stabilize the wolf population while allowing the sheep to bounce back. A lower theta will promote a healthier ecosystem in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.96, which is only 2.5% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the survival of my pack, I must also allow the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will enable me to hunt more effectively while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep."
