            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual increase in theta will help maintain a balance while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 70.82, which is only 7.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing from my previous theta of 0.25 to 0.30, I can focus on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the wolf population is relatively high. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help sustain our pack while allowing the sheep to recover. This adjustment is small enough to avoid drastic impacts on the ecosystem, promoting a balanced approach.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.31, which is only 3.4% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.96, which is only 2.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is a need for cautious hunting to allow the sheep to recover while still ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach that supports both the wolves and the sheep without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.20, which is only 1.9% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting sheep. This will help stabilize both populations over time.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.42, which is only 1.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to sustain itself. A gradual increase in theta will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep further."
