            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is necessary to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 18.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with a relatively high wolf population of 31, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A moderate theta of 0.55 allows for a balanced approach, ensuring that both sheep and wolves can thrive without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity. This will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term survival for both. Gradually adjusting to a slightly lower theta will also allow for competition among wolves while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, allowing for some hunting without risking depletion. However, with the wolf population also being relatively high, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 7.8% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help achieve this balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at only 2.4% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a significant competition for resources among wolves. By focusing on competition rather than hunting, I can allow the sheep population to recover while ensuring the long-term survival of both species. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 1.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a modest increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach helps maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the long-term survival of both species."
