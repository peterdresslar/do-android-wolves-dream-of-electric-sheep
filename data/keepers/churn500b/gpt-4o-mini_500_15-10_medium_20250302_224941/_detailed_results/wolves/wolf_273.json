            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.7% of maximum capacity, indicating that they can recover if I reduce my hunting intensity slightly. A theta of 0.55 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting to support the wolf population. This gradual adjustment helps avoid sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 42.96, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, focusing too much on hunting could lead to further depletion of the sheep. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while also giving the sheep a chance to recover, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep to recover. This lower theta value will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.64, which is just 0.2% of its maximum capacity. Maintaining a low hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover and prevents further depletion. Given the current wolf population is high, focusing on competition among wolves rather than hunting is essential for long-term sustainability."
