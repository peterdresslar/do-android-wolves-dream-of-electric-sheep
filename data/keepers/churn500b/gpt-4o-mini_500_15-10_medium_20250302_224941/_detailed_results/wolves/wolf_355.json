            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.7% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This balance will help sustain both the wolf and sheep populations while allowing for gradual adjustments as conditions change.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 42.96, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for some hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a severe scarcity of prey. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than hunting sheep, I can help the sheep population stabilize and eventually grow, ensuring a sustainable ecosystem for both species in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity. Increasing hunting intensity at this stage could lead to the extinction of sheep, which would ultimately harm the wolf population as well. A lower theta allows for a focus on competition with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to recover, ensuring a more sustainable ecosystem in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 0.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating a severe depletion. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows for the potential recovery of the sheep population while also addressing the competition among wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims to ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.30, which indicates that aggressive hunting would further deplete their numbers and jeopardize the long-term survival of both species. By focusing on competition with other wolves at a lower theta, I can allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a sustainable wolf population."
