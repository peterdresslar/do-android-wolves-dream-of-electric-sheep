            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 33\n- Sheep population: 149.70\n- Wolf population: 32.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.924\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 4.68 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 15.0% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 149.70, which is only 15.0% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking the depletion of the sheep population. By setting theta at 0.80, I can ensure that we maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover over time.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level (13.8% of maximum capacity), allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 12.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 60, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both populations can thrive. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while still considering the long-term balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.96, which is only 2.5% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.45 strikes a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability without depleting the sheep further."
