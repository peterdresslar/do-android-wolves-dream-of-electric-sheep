            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 42.96, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.4 allows for a balanced approach, reducing hunting intensity to support sheep recovery while still competing with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity. Focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to recover, ensuring a sustainable future for both species. Gradually reducing hunting intensity is essential to avoid depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity. Increasing hunting intensity could lead to the extinction of sheep, which would ultimately harm the wolf population as well. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competition with other wolves while allowing the sheep population a chance to recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 0.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating a critical depletion. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows for the potential recovery of the sheep population while also considering the current high wolf population. This balance is essential for the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.30, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is 0.00. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent further depletion of the sheep."
