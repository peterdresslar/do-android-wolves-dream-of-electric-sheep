            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.0% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking immediate depletion. This adjustment will help sustain our wolf population while still allowing sheep to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With 129.02 sheep and a wolf population of 6.00, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is high, indicating that we can afford to reduce hunting intensity slightly to ensure long-term coexistence. This adjustment will help maintain both populations without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level (13.8% of maximum capacity), allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This balance will help sustain both the wolf and sheep populations while avoiding overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a balance as the sheep population grows, while also being cautious not to overhunt given the current wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. It reflects a balanced approach, responding to the current conditions and trends.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight decrease in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a balance as the wolf population grows, ensuring that both species can thrive without depleting resources too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.0% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.6% of maximum capacity, indicating that they need time to recover. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 70.82, which is only 7.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is potential for recovery if I reduce hunting intensity slightly. By increasing theta from 0.35 to 0.40, I can still maintain some hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is quite low at 49.30, which is only 4.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 represents a moderate approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to sustain the pack. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.31, which is only 3.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and ensures the long-term survival of both species."
