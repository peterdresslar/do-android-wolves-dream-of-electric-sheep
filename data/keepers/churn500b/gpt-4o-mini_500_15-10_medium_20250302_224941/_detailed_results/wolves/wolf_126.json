            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and my previous theta was quite low. To ensure the sheep can recover while still allowing for some hunting, I will gradually increase my hunting intensity. This approach will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level (17.4% of maximum capacity), allowing for a gradual increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate approach will help maintain a balance between the wolf and sheep populations while allowing for some growth in the wolf pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover and thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 43.14, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 strikes a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can stabilize and grow, promoting long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a significant competition for resources among wolves. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and the need for a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their extinction. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem."
