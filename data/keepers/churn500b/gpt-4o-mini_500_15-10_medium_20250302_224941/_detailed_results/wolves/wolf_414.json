            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 42.96, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to ensure our wolf population remains healthy. A theta of 0.4 strikes a balance between competing with other wolves and allowing the sheep to increase in number, promoting long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a severe depletion of prey. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing competition among wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. This lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population, which is essential for the sustainability of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 0.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating a critical depletion. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves and reduce hunting intensity. This gradual adjustment will help restore balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.21, and my previous theta of 0.200 was too focused on competition with other wolves. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity to 0.25, I aim to encourage sheep recovery while still being cautious not to deplete them further. This small adjustment allows for a more sustainable approach as I monitor the trends in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.21, which is only 0.0% of its maximum capacity. Focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to recover, ensuring a sustainable future for both species. A gradual approach is necessary to avoid depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.23, which is only 0.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should remain low to allow the sheep to recover. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.200 to 0.25 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for wolf survival while giving sheep a chance to rebound."
