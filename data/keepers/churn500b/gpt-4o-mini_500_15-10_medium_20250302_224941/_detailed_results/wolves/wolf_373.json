            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 42.96, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that a more moderate hunting approach is necessary to allow the sheep to recover while still ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. A theta of 0.4 strikes a balance between hunting and competing with other wolves, promoting sustainability in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can help create a more sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity. Focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to recover while ensuring our pack does not overhunt and face a potential collapse. A gradual reduction in hunting intensity is necessary to maintain balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to replenish while also managing competition with other wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of sustainable coexistence and avoids sudden population crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their extinction. Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover while also managing the competition among wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.26, which means aggressive hunting could lead to their extinction. By focusing on competition with other wolves and reducing hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.24, and my previous theta of 0.200 was too focused on competition with other wolves. A slight increase to 0.25 allows for a more balanced approach, enabling some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining sustainable cycles.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.22, which means aggressive hunting could lead to their extinction. By lowering my hunting intensity, I allow the sheep population a chance to recover while also managing competition with other wolves."
