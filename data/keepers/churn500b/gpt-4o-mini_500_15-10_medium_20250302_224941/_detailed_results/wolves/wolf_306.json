            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.7% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This balance will help sustain both the wolf and sheep populations while allowing for gradual adjustments as conditions change.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 42.96, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. This will help balance the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population, while also allowing for some wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can help the sheep population stabilize while also managing the competition with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their extinction. By focusing more on competing with other wolves, I can allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a sustainable wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their depletion and threaten the long-term survival of both species. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This balance will help ensure sustainable cycles in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their extinction.
