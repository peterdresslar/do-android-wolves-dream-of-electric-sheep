            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 18.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with a relatively high sheep-to-wolf ratio of 8.60, I need to be cautious not to overhunt, as this could lead to a depletion of sheep and ultimately harm the wolf population. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach that supports both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. This moderate intensity will help maintain both the wolf and sheep populations while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep. It also allows for gradual adjustments as conditions change, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting approach. This will help maintain the balance between wolf and sheep populations while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need for gradual adjustments, a slight decrease from my previous theta will support both immediate needs and long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.0% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term survival of both species. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance as the sheep recover, while also considering the growing wolf population."
