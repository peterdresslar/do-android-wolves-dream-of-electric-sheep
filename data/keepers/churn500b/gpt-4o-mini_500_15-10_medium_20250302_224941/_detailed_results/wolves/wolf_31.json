            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.0% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This balance will help sustain both the sheep and wolf populations while adapting to the current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, allowing for some hunting without risking depletion. However, with a relatively high sheep-to-wolf ratio, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 70.82, which is only 7.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By adopting a lower theta value, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize and gradually increase. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 49.30, which is only 4.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.31, which is only 3.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should remain low to allow the sheep to recover. However, with a wolf population of 94, I need to slightly increase my hunting intensity to ensure the wolves can sustain themselves without depleting the sheep too quickly. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for wolf survival while allowing sheep to rebound.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 2.5% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting sheep. This will allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a stable wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.42, which is only 1.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity to 0.35, I can still focus on competition with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem."
