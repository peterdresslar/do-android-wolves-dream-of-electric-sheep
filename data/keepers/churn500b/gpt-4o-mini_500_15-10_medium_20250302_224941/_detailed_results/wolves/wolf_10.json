            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 39\n- Sheep population: 34.31\n- Wolf population: 94.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.300\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.37 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 3.4% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.2% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 110.92, which is only 11.1% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.35 aligns with the wisdom of making small adjustments based on current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.0% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious. This moderate adjustment helps maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, allowing for some hunting without risking depletion. However, with a relatively high sheep-to-wolf ratio, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help sustain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. It is a moderate increase that reflects the need for balance as we adapt to the current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance of the ecosystem. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to ensure sustainable coexistence, as the sheep population is recovering but not yet at maximum capacity.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This will help support wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.0% of maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite high at 4.68. This suggests that while there is an opportunity for hunting, it is crucial to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 138.34, which is only 13.8% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.35 helps maintain balance and avoids sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 70.82, which is only 7.1% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and avoid depleting their numbers further, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting intensively. This moderate approach will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem while ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 49.30, which is only 4.9% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.31, which is only 3.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should be cautious about hunting too intensely to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 to 0.35 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for some hunting while still prioritizing the sustainability of both populations."
