            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 164\n- Sheep population: 274.85\n- Wolf population: 48.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.056\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 5.73 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 27.5% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 27.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 48, I need to be cautious about overhunting. A moderate theta allows for sustainable coexistence while enabling the sheep to recover and ensuring the wolf population remains healthy.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 23.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for increased hunting without risking immediate depletion. However, with the wolf population at 89, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure sustainability. A gradual increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach that supports both wolf reproduction and sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.7% of maximum capacity, indicating that a moderate approach to hunting is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.4 to 0.45, I can maintain a balance that supports both the wolf population and the sheep, avoiding overexploitation while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By focusing more on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can allow the sheep population to stabilize and grow, ensuring long-term survival for both species. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help balance the ecosystem without depleting the sheep further."
