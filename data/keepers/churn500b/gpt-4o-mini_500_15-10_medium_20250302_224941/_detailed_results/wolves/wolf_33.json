            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. This will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, as well as adapt to the current conditions without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 70.82, which is only 7.1% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a focus on competition with other wolves, a lower theta value will help balance the ecosystem. This adjustment will support the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.96, which is only 2.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.30 maintains a focus on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, promoting a gradual balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.20, which is only 1.9% of its maximum capacity. While I need to focus on hunting to ensure the survival of my pack, I must also be cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a more balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low at 0.21. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. This lower hunting intensity will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem."
