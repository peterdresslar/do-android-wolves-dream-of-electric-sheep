            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure and give the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, while still allowing for some competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 6.72, which is only 0.7% of its maximum capacity. While I need to focus on hunting to ensure the survival of my pack, I must also be cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, enabling sustainable coexistence while still considering the need for my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 0.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates a need for recovery, and by focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help the sheep population rebound. A lower theta will allow for a sustainable balance, ensuring both wolves and sheep can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover while also reducing competition among wolves. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. A gradual decrease in hunting will help maintain a balance and prevent a crash in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.4% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. Focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to recover while maintaining our wolf population. A gradual approach is necessary to avoid depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.4% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.4% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well.
