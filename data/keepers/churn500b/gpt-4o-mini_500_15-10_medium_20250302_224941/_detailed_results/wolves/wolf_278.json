            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 165\n- Sheep population: 232.38\n- Wolf population: 89.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.476\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 2.61 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 23.2% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 23.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the long-term health of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without risking depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for more hunting to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious to avoid overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the wolf population is relatively high. A lower theta allows for more competition among wolves, which can help stabilize our numbers while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem."
