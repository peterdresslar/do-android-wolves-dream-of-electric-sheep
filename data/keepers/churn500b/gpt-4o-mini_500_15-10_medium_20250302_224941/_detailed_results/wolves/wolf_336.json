            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.7% of its maximum capacity, and my previous theta was quite low. A gradual increase to 0.25 allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach helps maintain a balance between my needs and the sustainability of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 42.96, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.30 represents a moderate approach, balancing the need to compete with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to sustain our population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. This gradual approach will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution in hunting. While I must ensure the survival of my pack, I also recognize the importance of allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term balance of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity. Increasing hunting intensity at this stage could lead to the extinction of sheep, which would ultimately harm the wolf population as well. A lower theta allows for some competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.30, which indicates that aggressive hunting would further deplete their numbers and threaten the ecosystem. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a stable wolf population. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of my ancestors to avoid sudden changes and promote long-term survival."
