            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 165\n- Sheep population: 232.38\n- Wolf population: 89.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.175\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 2.61 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 23.2% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.2% of its maximum capacity, and my previous theta of 0.175 indicates a focus on competition rather than hunting. To allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a gradual increase in hunting intensity, I will raise theta slightly. This will help balance the needs of both populations without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.7% of its maximum capacity, and my previous theta was quite low at 0.25. To allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a focus on competition with other wolves, I will increase my hunting intensity slightly to 0.30. This adjustment will help ensure a sustainable balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 42.96, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity. Focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to recover, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem. Given the high wolf population, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By lowering my hunting intensity further, I can allow the sheep to rebound while also managing the competition with other wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance."
