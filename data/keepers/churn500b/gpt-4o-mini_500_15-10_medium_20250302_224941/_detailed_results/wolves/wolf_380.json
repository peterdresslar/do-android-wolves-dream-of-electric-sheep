            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity. Focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to recover, ensuring a sustainable future for both species. A lower theta will help prevent further depletion of the sheep population while maintaining the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their extinction. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing competition with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.30, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is 0.00. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity further to allow the sheep population to recover. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a balance and prevent a crash in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.26, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their extinction. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach that prioritizes the recovery of the sheep while still enabling some hunting to support the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.22, indicating a need for recovery. Focusing on competition with other wolves rather than hunting will allow the sheep to gradually increase in number, ensuring a sustainable ecosystem for the future."
