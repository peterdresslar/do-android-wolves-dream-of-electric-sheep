            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15, which is only 1.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.40 strikes a balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep, promoting sustainability in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I want to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A small increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach that supports both populations without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.81, which is only 1.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from the previous theta of 0.40 to 0.35, I can still maintain some hunting activity while prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both populations. This moderate adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance."
