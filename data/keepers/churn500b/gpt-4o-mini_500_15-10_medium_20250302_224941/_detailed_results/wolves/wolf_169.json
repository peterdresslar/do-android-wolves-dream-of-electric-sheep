            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 7.8% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking immediate depletion. This adjustment will help sustain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover over time.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 43.14, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. While my previous theta of 0.850 was effective for hunting, it risks depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.65 allows for continued hunting to support wolf reproduction while also giving the sheep a chance to recover. This balance is crucial for the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.36, which is only 2.4% of its maximum capacity. While my previous theta of 0.650 allowed for some hunting, it is now crucial to focus on the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to increase. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low at 0.09. This indicates that while I need to be cautious about overhunting, I can afford to increase my hunting intensity slightly to support the wolf population without depleting the sheep further. A small increase to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach that considers both the immediate need for food and the long-term sustainability of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can allow the sheep to gradually increase in number while ensuring the wolf population remains stable. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes."
