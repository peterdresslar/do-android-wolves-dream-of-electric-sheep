            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level (15.4% of maximum capacity), and while there is an opportunity to increase hunting, it is crucial to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while also focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring that both populations can recover and thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 77.57, which is only 7.8% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.35 aligns with the wisdom of making small adjustments in response to current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 43.14, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover rather than intensifying our hunting. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash."
