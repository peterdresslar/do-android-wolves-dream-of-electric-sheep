            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 164\n- Sheep population: 274.85\n- Wolf population: 48.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.218\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 5.73 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 27.5% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 27.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, the wolf population is relatively stable, and I want to avoid overhunting to ensure sustainable coexistence. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, enabling both sheep and wolves to thrive without depleting resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.7% of maximum capacity, indicating that they need some time to recover. While my previous theta was focused on competition with other wolves, a slight increase to 0.35 allows for a moderate hunting approach that can help sustain both populations without depleting the sheep further. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining balance and responding to current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 42.96, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover, and focusing on competition with other wolves will help maintain our population while allowing the sheep to bounce back. A lower theta will support long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To allow the sheep to recover and avoid depleting their numbers further, I need to focus on competing with other wolves rather than intensifying hunting. This will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem and ensure long-term survival for both species."
