            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. This indicates that aggressive hunting could lead to the depletion of the sheep population, which would ultimately harm the wolf population as well. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep, ensuring a more sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity, and my previous theta of 0.25 was already focused on competition rather than hunting. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to maintain a cautious approach that allows the sheep population to recover while still considering the needs of my pack. A slight increase to 0.30 reflects a balanced strategy that supports coexistence."
