            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 23.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for increased hunting without risking immediate depletion. However, with a wolf population of 89, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting, so a moderate increase to 0.75 allows for sustainable growth while still focusing on competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.7% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking immediate depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 42.96, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. While my previous theta of 0.650 allowed for some hunting, it is important to shift towards a more moderate approach to allow the sheep to recover. This will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is quite high. Focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to recover while preventing overhunting, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover while also keeping the wolf population stable. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover and prevents further depletion of their numbers. This approach also helps ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, as a balanced ecosystem is essential for our future."
