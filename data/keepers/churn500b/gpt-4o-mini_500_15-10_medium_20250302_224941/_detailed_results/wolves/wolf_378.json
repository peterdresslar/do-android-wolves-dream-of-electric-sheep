            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 42.96, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.15 reflects a cautious approach, focusing more on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. A gradual increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance while still allowing for some competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. This lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population, which is essential for the future of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution. Increasing my hunting intensity too much could lead to a collapse of the sheep population, which would ultimately harm the wolf population as well. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.26, and focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to recover. This approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species by preventing further depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.24, which is only a fraction of its maximum capacity. Increasing hunting intensity now could lead to further depletion of sheep, jeopardizing both their recovery and the long-term survival of our wolf pack. Maintaining a lower theta allows for a focus on competition with other wolves while giving sheep a chance to rebound.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.22, and my previous focus on hunting has led to a depletion of their numbers. Maintaining a low theta allows the sheep to recover while I focus on competing with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and ensures the long-term survival of both species."
