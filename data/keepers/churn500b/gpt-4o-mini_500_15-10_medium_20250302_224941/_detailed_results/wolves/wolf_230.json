            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This will help support wolf reproduction while still maintaining a balance that prevents over-depletion of the sheep. A gradual adjustment is key to ensuring both populations can thrive together.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 28.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with a relatively high sheep-to-wolf ratio of 11.42, I need to be cautious not to overhunt, which could lead to a depletion of sheep and ultimately harm the wolf population. A moderate theta allows for continued hunting while also considering the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 27.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 48, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.7% of maximum capacity, indicating that we should focus on allowing them to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. This will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, as well as prevent over-depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help the sheep population stabilize and gradually increase, ensuring long-term survival for both species."
