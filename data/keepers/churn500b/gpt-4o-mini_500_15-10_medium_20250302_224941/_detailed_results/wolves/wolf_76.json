            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 50\n- Sheep population: 8.99\n- Wolf population: 25.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.300\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.36 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 0.9% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low percentage of its maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This approach balances the need for wolf reproduction with the sustainability of the sheep population, ensuring long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively low at 70.82, which is only 7.1% of its maximum capacity. While my previous theta of 0.650 was effective for a time, the current sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for sheep recovery. A theta of 0.55 strikes a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability without risking a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 49.30, which is only 4.9% of its maximum capacity. While my previous theta of 0.550 allowed for some hunting, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.45 strikes a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring that both populations can stabilize and thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 2.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are not enough sheep to sustain intense hunting. By adopting a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to recover while ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.20, which is only 1.9% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure on the sheep while still allowing for some competition among wolves, maintaining a balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low at 0.21. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both species while preventing overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the wolf population is relatively high. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain our numbers without depleting the sheep too quickly. This approach allows for a gradual balance, ensuring both species can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover while also reducing competition among wolves. This approach aligns with my goal of ensuring the long-term survival of both species and avoiding drastic changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. This lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while ensuring that the sheep population has a chance to increase, promoting long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.18, which is only 0.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to be cautious and allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a slight increase in hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A gradual increase to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 9.02, which is only 0.9% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure and give the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, while also allowing the wolf population to stabilize without competing too aggressively with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the wolf population is relatively high. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a bit more hunting to support reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance and avoids overexploitation of the sheep."
