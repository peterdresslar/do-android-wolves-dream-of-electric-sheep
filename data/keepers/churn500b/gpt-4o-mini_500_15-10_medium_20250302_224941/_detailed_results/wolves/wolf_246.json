            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level (23.2% of maximum capacity), and my previous theta was quite low (0.040). To allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a focus on competition with other wolves, a gradual increase to 0.25 will help balance the needs of both populations. This approach supports long-term survival and avoids sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.7% of its maximum capacity, and my previous theta of 0.25 indicates a focus on competition with other wolves. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I will gradually increase my hunting intensity to 0.30, allowing for a slight increase in sheep hunting while still prioritizing the balance needed for recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 42.96, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to sustain itself. A small increase from my previous theta of 0.30 reflects a cautious approach to hunting, balancing the need for food with the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity. Focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to recover while preventing further depletion of their numbers. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and ensuring the long-term survival of both species."
