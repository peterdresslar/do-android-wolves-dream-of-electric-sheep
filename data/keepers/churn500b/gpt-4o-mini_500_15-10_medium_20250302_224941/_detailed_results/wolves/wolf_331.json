            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 42.96, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. While my previous theta of 0.941 indicates a strong focus on hunting, I need to adjust to ensure the sheep can recover. A theta of 0.75 allows for continued hunting to support wolf reproduction while also giving sheep a chance to increase their numbers, promoting a more sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can allow the sheep population to gradually recover while ensuring the long-term survival of both species. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover and increases the chances of sustainable coexistence. Given the current state of the ecosystem, it is crucial to focus on the long-term survival of both species rather than immediate gains.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 0.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating a critical depletion. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover and ensures the long-term survival of both species. As the wolf population is relatively high, focusing on competition rather than hunting will help stabilize our numbers while giving the sheep a chance to rebound."
