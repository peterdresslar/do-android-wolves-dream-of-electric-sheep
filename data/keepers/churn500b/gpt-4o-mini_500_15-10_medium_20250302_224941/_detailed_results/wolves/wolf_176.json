            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.36, which is only 2.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of both populations, ensuring that we do not deplete the sheep further and can maintain a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 0.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a significant competition for resources. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a modest hunting intensity, which can help sustain the wolf population while still giving sheep a chance to recover. This approach balances the immediate need for food with the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to replenish while also managing competition with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and promotes long-term sustainability for both species."
