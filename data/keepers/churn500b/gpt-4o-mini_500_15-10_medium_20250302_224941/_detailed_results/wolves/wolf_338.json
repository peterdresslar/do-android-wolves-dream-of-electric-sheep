            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.7% of its maximum capacity, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balanced approach. This adjustment will help ensure the sheep can recover without depleting their numbers too quickly, allowing for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.5% of its maximum capacity, which indicates a need for recovery. By setting a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves and allow the sheep population to gradually increase, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity. Focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to recover, ensuring a sustainable future for both species. Gradually reducing hunting intensity is essential to prevent further depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help the sheep population rebound while ensuring our own survival in the long term. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem."
