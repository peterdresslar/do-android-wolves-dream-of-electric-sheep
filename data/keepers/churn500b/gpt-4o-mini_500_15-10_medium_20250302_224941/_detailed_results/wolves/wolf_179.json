            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.0% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term survival of both species. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance as the sheep recover, while also considering the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 7.8% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain balance and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 43.14, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a bit more hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.36, which is only 2.4% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.13, which is only 1.5% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a slight hunting intensity to support the wolf population. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.30 to 0.35 reflects a balanced approach that considers the current low sheep numbers and the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a significant imbalance. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can allow the sheep population to recover while ensuring the long-term survival of both species. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a significant imbalance. By reducing my hunting intensity further, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing competition with other wolves. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable ecosystem."
