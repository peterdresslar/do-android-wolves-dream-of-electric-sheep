            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, allowing for some hunting without risking depletion. However, with the wolf population also being significant, a moderate approach will help maintain balance and avoid overexploitation of the sheep. This theta allows for gradual hunting while still considering the need for competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.6% of maximum capacity, which suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow for recovery. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both sheep and wolves while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 70.82, which is only 7.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to stabilize while still competing with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 49.30, which is only 4.9% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.96, which is only 2.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining some hunting to support our wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while being mindful of the need to avoid over-depleting the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 1.3% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.52, which is only 1.2% of its maximum capacity. While I need to focus on hunting to ensure the survival of my pack, I must also be cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep and maintaining a balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a significant competition for resources among wolves. By focusing on competition rather than intense hunting, I can allow the sheep population to recover while ensuring that our wolf pack remains stable. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. A gradual decrease in theta will help maintain a balance while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep."
