            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.7% of its maximum capacity, and my previous theta was quite low at 0.278. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach that encourages sheep recovery while also considering the growing wolf population. This gradual adjustment helps maintain the delicate balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 42.96, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to gradually increase. This approach aligns with the wisdom of ensuring long-term survival and avoiding sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.64, which is 0.2% of its maximum capacity. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover and prevents further depletion. Given the high wolf population, focusing on competition among wolves rather than aggressive hunting is essential for long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can help the sheep population stabilize while allowing the wolf population to adjust. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their extinction. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 0.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating a critical depletion. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover and prevents further decline, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and prioritizes long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.30, which indicates that aggressive hunting could lead to their extinction. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while still competing with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem."
