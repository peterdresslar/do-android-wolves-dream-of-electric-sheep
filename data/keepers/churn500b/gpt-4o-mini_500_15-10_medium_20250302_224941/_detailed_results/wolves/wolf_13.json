            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level (15.0% of maximum capacity), which allows for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking over-depletion. This value strikes a balance between ensuring the wolf population can thrive while still allowing the sheep to recover. It reflects a cautious approach to hunting, considering the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.8% of maximum capacity, indicating that they need some time to recover. A moderate hunting intensity will allow for sustainable coexistence while still enabling the wolf population to thrive. This approach balances the immediate need for food with the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that they need some time to recover. A moderate hunting intensity will allow for sustainable coexistence while still enabling the wolf population to thrive. This approach balances the need for hunting with the necessity of allowing the sheep population to grow.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 70.82, which is only 7.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 strikes a balance between competing with other wolves and allowing the sheep population to stabilize, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 49.30, which is only 4.9% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help maintain a balance and prevent overhunting, which could lead to a crash in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and my previous theta was already on the lower end. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for a modest increase in hunting intensity, which can help sustain my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.96, which is only 2.5% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover while also managing competition with other wolves. A lower theta will help maintain a balance and prevent overhunting, which could lead to a crash in the ecosystem."
