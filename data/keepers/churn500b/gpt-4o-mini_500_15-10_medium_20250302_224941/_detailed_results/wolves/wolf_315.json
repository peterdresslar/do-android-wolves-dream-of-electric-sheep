            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.7% of its maximum capacity, and my previous theta was quite low at 0.037. To allow the sheep to recover while still focusing on competition with other wolves, a moderate increase to 0.25 strikes a balance that supports both populations without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 42.96, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a focus on our own population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.25 will help balance the need for hunting with the necessity of allowing the sheep to rebound, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to replenish their numbers while also preventing overcompetition among wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.64, which is just 0.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that aggressive hunting could lead to the extinction of sheep, jeopardizing the long-term survival of both species. By focusing on competition with other wolves and reducing hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to rebuild their numbers while also managing competition with other wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is zero. Increasing hunting intensity would further threaten the sheep"
