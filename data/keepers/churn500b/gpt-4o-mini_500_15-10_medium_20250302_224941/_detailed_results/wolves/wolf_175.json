            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low percentage of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.36, which is only 2.4% of its maximum capacity. While I need to maintain hunting to support wolf reproduction, I must also be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A moderate increase to 0.70 allows for some hunting while still considering the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, enabling the sheep to recover while still allowing for some hunting to maintain the wolf population. This gradual adjustment helps avoid overexploitation of the sheep and supports long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. This lower theta will help balance the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population, which is essential for our future.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting intensely. This will help balance the populations and avoid depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 6.72, which is only 0.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.30 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need to compete with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. Focusing on competition with other wolves will help stabilize the wolf population while giving sheep a chance to increase.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover.
