            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 28.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 11.42, it is wise to focus on reducing competition among wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover. A gradual increase in theta will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 27.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain the balance between sheep and wolves, allowing for gradual recovery of the sheep population while also supporting the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 23.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 89, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both species can thrive. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that supports wolf reproduction while still considering the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.7% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking their long-term survival. This adjustment supports the wolf population while still being cautious to avoid over-depletion of sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 42.96, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover, and a lower hunting intensity will allow for their population to stabilize. Additionally, with the wolf population at 208, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 4.85, which is just 0.5% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure and give the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, while also acknowledging the current high wolf population."
