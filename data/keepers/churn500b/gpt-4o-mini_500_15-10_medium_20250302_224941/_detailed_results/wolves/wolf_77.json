            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 50\n- Sheep population: 8.99\n- Wolf population: 25.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.350\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.36 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 0.9% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively low at 9.6% of maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for increased hunting intensity without risking immediate depletion. However, with a wolf population of 76, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 70.82, which is only 7.1% of its maximum capacity. While I want to increase hunting to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. A moderate theta of 0.60 allows for some hunting while still considering the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.31, which is only 3.4% of its maximum capacity. While I need to maintain a healthy wolf population, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.45 strikes a balance between hunting and allowing the sheep to increase their numbers, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.96, which is only 2.5% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing competition with other wolves, which is crucial given the current low sheep-to-wolf ratio.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.20, which is only 1.9% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure and give the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, while also allowing the wolf population to stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring both populations can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.3% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a significant competition for resources among wolves. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on reducing competition with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.52, which is only 1.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can grow, while still allowing for some hunting to support wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting sheep. This will allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a healthy balance in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.45, which is only 0.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a slight focus on hunting to support our wolf population. A moderate increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while being mindful of the need for gradual adjustments.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.18, which is only 0.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. Additionally, with a wolf population of 33, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low at 0.28, suggesting that focusing on competition among wolves is more beneficial at this time. A gradual adjustment to 0.30 will help maintain balance and promote sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.02, which is only 0.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.30 to 0.35, I can still maintain a focus on competition with other wolves while allowing for some sustainable hunting. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 8.99, which is only 0.9% of its maximum capacity. With the wolf population at 25.00, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low at 0.36. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash."
