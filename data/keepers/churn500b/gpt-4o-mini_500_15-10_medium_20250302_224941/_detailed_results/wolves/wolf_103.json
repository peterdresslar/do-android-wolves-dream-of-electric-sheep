            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, allowing for some hunting without risking depletion. However, with a relatively high sheep-to-wolf ratio, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both populations can thrive. A moderate adjustment allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual increase in theta aligns with the current trends and avoids sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 16.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. A moderate approach of 0.45 allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while ensuring that the sheep population can recover. This balance helps maintain a sustainable ecosystem without depleting resources too quickly.",

However, with a relatively high sheep-to-wolf ratio, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both populations can thrive in the long term. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover and thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 43.14, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 will help balance the need for wolf survival while giving sheep a chance to increase their numbers, ensuring a sustainable ecosystem.",
