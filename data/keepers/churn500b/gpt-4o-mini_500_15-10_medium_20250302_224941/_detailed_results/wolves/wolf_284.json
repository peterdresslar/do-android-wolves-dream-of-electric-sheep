            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 23.2% of maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 2.61, I need to be cautious not to overhunt, as it could lead to depletion. A moderate increase in hunting intensity allows for reproduction while still considering the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.7% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring both can thrive in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at only 4.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their depletion. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while also giving sheep a chance to recover. This balance is crucial for the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. Focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to recover, ensuring long-term survival for both species. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their extinction. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while still competing with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and ensuring the long-term survival of both species."
