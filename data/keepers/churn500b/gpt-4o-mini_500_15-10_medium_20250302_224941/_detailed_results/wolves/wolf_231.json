            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for increased hunting intensity without risking depletion. This will support wolf reproduction while still maintaining a balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual approach is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly and to adapt to the current dynamics of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep. A gradual approach is essential to ensure long-term survival and stability in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.7% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a potential for sustainable hunting. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, enabling the sheep to recover while still supporting the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 42.96, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also considering the growing wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and allowing the sheep to increase in number, avoiding overhunting."
