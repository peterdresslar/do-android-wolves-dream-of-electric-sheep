            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 49.30, which is only 4.9% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting intensively. This will help balance the populations and prevent a crash in the sheep numbers, while also allowing the wolf population to stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.31, which is only 3.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting to support the wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a cautious approach to hunting, balancing the need for sustenance with the goal of long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 2.5% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. This moderate approach will help maintain a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.3% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A gradual reduction in hunting intensity will help stabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and my previous theta was too focused on hunting. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity, I can help stabilize the sheep population while still allowing for some recovery. This moderate approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity. Maintaining a low hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover and increases their population, which is crucial for the long-term survival of both species. Additionally, with a wolf population of 50, focusing on competition among wolves rather than aggressive hunting will help stabilize our numbers while the sheep have a chance to rebound.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be cautiously increased to support wolf reproduction. However, I must avoid drastic changes to allow the sheep population to recover sustainably. A slight increase to 0.35 reflects a balanced approach to ensure both species can thrive."
