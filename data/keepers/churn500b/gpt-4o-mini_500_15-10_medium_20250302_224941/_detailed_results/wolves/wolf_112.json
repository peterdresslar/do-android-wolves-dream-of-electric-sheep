            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. By keeping the theta value in the moderate range, I can balance the needs of both species and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 15.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, enabling us to maintain our wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting approach that balances the needs of both wolves and sheep. This value reflects a cautious increase in hunting intensity, considering the sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need to avoid depleting the sheep population too quickly. It allows for gradual adjustments as conditions change.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 7.8% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. A lower theta allows for a focus on competition among wolves, which can help stabilize our numbers while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 43.14, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help maintain a balance and prevent overhunting, which could lead to a crash in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.36, which is only 2.4% of its maximum capacity. While I need to focus on hunting to ensure my pack"
