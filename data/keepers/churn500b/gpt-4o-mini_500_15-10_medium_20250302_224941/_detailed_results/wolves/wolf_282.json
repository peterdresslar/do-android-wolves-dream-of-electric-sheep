            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 165\n- Sheep population: 232.38\n- Wolf population: 89.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.100\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 2.61 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 23.2% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 23.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with a relatively high sheep-to-wolf ratio of 2.61, it is prudent to focus on competition among wolves to prevent overhunting and allow the sheep population to recover. A moderate theta will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. A gradual adjustment to 0.25 reflects a cautious approach that prioritizes sustainability."
