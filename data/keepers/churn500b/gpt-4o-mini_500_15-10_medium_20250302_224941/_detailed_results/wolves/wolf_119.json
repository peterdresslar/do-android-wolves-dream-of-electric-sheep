            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are more sheep available relative to wolves. This suggests that I can afford to focus more on competing with other wolves to allow the sheep population to recover. A gradual increase in hunting intensity is warranted as the sheep population grows, but for now, a lower theta will help maintain balance and ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 7.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that they need time to recover. While I want to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must prioritize the long-term survival of both species. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, promoting balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 43.14, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting sheep. This lower theta will help balance the populations and avoid depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.36, which is only 2.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a slight hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.30 to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while being mindful of the long-term sustainability of both species."
