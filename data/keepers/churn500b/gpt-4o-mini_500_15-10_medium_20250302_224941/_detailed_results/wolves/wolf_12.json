By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This approach aligns with my objective of ensuring the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate increase will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. It reflects a balanced approach to ensure both species can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level (13.8% of maximum capacity), allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking over-depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, allowing for some recovery while still maintaining a focus on competition with other wolves. This moderate approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species and avoids depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 70.82, which is only 7.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is potential for recovery if I reduce hunting intensity slightly. By increasing theta from 0.35 to 0.40, I can maintain a balance that allows for some hunting while also giving the sheep a chance to recover, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 49.30, which is only 4.9% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the balance needed for sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.31, which is only 3.4% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting, promoting a healthier balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.96, which is only 2.5% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover.
