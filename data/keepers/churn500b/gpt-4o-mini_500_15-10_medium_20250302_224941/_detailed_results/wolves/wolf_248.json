        "explanations": [
            "I chose this theta because it represents a balanced approach to hunting and competition. With the sheep population at a sustainable level and the wolf population still relatively low, a moderate increase in hunting intensity will help support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover gradually. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level (14.7% of maximum capacity), which suggests that a more moderate hunting intensity is appropriate to allow for recovery. While the wolf population is slightly higher than the sheep population, I want to avoid depleting the sheep further. A theta of 0.45 strikes a balance between hunting and allowing the sheep to rebound, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 42.96, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting. This lower theta will help balance the populations and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity and give the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, while also managing the wolf population sustainably."
