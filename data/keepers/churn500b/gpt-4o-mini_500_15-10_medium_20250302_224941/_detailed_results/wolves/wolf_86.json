            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 53\n- Sheep population: 9.59\n- Wolf population: 17.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.300\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.56 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 1.0% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I need to maintain a focus on hunting to support the wolf population, I must also be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A slight reduction from my previous theta allows for continued hunting while promoting a more sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is quite low at 3.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that we need to be cautious with our hunting to allow the sheep to recover. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.37, there is still a need for some hunting to support our wolf population. A moderate increase to 0.70 allows for sustainable hunting while still focusing on the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 2.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that a more moderate hunting intensity is necessary to allow the sheep to recover. While my previous theta was higher, the current sheep-to-wolf ratio suggests that focusing on competition with other wolves will help maintain a balance and ensure the long-term survival of both species. Gradually adjusting to a lower theta will support sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can allow the sheep to replenish while maintaining a stable wolf population. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.52, which is only 1.2% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will enable me to hunt a bit more while still prioritizing the sustainability of both populations. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to replenish their numbers while also managing competition with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep population while still allowing for some competition among wolves. A lower theta will help the sheep recover and create a more sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.45, which is only 0.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are struggling, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to their depletion. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is quite low at 9.18, which is only 0.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should be cautious with our hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach, enabling some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 9.02, which is only 0.9% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure and give the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, while also allowing our wolf population to stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is quite low at 8.99, which is only 0.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should remain low to allow the sheep to recover. However, since the wolf population is relatively high at 25.00, a slight increase in theta to 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the sustainability of both populations. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.09, which is only 0.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are under significant pressure, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to their depletion. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to recover while ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.59, which is only 1.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.30 to 0.35, I can maintain a balance that supports both the wolf population and the sheep"
