            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.7% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a potential for overhunting if I increase my hunting intensity too much. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while also giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring a sustainable balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 42.96, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover rather than intensifying hunting. A moderate theta value of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and allowing the sheep population to stabilize, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating a severe depletion of resources. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. A gradual decrease in theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.26, indicating that aggressive hunting would further deplete their numbers and threaten long-term survival. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep population a chance to recover while maintaining a sustainable wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.24, which means aggressive hunting would further deplete their numbers and threaten long-term survival. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This balance will help ensure both wolves and sheep can coexist sustainably."
