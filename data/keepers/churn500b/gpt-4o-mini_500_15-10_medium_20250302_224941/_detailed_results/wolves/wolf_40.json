            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.8% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This balance will help sustain both the wolf and sheep populations while allowing for gradual adjustments as conditions change.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports both wolf reproduction and sheep recovery. This balance helps maintain the ecosystem without depleting the sheep too quickly, while also considering the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.6% of maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution in hunting. By lowering the theta slightly, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to recover while maintaining a healthy balance in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 70.82, which is only 7.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain our population while allowing the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring our long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 49.30, which is only 4.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own wolf population. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and prevent over-depletion of the sheep, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.31, which is only 3.4% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.20, which is only 1.9% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a significant scarcity of prey. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for long-term sustainability."
