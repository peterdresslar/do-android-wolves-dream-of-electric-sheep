            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level (12.0% of maximum capacity), allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking immediate depletion. This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing sheep to recover over time. A gradual approach is essential to maintain balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 43.14, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.60 allows for some hunting to support reproduction while not depleting the sheep further. This balance is crucial for long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.36, which is only 2.4% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.40 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. A gradual decrease in theta will help maintain balance without causing sudden population crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their collapse. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population a chance to recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a high level of competition among wolves. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help sustain my pack while allowing the sheep population to recover gradually. This approach aligns with the wisdom of making small adjustments to maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to bounce back.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover while preventing overcompetition among wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and ensures the long-term survival of both species."
