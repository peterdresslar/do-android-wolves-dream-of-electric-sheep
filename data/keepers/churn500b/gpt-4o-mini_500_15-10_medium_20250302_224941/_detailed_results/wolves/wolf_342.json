            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.7% of its maximum capacity, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 42.96, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a slight increase in hunting compared to my previous value, acknowledging the need for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity. Focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to recover while ensuring that our wolf population does not deplete too quickly. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity. Increasing hunting intensity could lead to further depletion of the sheep, jeopardizing the long-term survival of both species. A moderate theta allows for a focus on competition with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 0.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating a critical depletion. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows for the potential recovery of the sheep population while avoiding competition with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and prioritizes long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.30, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is at 0.00. Focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep population to recover, ensuring long-term survival for both species. A gradual reduction in hunting intensity is necessary to prevent further depletion of the sheep."
