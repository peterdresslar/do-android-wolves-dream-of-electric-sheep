            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain the balance between wolf and sheep populations while avoiding over-depletion of the sheep. A gradual adjustment is essential to ensure both populations can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.6% of maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are more sheep available for hunting. However, I want to avoid overhunting and ensure the long-term survival of both species. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while still considering the need for sheep recovery and the health of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 70.82, which is only 7.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize while ensuring our own numbers do not decline too rapidly. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 49.30, which is only 4.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain our wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.96, which is only 2.5% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 to 0.35 reflects a balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to support reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.3% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a significant scarcity of prey. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing competition among wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for a sustainable balance."
