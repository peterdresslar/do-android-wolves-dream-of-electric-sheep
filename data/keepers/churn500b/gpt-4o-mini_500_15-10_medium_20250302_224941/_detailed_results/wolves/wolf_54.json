            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.0% of its maximum capacity, which suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to increase. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are more sheep available per wolf. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing competition among wolves. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of my ancestors, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 70.82, which is only 7.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.30 to 0.35, I can still maintain some hunting activity while prioritizing the long-term balance and survival of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 49.30, which is only 4.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.31, which is only 3.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain its health. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a cautious approach to hunting, balancing the need for sustenance with the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.96, which is only 2.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.30 maintains a focus on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, promoting a gradual balance that supports both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.20, which is only 1.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a slight hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.30 to 0.35 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for sustainable coexistence without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help the sheep population stabilize and grow, which will ultimately benefit the wolf population in the long run. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while avoiding overcompetition among wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and ensures the long-term survival of both species."
