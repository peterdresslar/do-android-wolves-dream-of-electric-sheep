            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 42.96, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on a more balanced approach. A theta of 0.4 allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while also giving sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment helps maintain a sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. Focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to recover, ensuring a sustainable future for both species. A gradual reduction in hunting intensity is necessary to prevent further depletion of the sheep population.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity. Increasing hunting intensity could lead to the depletion of sheep, jeopardizing both their survival and our long-term food source. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity. Maintaining a low hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover and helps ensure the long-term survival of both species. Given the current dynamics, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 0.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating a critical depletion. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows for the possibility of sheep recovery while also addressing the competition among wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for long-term sustainability."
