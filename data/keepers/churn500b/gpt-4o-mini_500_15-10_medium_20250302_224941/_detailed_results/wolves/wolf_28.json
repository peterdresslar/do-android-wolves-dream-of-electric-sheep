            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a healthy number of sheep relative to wolves. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, enabling the sheep to recover while still allowing for some hunting to support the wolf population. This gradual adjustment helps maintain sustainability in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, allowing for some hunting without risking depletion. However, with the wolf population also being relatively stable, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.6% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help sustain both populations while responding to the current ecosystem state.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 70.82, which is only 7.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting a lower theta, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 49.30, which is only 4.9% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.96, which is only 2.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be cautiously increased to allow for some recovery of the sheep while still focusing on the competition among wolves. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach, promoting sustainability without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.20, which is only 1.9% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and my previous theta was already on the lower end. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach to hunting while still prioritizing competition with other wolves. This adjustment helps ensure that both sheep and wolves can recover sustainably without risking a crash in either population."
