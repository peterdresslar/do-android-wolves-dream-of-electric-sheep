            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 24.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for increased hunting without risking immediate depletion. However, since the wolf population is low, I want to avoid over-hunting and maintain a balance that allows for sustainable coexistence. A slight increase to 0.7 allows for more hunting while still being cautious.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 26.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with a relatively small wolf population of 7, it is important to maintain a balance that allows for both hunting and competition among wolves. A moderate theta of 0.60 will enable me to hunt effectively while still allowing the sheep population to recover and ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting approach. This will help maintain a balance between the wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term survival for both. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while still supporting the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while still ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment will help maintain balance without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This balance helps maintain both populations without risking depletion or overcompetition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 42.96, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still competing with other wolves. A moderate theta value of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to increase."
