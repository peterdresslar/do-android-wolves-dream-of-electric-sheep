            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.0% of its maximum capacity, and my previous theta was quite low at 0.072. To allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining some hunting intensity, I will gradually increase my theta to 0.15. This approach balances the need for wolf reproduction with the sustainability of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level (17.4% of maximum capacity), and my previous theta was quite low at 0.150. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a presence in the ecosystem. A gradual increase to 0.25 allows for some hunting without over-depleting the sheep population, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 7.8% of maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of sustaining both populations over time.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 43.14, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is a need for cautious hunting to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a slight increase in hunting intensity to support the wolf population. A small adjustment from my previous theta of 0.30 to 0.35 reflects a balanced approach, promoting coexistence and sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.36, which is only 2.4% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to recover. This approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species while maintaining a healthy wolf population."
