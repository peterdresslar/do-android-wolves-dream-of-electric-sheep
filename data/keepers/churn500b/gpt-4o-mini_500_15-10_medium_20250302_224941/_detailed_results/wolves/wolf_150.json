            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 120.10, which is only 12.0% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking immediate depletion of the sheep. A theta of 0.75 strikes a balance between ensuring our wolf population can thrive while still allowing the sheep to recover over time.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 43.14, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. While I need to maintain a balance to ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, a moderate increase in hunting intensity is warranted to take advantage of the current sheep population without depleting it too quickly. This adjustment allows for sustainable coexistence while also considering the growth of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.36, which is only 2.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.40 strikes a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep can rebound, promoting long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can allow the sheep population to stabilize and gradually increase, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 0.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable for hunting. By reducing my hunting intensity further, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing competition with other wolves. This gradual adjustment will help ensure the long-term survival of both species."
