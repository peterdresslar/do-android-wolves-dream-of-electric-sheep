            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 42.96, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. While my previous theta of 0.933 indicates a strong hunting approach, I need to reduce hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. A theta of 0.75 strikes a balance between hunting enough to sustain my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity. Maintaining a low hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover and increases the chances of sustainable coexistence in the long term. Given the current wolf population is high, focusing on competition rather than hunting will help balance the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.30, which means aggressive hunting would further deplete their numbers and jeopardize the long-term survival of both species. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover. This gradual adjustment is essential for maintaining a sustainable ecosystem."
