            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level (12.0% of maximum capacity), allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain our wolf population while still giving the sheep a chance to recover. A theta of 0.75 strikes a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting a healthy ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 7.8% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help sustain both the wolf and sheep populations while responding to the current trends.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 43.14, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also considering the growing wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.40 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.36, which is only 2.4% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure my own survival and that of my pack, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to rebound.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting. This lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and give the sheep a chance to rebound."
