            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 42.96, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.4 allows for some hunting without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their extinction. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep population to recover while ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover and helps ensure the long-term survival of both species. Given the current state of the ecosystem, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 0.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating a critical depletion. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover, which is essential for the long-term survival of both species. Given the current wolf population is relatively high, it is prudent to focus on competition among wolves rather than aggressive hunting."
