            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 7.1% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover. A gradual increase in theta will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.31, which is only 3.4% of its maximum capacity. Given the high wolf population of 94, it is crucial to focus on competition among wolves rather than intensifying hunting. This will allow the sheep population to recover while ensuring the long-term survival of both species. A gradual approach will help maintain balance without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution in hunting. While I want to ensure the survival of my pack, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term balance of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to recover. This approach aligns with the need for long-term sustainability and avoids depleting the sheep further, ensuring both populations can thrive in the future.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. A gradual adjustment will help maintain balance without causing drastic changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.45, which is only 0.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. Given the current wolf population of 38, a theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to support our population without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.18, which is only 0.9% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the survival of my pack, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will help me maintain a balance between hunting and allowing the sheep population to stabilize, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.09, which is only 0.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.28, which is only 0.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are struggling, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.30 to 0.35, I can still maintain some hunting activity while prioritizing the long-term survival of both species. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance."
