            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 42.96, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. While I need to maintain a focus on hunting to support the wolf population, I must also be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A moderate increase in hunting intensity allows for some reproduction while still considering the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their extinction. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep population to recover while ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity. Focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to recover without further depleting their numbers. A gradual approach is necessary to ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 0.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating a critical depletion. To allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a focus on competition with other wolves, a lower theta value is appropriate. This will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent further decline in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.22, and focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to recover. By reducing hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species and maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.21, which means aggressive hunting would further deplete their numbers and threaten long-term survival. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, promoting a gradual recovery of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.21, which is only a fraction of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent further depletion of the sheep, while also allowing the wolf population to adapt to the changing conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and my previous theta was too focused on hunting. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity, I can help stabilize the sheep population while still allowing for some recovery. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a balance between the wolf and sheep populations."
