            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate hunting approach. This will help maintain the balance between wolves and sheep while avoiding overexploitation. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio, a slight reduction in hunting intensity will support the long-term survival of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.7% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are nearly equal numbers of sheep and wolves. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help sustain the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover gradually. This moderate adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity. Focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to recover, ensuring a sustainable future for both species. A gradual approach is necessary to avoid depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance."
