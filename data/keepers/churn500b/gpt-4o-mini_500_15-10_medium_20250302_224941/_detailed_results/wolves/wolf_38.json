            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.0% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help sustain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level (13.8% of maximum capacity), allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking immediate depletion. This adjustment will help sustain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover over time.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that can support wolf reproduction while preventing over-depletion of the sheep. This balance will help maintain both populations in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that they need time to recover. A moderate hunting intensity allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling the wolf population to thrive. This approach balances the immediate need for food with the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 70.82, which is only 7.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a moderate approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.31, which is only 3.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover, and focusing more on competition with other wolves will allow for a more sustainable environment. By keeping the hunting intensity lower, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both the sheep and the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.20, which is only 1.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should be cautious with our hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for wolves to sustain themselves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.3% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population, which is crucial for the sustainability of our pack."
