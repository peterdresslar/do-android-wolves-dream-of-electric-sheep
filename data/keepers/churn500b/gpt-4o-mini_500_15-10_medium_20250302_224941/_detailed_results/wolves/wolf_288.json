            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively low at 23.2% of maximum capacity, allowing for a cautious increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 89, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low relative to the maximum capacity, and the wolf population is slightly higher than the sheep population. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while still competing with other wolves. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.64, which is just 0.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population, which is essential for the future of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their extinction. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population a chance to recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and sustainable coexistence."
