            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.7% of its maximum capacity, and my previous theta was very low at 0.019. To allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining some hunting, I will gradually increase my hunting intensity to 0.25. This approach balances the need for wolf survival with the sustainability of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 42.96, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a focus on our own competition with other wolves. A slight increase from my previous theta will help balance the need for hunting with the necessity of sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity. Increasing hunting intensity could lead to the extinction of sheep, which would ultimately harm the wolf population as well. Maintaining a lower theta allows for the potential recovery of the sheep population while ensuring that the wolf pack does not overextend itself in competition.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 0.0% of maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery. Maintaining a lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, as it allows the sheep population to stabilize before we increase our hunting efforts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.30, which means aggressive hunting would further deplete their numbers and threaten long-term survival. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing competition with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
