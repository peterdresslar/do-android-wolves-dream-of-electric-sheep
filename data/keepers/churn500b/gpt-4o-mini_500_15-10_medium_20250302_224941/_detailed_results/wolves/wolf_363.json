            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.7% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are nearly as many wolves as sheep. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will allow for some reproduction among wolves while still giving sheep a chance to recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 42.96, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By adopting a lower theta, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes that could lead to crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can allow the sheep population to stabilize and gradually increase, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting sheep. This will allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a healthy balance among the wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while allowing the ecosystem to stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.26, and my previous theta of 0.200 was already focused on competition rather than hunting. To allow the sheep population to recover while still maintaining a presence in the ecosystem, I will make a small adjustment to 0.25. This will help ensure that I do not over-deplete the sheep while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.24, which is only a fraction of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure and give the sheep a chance to rebound, while also allowing for some competition among wolves without drastically reducing our numbers."
