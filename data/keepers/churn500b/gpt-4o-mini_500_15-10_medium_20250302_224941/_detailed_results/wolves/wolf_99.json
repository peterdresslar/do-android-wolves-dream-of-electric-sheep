This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can continue to thrive. A gradual adjustment is key to avoiding sudden population crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while I want to increase hunting to support wolf reproduction, I must also consider the long-term health of the sheep population. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring that both populations can thrive without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight reduction in hunting intensity. This will help maintain the sheep population while also allowing for some competition among wolves, which is necessary for our long-term survival. A gradual adjustment will support a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment reflects a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while ensuring that the sheep population can recover and thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low percentage of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both species. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance as the sheep population recovers, while also considering the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover gradually.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 7.8% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves to allow the sheep population to recover. A gradual decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain balance without risking a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 43.14, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain a balance and prevent overhunting."
