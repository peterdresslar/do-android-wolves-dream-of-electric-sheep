            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 7.8% of maximum capacity, indicating that they need time to recover. A moderate hunting intensity will allow for some reproduction among wolves while giving sheep a chance to bounce back. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 43.14, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.36, which is only 2.4% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting sheep. This lower theta will allow the sheep population to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting sheep. This will allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a healthy balance in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 0.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable for hunting. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to recover while ensuring the long-term survival of both species. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of adapting to changing conditions without causing sudden fluctuations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a significant competition for resources among wolves. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a bit more hunting to support reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By focusing more on competing with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we are at risk of depleting their numbers further. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover.

This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. A moderate theta will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and allowing the sheep to increase in number, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species."
