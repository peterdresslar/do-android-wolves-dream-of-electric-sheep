This indicates that the sheep need time to recover, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to replenish. Additionally, with a wolf population of 208, focusing on competition among wolves rather than intense hunting will help maintain our numbers while supporting the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a collapse.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.1% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a severe depletion of prey. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing competition with other wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of sustainable coexistence and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.30, which means aggressive hunting could lead to their extinction. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing the competition with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.26, which indicates that aggressive hunting would further deplete their numbers and jeopardize the long-term survival of both species. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.22, which means aggressive hunting would further deplete their numbers and jeopardize the long-term survival of both species. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.21, and my previous theta of 0.200 was too focused on competition with other wolves. A slight increase to 0.25 allows for a more balanced approach, enabling some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep further. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable ecosystem.",

This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and my previous theta was too focused on hunting. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity, I can help the sheep population recover while still being mindful of the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.21, which is only 0.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.30 reflects a cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.22, which is only 0.0% of its maximum capacity. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover without further depleting their numbers. This approach also helps stabilize the wolf population as we avoid overhunting during this vulnerable time."
