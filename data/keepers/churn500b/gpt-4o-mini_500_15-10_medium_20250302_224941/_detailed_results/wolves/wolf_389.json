To allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a focus on competition with other wolves, a gradual increase in theta is necessary. This will help balance the need for hunting with the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their extinction. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can allow the sheep population to gradually recover while ensuring the long-term survival of both species. This approach aligns with the wisdom of making small adjustments and maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 0.0% of maximum capacity, indicating a critical depletion. By setting theta at 0.30, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population a chance to recover while maintaining a stable wolf population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of avoiding sudden changes and promotes long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.30, indicating that aggressive hunting would further deplete their numbers and jeopardize the long-term survival of both species. Maintaining a low theta allows for the potential recovery of the sheep population while we focus on competing with other wolves, ensuring a more sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.26, which is only a fraction of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help create a more sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.24, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their extinction. Maintaining a low theta allows for the potential recovery of the sheep population while ensuring the wolf pack does not overextend itself in competition. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.22, which indicates that aggressive hunting would further deplete their numbers and jeopardize the long-term survival of both species. Maintaining a low theta allows for the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves, ensuring a more sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.21, indicating that aggressive hunting would further deplete their numbers and jeopardize the long-term survival of both species. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population.
