            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.4% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a significant number of sheep per wolf. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing competition among wolves. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 120.10, which is only 12.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is an opportunity to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A moderate increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.36, which is only 2.4% of its maximum capacity. A lower theta allows for a focus on competing with other wolves, which can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we are at risk of depleting the sheep further if we increase our hunting intensity. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species."
