            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. Focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to recover, ensuring a sustainable future for both species. A gradual reduction in hunting intensity is necessary to prevent further depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. This lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is 0.00. This indicates that aggressive hunting could lead to the extinction of sheep, which would ultimately harm the wolf population as well. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 0.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating a critical depletion. To allow for recovery and ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and competing with other wolves. This lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and give sheep a chance to rebound."
