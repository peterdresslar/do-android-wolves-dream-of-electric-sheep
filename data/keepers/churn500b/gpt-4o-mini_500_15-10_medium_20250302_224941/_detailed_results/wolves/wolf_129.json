            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is relatively high at 5.81. This suggests that while there is an opportunity for hunting, it is crucial to prioritize the long-term health of both populations. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while also enabling the sheep to recover, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term survival while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 43.14, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a moderate approach, balancing the need to compete with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 15.13, which is only 1.5% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure and give the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, while also allowing the wolf population to stabilize without competing too aggressively.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. A gradual decrease in theta will help maintain balance without causing sudden population crashes."
