            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently healthy at 285.48, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring both populations can thrive together.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.7% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are nearly equal numbers of sheep and wolves. A moderate hunting intensity will allow for some replenishment of the sheep population while still enabling the wolf population to thrive. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at only 4.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while maintaining a healthy wolf population."
