            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.36, which is only 2.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.32 reflects a cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help balance competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to increase their numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover while maintaining a sustainable wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta will help balance the need for hunting with the necessity of allowing sheep to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.7% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low at 0.09. This indicates that hunting intensity should be cautiously increased to allow for some recovery of the sheep population while still focusing on maintaining a healthy wolf population. A small increase to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep further."
