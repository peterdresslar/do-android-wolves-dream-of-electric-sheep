            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are more sheep available per wolf. This suggests that I should focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover while still competing with other wolves. A gradual increase in theta will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the wolf population is relatively high. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. This approach supports long-term sustainability and avoids depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 49.30, which is only 4.9% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.31, which is only 3.4% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.96, which is only 2.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are in a vulnerable state, and while I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must prioritize the recovery of the sheep. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.9% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain balance and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a slight hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.30 to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.3% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a significant scarcity of prey. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.52, which is only 1.2% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will help me maintain a balance between hunting and allowing the sheep to grow, avoiding overexploitation while still supporting my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.18, which is only 0.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderate to allow the sheep to recover while still ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for some hunting without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.02, which is only 0.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are under significant pressure. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to recover while ensuring our own numbers do not decline too rapidly. This approach promotes a sustainable balance in the ecosystem."
