            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for moderate hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. This value balances the need for wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover and thrive. It reflects a cautious approach as the wolf population is relatively small compared to the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but I need to be cautious as the wolf population is relatively low. A moderate hunting intensity will allow for some sheep population growth while also ensuring that my pack can thrive without overexploiting the resource.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 12.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 86, I need to be cautious about overhunting. A slight decrease in hunting intensity allows for a sustainable balance, promoting both sheep recovery and wolf population stability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 7.8% of its maximum capacity, which suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from the previous theta of 0.40 to 0.35, I can maintain a balance that supports both the wolf population and the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.36, which is only 2.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem."
