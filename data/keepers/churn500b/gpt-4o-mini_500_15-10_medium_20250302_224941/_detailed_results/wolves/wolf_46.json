            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual adjustment is necessary to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level (12.0% of maximum capacity), allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. A moderate increase to 0.55 balances the need for wolf reproduction with the sustainability of the sheep population, ensuring both can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 49.30, which is only 4.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.45 strikes a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability while still allowing for some hunting to support our pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.20, which is only 1.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 represents a moderate approach, balancing the need to compete with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep to recover. This lower theta will help maintain a balance while preventing the depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.52, which is only 1.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow for sheep recovery while also considering the growing wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a cautious approach to hunting, promoting sustainability without risking a crash in the sheep population."
