            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 182\n- Sheep population: 0.22\n- Wolf population: 22.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.300\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.01 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 0.0% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can help create a more sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help the sheep population stabilize and gradually increase, ensuring long-term survival for both species. This approach aligns with the wisdom of making small adjustments and maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta will help balance the need for hunting with the necessity of allowing the sheep to rebound.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity. Maintaining a low hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover and prevent further depletion, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem. Given the current wolf population is high, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 0.0% of maximum capacity, indicating a critical depletion. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows for the potential recovery of the sheep population while also considering the growing wolf population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.30, which indicates that aggressive hunting would further deplete their numbers and threaten the ecosystem. By focusing on competition with other wolves at a lower theta, I can allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining the wolf population in a sustainable manner.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.26, which is only a fraction of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.24, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a severe depletion of prey. Maintaining a low hunting intensity allows the sheep population a chance to recover, ensuring long-term survival for both wolves and sheep. Gradual adjustments are essential to avoid destabilizing the ecosystem further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.22, which means aggressive hunting could lead to their extinction. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This way, I can ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.21, which means aggressive hunting could lead to their extinction. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while still competing with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.21, which is only 0.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that aggressive hunting could lead to the extinction of sheep, jeopardizing the long-term survival of both species. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and my previous theta was focused on hunting intensity. To allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a presence in the ecosystem, I will adopt a more balanced approach. This will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.22, which is only 0.0% of its maximum capacity. Focusing on competition with other wolves at this lower intensity allows the sheep to recover without further depleting their numbers. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both species."
