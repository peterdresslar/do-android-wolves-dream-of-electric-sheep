            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 7.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for gradual hunting without risking depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 43.14, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting intensively. This will help balance the populations and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.36, which is only 2.4% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will enable me to hunt a bit more while still prioritizing the sustainability of both species. This moderate adjustment reflects the need for balance as the ecosystem is fragile.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure their long-term survival, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting. This will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a significant competition for resources among wolves. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help sustain my pack while allowing the sheep population to recover gradually. This approach aligns with the wisdom of making small adjustments to maintain balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 0.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. Additionally, with a high wolf population, focusing on competition among wolves is necessary to maintain balance and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help balance the ecosystem and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to replenish while also managing competition with other wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.4% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. A gradual decrease in hunting will help maintain a balance while avoiding a crash in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 4.22, which is only 0.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are struggling, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to their depletion. By maintaining a moderate theta of 0.30, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover, ensuring long-term survival for both species."
