            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while still enabling the sheep to recover. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance and avoid over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and while it is important to maintain a healthy wolf population, I need to allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help ensure that the sheep can rebound while still allowing for some hunting to support wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 7.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that a more cautious approach is needed to allow for recovery. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from the previous theta, I can still support wolf reproduction while ensuring that the sheep population has the opportunity to grow. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.36, which is only 2.4% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a modest increase in hunting intensity, which can help sustain my pack while still giving the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. This lower theta will help create a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 0.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both species by preventing overhunting and allowing for a sustainable balance."
