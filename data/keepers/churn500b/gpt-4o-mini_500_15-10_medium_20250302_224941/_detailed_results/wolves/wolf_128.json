            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.0% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring both can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 15.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of gradual changes and the need to balance both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, allowing for some hunting without risking depletion. However, with the wolf population also present, a moderate approach is necessary to ensure both species can thrive. This theta allows for a balanced strategy that supports sustainable coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 43.14, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing competition with other wolves, which will help stabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 2.4% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and promote sustainable cycles.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and I need to focus on allowing them to recover while still ensuring my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. Focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep population to recover, ensuring a sustainable future for both species. A gradual reduction in hunting intensity is necessary to avoid further depletion of the sheep."
