            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 70.82, which is only 7.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that the sheep need time to recover, and focusing more on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to stabilize. A gradual increase in theta will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 49.30, which is only 4.9% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will enable me to maintain some hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 1.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help the sheep population stabilize while also managing competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.52, which is only 1.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring both populations can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their depletion. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.45, which is only 0.9% of its maximum capacity. While I need to be cautious about overhunting, a slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a bit more hunting intensity to help sustain the wolf population. This adjustment is small and considers the need for balance, ensuring that both sheep and wolves can thrive in the long term."
