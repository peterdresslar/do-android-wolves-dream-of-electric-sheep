            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while it is beneficial to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must also be cautious not to deplete the sheep too quickly. A moderate approach allows for coexistence while still enabling growth in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 7.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that they need time to recover. With a wolf population of 110, it's wise to focus on competition among wolves rather than intense hunting, allowing for a sustainable balance. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting while still prioritizing the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 43.14, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure long-term sustainability, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensifying hunting. This will help balance the ecosystem and prevent a crash in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.36, which is only 2.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to be cautious and allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a slight hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A small increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity and give the sheep a chance to rebound, while also managing competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 0.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable for hunting. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover. This gradual approach will promote long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 6.72, which is only 0.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.30 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need to compete with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population."
