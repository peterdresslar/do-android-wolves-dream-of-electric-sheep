            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 42.96, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover, I need to focus on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting. A gradual increase in theta will help maintain a balance while ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that aggressive hunting could lead to a further decline in sheep, jeopardizing the long-term survival of both species. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population a chance to recover. This balanced approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By focusing more on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help the sheep population stabilize and gradually increase. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their extinction. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 0.0% of maximum capacity, indicating a critical depletion. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and prioritizes long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.30, and focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to recover. A lower hunting intensity is necessary to ensure the long-term survival of both species, as depleting the sheep further could lead to a collapse of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.26, and my previous theta of 0.200 was already focused on competition rather than hunting. To allow the sheep to recover, I need to maintain a low hunting intensity while still being mindful of the wolf population. A slight increase to 0.25 allows for a small adjustment that can help balance the ecosystem without overwhelming the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.24, which is only a fraction of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash in both populations."
