            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 49.30, which is only 4.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to increase. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid sudden impacts on both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.31, which is only 3.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.30 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need to compete with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to sustain our population without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.96, which is only 2.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should be cautious with our hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for some hunting while still prioritizing the sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.20, which is only 1.9% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure and give the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, while also managing competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, which indicates a need for recovery. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help the sheep population rebound while ensuring our own survival in the long term. This gradual adjustment allows for a more sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to replenish while also managing competition with other wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of sustainable coexistence and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta will help balance the need for sustenance while still considering the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 9.02, which is only 0.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are struggling, and if I increase my hunting intensity, it could lead to their depletion and ultimately harm the wolf population as well. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we are competing for limited resources. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a bit more hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance without risking a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.09, which is only 0.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are under significant pressure, and focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep population to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while allowing the ecosystem to stabilize.",
