            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.6% of maximum capacity, indicating that a more moderate hunting approach will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to thrive. This value balances the need for hunting with the necessity of maintaining a sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 49.30, which is only 4.9% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach that balances competition with other wolves and allows for some hunting without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low at 0.21. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves, which will help stabilize our population while giving the sheep a chance to bounce back.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.3% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A gradual reduction in hunting intensity will help stabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.52, which is only 1.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population. A gradual decrease in hunting will help stabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.45, which is only 0.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. By increasing theta slightly from my previous value, I can still maintain some hunting activity while prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.18, which is only 0.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are struggling, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to recover. However, with a wolf population of 33, I need to ensure that we do not compete too fiercely with each other, so a slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will help maintain a balance while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 8.99, which is only 0.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are in a vulnerable state, and focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while allowing the sheep population to stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.09, which is only 0.9% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the survival of my pack, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will help maintain a balance between hunting and allowing the sheep population to stabilize, preventing a crash in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting sheep. This will allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a balance within the wolf pack."
