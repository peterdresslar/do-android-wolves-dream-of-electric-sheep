            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without risking depletion. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, allowing for gradual recovery while ensuring our pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 49.30, which is only 4.9% of its maximum capacity. While I need to maintain a healthy wolf population, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to gradually increase. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.2% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. This lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we are overhunting. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.18, which is only 0.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are under pressure and need time to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize.
