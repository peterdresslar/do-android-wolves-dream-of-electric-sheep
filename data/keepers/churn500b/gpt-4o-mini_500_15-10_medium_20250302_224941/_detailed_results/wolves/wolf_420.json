            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 187\n- Sheep population: 0.30\n- Wolf population: 10.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.250\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.03 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 0.0% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 42.96, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. This balance will help sustain the ecosystem without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.1% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover while preventing overcompetition among wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and prioritizes long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover rather than intensifying hunting. A lower theta will help reduce competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to bounce back.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 0.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating a critical depletion. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep population. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep to gradually recover, thus fostering a more sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and my previous theta was too focused on hunting. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity, I can help the sheep population recover while still being mindful of the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.26, which means aggressive hunting would further deplete their numbers and threaten long-term survival. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.22, and my previous theta of 0.200 was too focused on competition with other wolves. A slight increase to 0.25 allows for a more balanced approach, enabling some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.21, which means aggressive hunting would further deplete their numbers and threaten long-term survival. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also competing with other wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.21, which is only 0.0% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.20 will help me compete with other wolves while still being mindful of the need for sheep to rebound. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.28, which is only 0.0% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will reduce hunting intensity and help stabilize the ecosystem, giving sheep a chance to rebound while still allowing for some competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.30, which is only 0.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are in a vulnerable state, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to their depletion. By setting theta at 0.30, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover, ensuring a more sustainable balance in the ecosystem."
