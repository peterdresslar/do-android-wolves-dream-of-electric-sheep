            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 7.8% of its maximum capacity, and my previous theta was very low at 0.005. To allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining some hunting activity, I will gradually increase my hunting intensity to 0.15. This approach balances the need for wolf reproduction with the necessity of allowing the sheep population to stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 43.14, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. Given the high wolf population of 123, I need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our own population. A gradual increase in theta will help balance our needs without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.36, which is only 2.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderate to allow the sheep to recover while still ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. A gradual increase in theta will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 0.8% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting sheep. This lower theta will help balance the populations over time.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.7% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. This suggests that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. A moderate theta of 0.30 will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and allowing the sheep to increase in number, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 0.6% of its maximum capacity. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover while also reducing competition among wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and ensures the long-term survival of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.5% of its maximum capacity, which indicates that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery. Maintaining a theta of 0.30 will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, as it focuses on competition with other wolves rather than depleting the already scarce sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and my previous theta was already on the lower end. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for a modest increase in hunting intensity, which can help sustain my pack without depleting the sheep population too quickly. This adjustment aligns with the need for a balanced approach, considering both the current low sheep numbers and the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.4% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity and give the sheep a chance to rebound, while also managing competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we need to be cautious with our hunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support our population while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep. This balanced approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.4% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are not enough sheep to sustain aggressive hunting. By maintaining a lower theta, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing competition with other wolves. This approach supports long-term coexistence and prevents potential crashes in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a bit more hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This moderate approach helps maintain balance in the ecosystem."
