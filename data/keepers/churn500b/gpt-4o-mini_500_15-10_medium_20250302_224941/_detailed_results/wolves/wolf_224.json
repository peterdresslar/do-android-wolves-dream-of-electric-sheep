            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 24.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with only 4 wolves, I need to be cautious not to overhunt and deplete the sheep population too quickly. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance while allowing for the wolf population to grow.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while maintaining a balance that prevents overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that can support both wolf reproduction and sheep recovery. This balance helps avoid over-depletion of the sheep while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, at only 14.7% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are nearly as many wolves as sheep. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensifying hunting. This will allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a healthy balance in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. This lower theta will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population, which is essential for the sustainability of my pack."
