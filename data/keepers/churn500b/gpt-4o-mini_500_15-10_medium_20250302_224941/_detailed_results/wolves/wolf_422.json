            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 168\n- Sheep population: 4.85\n- Wolf population: 206.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.285\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.02 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 0.5% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while still competing with other wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their extinction. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a sustainable wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity. Increasing hunting intensity could lead to the extinction of sheep, which would ultimately harm the wolf population as well. A lower theta allows for a focus on competition with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 0.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating a severe depletion of resources. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows for the potential recovery of the sheep population, which is crucial for the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.30, which means aggressive hunting would further deplete their numbers and jeopardize the long-term survival of both species. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.26, which means aggressive hunting could lead to their extinction. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.20 to 0.25, I can still focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",

To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent further decline in sheep numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.22, which means aggressive hunting could lead to their extinction. By adopting a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover. This gradual adjustment is essential for maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.21, and my previous theta of 0.200 was too focused on competition with other wolves.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.22, which is only 0.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.200 will help me focus more on competition with other wolves while still keeping an eye on the need for future hunting as conditions improve.",
