            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 7.8% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a stable wolf population. This gradual adjustment will help ensure long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.36, which is only 2.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderate to allow the sheep to recover while still ensuring the wolf population remains stable. A gradual increase in theta will help maintain a balance between hunting and competing with other wolves, promoting long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the wolf population is relatively high. A slight increase in hunting intensity will allow for some reproduction among wolves while still giving sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance without risking a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, it is crucial to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity and give the sheep a chance to rebound, while also managing competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 0.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. This indicates that the sheep are under significant pressure. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while still competing with other wolves. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a significant competition for resources. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of adapting to changing conditions without causing sudden disruptions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low at 0.09. This indicates that hunting intensity should remain low to allow the sheep population to recover. Maintaining a theta of 0.30 will help ensure the long-term survival of both species while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable for hunting. Maintaining a lower theta allows the sheep to recover while preventing overcompetition among wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and ensures the long-term survival of both species."
