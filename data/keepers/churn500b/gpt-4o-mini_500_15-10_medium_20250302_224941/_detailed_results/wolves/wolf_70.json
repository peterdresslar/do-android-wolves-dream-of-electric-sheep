            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.6% of maximum capacity, and my previous theta was quite low at 0.273. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach to hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves. This adjustment will help maintain the sheep population and ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 70.82, which is only 7.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is an opportunity to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A gradual increase to 0.40 balances the need for hunting with the importance of not depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.31, which is only 3.4% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting sheep. This moderate adjustment will help balance the populations over time.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 2.5% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.20, which is only 1.9% of its maximum capacity. While I need to focus on hunting to ensure the survival of my pack, I must also be cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.2% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a significant scarcity of prey. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting.",
