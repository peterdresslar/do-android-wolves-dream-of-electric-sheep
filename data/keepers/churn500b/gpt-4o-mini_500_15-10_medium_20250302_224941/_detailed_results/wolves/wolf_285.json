            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for some increased hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while still considering the long-term health of the sheep population. A moderate increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach as the sheep population is recovering.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 42.96, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. While I need to maintain a balance, a moderate hunting intensity will allow for some reproduction among wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover. This adjustment is gradual and considers the current low sheep population and the growing wolf numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. This will help create a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity. Maintaining a low hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover and prevents further depletion, which is essential for the long-term survival of both species. Additionally, with a high wolf population, focusing on competition rather than hunting will help stabilize our numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their extinction. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while still competing with other wolves. This approach aligns with my objective of ensuring the long-term survival of both species."
