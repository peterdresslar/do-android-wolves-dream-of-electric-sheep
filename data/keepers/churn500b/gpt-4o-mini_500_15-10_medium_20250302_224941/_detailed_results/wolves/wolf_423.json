            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 167\n- Sheep population: 42.96\n- Wolf population: 208.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.380\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.21 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 4.3% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 42.96, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure long-term sustainability, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting intensely. This lower theta will help balance the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is quite high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting sheep. This will allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. A theta of 0.30 represents a cautious approach, balancing the need to compete with other wolves while giving sheep a chance to rebound.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to rebuild their numbers while also managing the competition with other wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.30, and my previous theta of 0.250 was already focused on hunting. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to reduce my hunting intensity further. This will help create a more sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.26, which means aggressive hunting could lead to their extinction. Maintaining a low theta allows for the sheep to recover while ensuring the wolf population does not overextend itself. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.22, which means aggressive hunting could lead to their extinction. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a small focus on hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a balance and adapting to the current state of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.21, which means aggressive hunting could lead to their extinction. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while still competing with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.21, which is only 0.0% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity further to allow the sheep population to recover. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.20 to 0.25 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for wolf survival with the critical state of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.22, and focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to recover. A lower hunting intensity will help ensure the long-term survival of both species, as we need to avoid depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.22, which is only 0.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that aggressive hunting could lead to the extinction of sheep, jeopardizing the long-term survival of both species. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, promoting a gradual recovery of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.23, which is only 0.0% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain a balance and prevent further depletion of the sheep, while also considering the current high wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.26, which is only 0.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.200 to 0.25, I can still maintain some hunting activity while prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both populations. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of avoiding sudden changes and responding to the current state of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and my previous theta was focused on hunting. By increasing my theta slightly to 0.30, I can shift my focus towards competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a balance and responding to the current state of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.34, which is only 0.0% of maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent further depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 0.0% of maximum capacity, indicating a significant depletion. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.30 allows for some hunting while prioritizing competition with other wolves, which is necessary given the low sheep numbers."
