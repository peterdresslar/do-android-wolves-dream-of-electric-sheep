            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 164\n- Sheep population: 274.85\n- Wolf population: 48.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.111\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 5.73 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 27.5% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 27.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with a wolf population of 48, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure the long-term survival of both species. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while also focusing on competition with other wolves, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual increase is necessary to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring a balance that supports both species in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.7% of maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach to hunting while still considering the need to compete with other wolves as the population is close to equilibrium.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 42.96, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing competition with other wolves, which will help stabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to replenish while also managing competition with other wolves. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both species."
