            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 167\n- Sheep population: 42.96\n- Wolf population: 208.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.396\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.21 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 4.3% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 42.96, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should prioritize the recovery of the sheep population while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our own health. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, reducing hunting intensity slightly to support sheep recovery while still competing with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep population. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to rebound while also managing competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to replenish while also managing the competition with other wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity. Increasing hunting intensity could lead to the extinction of sheep, which would ultimately harm our wolf population in the long run. A lower theta allows for a focus on competition with other wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 0.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating a critical depletion. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover while also addressing the competition among wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.30, which means aggressive hunting could lead to their extinction. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.26, which means that aggressive hunting could lead to their extinction. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep population to recover while ensuring the long-term survival of both species. A gradual approach is essential to maintain balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 0.24, which is very low. To allow for recovery, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity while still competing with other wolves. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.20 to 0.25 allows for a slight shift towards competition without further depleting the sheep, promoting long-term balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.22, indicating that aggressive hunting would further deplete their numbers and jeopardize the long-term survival of both species. By focusing on competition with other wolves at a lower theta, I can allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.21, which is only a fraction of their maximum capacity. Increasing hunting intensity would further deplete the sheep, jeopardizing both their survival and the long-term health of our wolf pack. Maintaining a low theta allows the sheep population a chance to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and my previous focus on competition has not allowed for recovery. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help balance the needs of my pack while still allowing for some sheep recovery. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.21, which indicates that aggressive hunting could lead to their extinction. By reducing my hunting intensity further, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing the competition with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and my previous theta was focused on hunting. To allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining some hunting for my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.22, which is only 0.0% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting. This lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and give the sheep a chance to rebound.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.23, which is only 0.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that aggressive hunting could lead to the extinction of sheep, jeopardizing the long-term survival of both species. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.200 to 0.25, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population a chance to recover. This small adjustment aligns with the wisdom of making gradual changes to maintain balance.",
