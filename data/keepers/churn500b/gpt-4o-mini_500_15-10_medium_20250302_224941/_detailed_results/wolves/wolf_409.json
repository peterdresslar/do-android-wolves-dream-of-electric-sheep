While I need to maintain a healthy wolf population, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help balance the needs of my pack while giving the sheep a chance to rebound.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.40, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to gradually recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help the sheep population stabilize and ensure long-term survival for both species. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their extinction. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while still competing with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to gradually increase in numbers while also managing competition with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.30, which means aggressive hunting would further deplete their numbers and threaten the ecosystem",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 0.24, which is very low. To allow for recovery, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity while still competing with other wolves. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.21, and my previous theta of 0.250 was already focused on hunting. To allow the sheep to recover, I need to reduce my hunting intensity further, focusing on competition with other wolves instead. This will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",

To allow the sheep to recover, I need to focus on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting.
