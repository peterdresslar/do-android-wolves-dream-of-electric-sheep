            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 49.30, which is only 4.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can grow, ultimately supporting the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 2.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. This suggests that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.25 to 0.30, I can maintain a focus on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, which will help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.97, which is only 1.3% of its maximum capacity. While I need to focus on hunting to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 1.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, it is crucial to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help the sheep population stabilize while also managing competition with other wolves. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of my ancestors, promoting a sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to recover. This approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species and avoids depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. This gradual approach will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and my previous theta was too focused on competition with other wolves. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can help ensure the survival of my pack while still allowing the sheep population to recover. This small adjustment aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence."
