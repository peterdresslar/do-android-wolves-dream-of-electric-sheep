        "explanations": [
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 77.57, which is only 7.8% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a moderate increase in hunting intensity to help sustain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.75 strikes a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring we do not deplete the sheep too quickly while still benefiting from their population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 43.14, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. While I need to maintain a balance to ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I can afford to increase my hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly. A theta of 0.60 allows for a moderate increase in hunting while still considering the need for sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.36, which is only 2.4% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the survival of my pack, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.45 strikes a balance between hunting and allowing the sheep population to stabilize, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while still competing with other wolves. This moderate approach will help maintain a balance and prevent a crash in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. Focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep population to recover while preventing overhunting, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both species by preventing overhunting and allowing for a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low at 0.09. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. A gradual adjustment to 0.30 will help balance the competition among wolves while still allowing for some hunting, promoting long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. This will help create a more sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable for hunting. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to recover while ensuring our own survival in the long term. This gradual adjustment will help create a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.4% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. Maintaining a lower theta allows the sheep to recover while preventing overcompetition among wolves. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and ensures the long-term survival of both species."
