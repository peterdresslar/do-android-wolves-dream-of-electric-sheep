            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for some hunting without risking depletion. However, I want to maintain a balance as the wolf population is relatively stable, so a slight reduction from my previous theta will help ensure long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.7% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking their long-term survival. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 42.96, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. While my previous theta of 0.700 was effective for hunting, it risks depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.50 allows for a balanced approach, enabling me to maintain my wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of gradual changes and sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. Focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem. This gradual approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.1% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while preventing overcompetition among wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.1% of its maximum capacity.
