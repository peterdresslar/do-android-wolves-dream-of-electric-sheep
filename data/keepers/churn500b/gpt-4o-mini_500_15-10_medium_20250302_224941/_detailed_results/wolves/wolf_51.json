            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring the sheep can recover over time.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level (12.0% of maximum capacity), which suggests that a more moderate hunting intensity is appropriate to allow for recovery. While the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are enough sheep for hunting, I want to avoid depleting their numbers too quickly. A theta of 0.45 allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some hunting to support the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 49.30, which is only 4.9% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting sheep. This lower theta will allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 2.5% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.30 represents a cautious approach that balances competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to increase their numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at only 1.9% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low at 0.24. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover while also considering the growing wolf population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.42, which is only 1.5% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a slight increase in hunting intensity. A gradual increase to 0.35 reflects a balanced approach that supports the sheep population while also considering the needs of the wolf pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.2% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.0% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover.
