        "explanations": [
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.0% of maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are more sheep available relative to wolves. This suggests that I should focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover while still competing with other wolves. A gradual increase in theta will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 7.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are not enough sheep to sustain aggressive hunting. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 43.14, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow the sheep to recover while still ensuring the wolf population can sustain itself. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a cautious approach to hunting, promoting balance without risking depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.36, which is only 2.4% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure long-term sustainability, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting intensively. This will help balance the ecosystem and prevent the depletion of sheep, while also allowing for a gradual adjustment in hunting intensity as conditions change.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help us maintain our population while allowing the sheep to recover. This adjustment is small enough to avoid drastic impacts on the ecosystem, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting."
