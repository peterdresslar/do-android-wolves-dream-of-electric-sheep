            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help ensure the wolf population can thrive while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual adjustment is key to maintaining balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly and to adapt to the current dynamics of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that can support wolf reproduction while preventing over-depletion of the sheep. This balance helps maintain the ecosystem",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level (18.0% of maximum capacity), which allows for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. However, with the wolf population at 31, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 15.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of gradual changes and supports a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting approach. This will help maintain the balance between wolf and sheep populations while avoiding overhunting. As the sheep population is still recovering, a slight reduction in hunting intensity will support long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 7.8% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. A lower theta allows for a focus on competition among wolves, which can help stabilize our numbers while giving sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 43.14, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. Given the high wolf population of 123, it is crucial to focus on competition among wolves to allow the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help prevent overhunting and promote a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.36, which is only 2.4% of its maximum capacity. While I need to focus on hunting to ensure the survival of my pack, I must also be cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of sheep and maintaining a balance with the wolf population."
