            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 27.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 48, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to prevent a crash in the sheep population. A moderate increase to 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.7% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term survival of both species. This moderate adjustment helps maintain a balance as the wolf population is also at a critical level, ensuring we do not over-deplete the sheep while still allowing for some reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can help stabilize the ecosystem and promote a healthier balance between the two populations."
