However, with a relatively high sheep-to-wolf ratio of 8.60, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A moderate increase in hunting intensity allows for a balance that supports wolf reproduction while giving sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 18.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with a wolf population of 31, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure the long-term survival of both species. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep can recover. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a sustainable ecosystem without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and I want to maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support reproduction while still being cautious to avoid depleting the sheep population too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 7.8% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta value will help balance hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 43.14, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity and give the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, while also managing competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the wolf population is relatively high. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a bit more hunting to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further.
