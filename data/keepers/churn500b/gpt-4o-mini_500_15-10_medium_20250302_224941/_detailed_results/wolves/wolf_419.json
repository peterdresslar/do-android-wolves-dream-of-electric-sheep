This indicates that the sheep need time to recover, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to rebuild their numbers. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help ensure a sustainable balance while still keeping an eye on the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and my previous focus on hunting has led to a significant depletion of their numbers. By adopting a lower theta, I can prioritize competition with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to recover while ensuring our own survival in the long term. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover and prevents overexploitation, which is crucial for the long-term survival of both species. Additionally, with the wolf population already high, it",

To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. This lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 0.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating a critical depletion. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure long-term sustainability, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting. This lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and give the sheep a chance to rebound.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. A small increase from my previous theta will help balance competition with other wolves while giving sheep a chance to rebound.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.21, and my previous theta of 0.25 was already focused on hunting. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep population by reducing my hunting intensity. This will allow the sheep to rebound while maintaining a sustainable wolf population.",

To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. A theta of 0.30 represents a slight increase from my previous value, reflecting a cautious approach to balance competition with other wolves while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep.",
