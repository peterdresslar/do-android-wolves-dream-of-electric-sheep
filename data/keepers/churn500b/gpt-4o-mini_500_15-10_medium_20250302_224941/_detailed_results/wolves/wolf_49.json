            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for increased hunting intensity without risking depletion. A moderate increase from my previous theta will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can still recover over time.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively low at 9.6% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing sheep to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 70.82, which is only 7.1% of its maximum capacity. While I need to maintain a balance to ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, a slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted to take advantage of the current sheep population without depleting it too quickly. This moderate approach allows for sustainable coexistence while still supporting the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 49.30, which is only 4.9% of its maximum capacity. While I need to maintain a healthy wolf population, I also want to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.45 will help me balance hunting with the need for sheep to increase their numbers, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.31, which is only 3.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to rebuild their numbers. Additionally, with the wolf population at 94, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.96, which is only 2.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This approach aligns with my objective of ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.20, which is only 1.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow for sheep recovery while still enabling some hunting to support the wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a cautious approach to hunting without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to repopulate while also managing the wolf population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 1.3% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting sheep. This lower theta will help balance the populations and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.2% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable for hunting. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to recover while ensuring our own numbers remain stable. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of sustainable coexistence."
