            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.0% of its maximum capacity, and my previous theta was quite low at 0.152. To allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a focus on competition with other wolves, a slight increase to 0.25 will help balance the needs of both populations without risking a rapid depletion of sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level (17.4% of maximum capacity), allowing for a gradual increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate approach will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term sustainability while still allowing for some growth in the wolf pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 154.10, which is only 15.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to help sustain our wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level (12.0% of maximum capacity), which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. However, since the wolf population is also significant, I need to maintain a balance to ensure both populations can thrive. A moderate increase from my previous theta allows for sustainable hunting while still considering the long-term health of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at only 4.3% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. This moderate approach will help create a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.36, which is only 2.4% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity and give the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, while also allowing the wolf population to stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.13, which is only 1.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting to support the wolf population. A small increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a gradual adjustment in response to the current state of the ecosystem."
