            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain our wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.6% of maximum capacity, indicating that we should focus on a balanced approach to allow sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for some hunting without over-depleting the sheep, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 70.82, which is only 7.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 strikes a balance between competing with other wolves and allowing the sheep population to stabilize, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 49.30, which is only 4.9% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.96, which is only 2.5% of its maximum capacity. While I need to focus on hunting to ensure the survival of my pack, I must also be cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep and maintaining a balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.9% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a significant competition for resources. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing the wolf population more sustainably. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.3% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population.
