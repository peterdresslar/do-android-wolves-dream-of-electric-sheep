            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 169\n- Sheep population: 1.64\n- Wolf population: 178.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.685\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.01 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 0.2% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to replenish their numbers while also addressing the competition among wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to repopulate while still competing with other wolves. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a balance between both populations and ensure long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 0% of its maximum capacity, indicating a critical depletion. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting. This moderate adjustment will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent further decline in the sheep population."
