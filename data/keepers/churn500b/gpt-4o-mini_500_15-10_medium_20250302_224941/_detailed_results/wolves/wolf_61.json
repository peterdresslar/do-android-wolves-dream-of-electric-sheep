This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing for some recovery of the sheep, maintaining a balance between the two species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.6% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing sheep to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.31, which is only 3.4% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.60 allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep further. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.96, which is only 2.5% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, enabling some hunting while also giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 1.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help the sheep population rebound while ensuring the long-term survival of our pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 1.3% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A gradual reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and prevent a crash in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and my previous theta was too focused on hunting. By increasing to 0.30, I can slightly intensify my hunting while still allowing the sheep population to recover. This approach balances my need for sustenance with the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a significant scarcity of prey. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting.",
