            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 23.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. A moderate increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still considering the long-term health of both populations. This approach helps maintain a balance as the wolf population grows.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.7% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 42.96, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By setting a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to gradually increase while maintaining a sustainable balance for the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure and give the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, while also allowing the wolf population to stabilize without drastic competition.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. Focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to recover while ensuring our pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity, which necessitates a cautious approach to allow for recovery. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to rebuild their numbers. This aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and ensures the long-term survival of both species."
