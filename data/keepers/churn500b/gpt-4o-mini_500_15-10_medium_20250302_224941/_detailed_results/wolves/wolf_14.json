            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 145.74, which is only 14.6% of its maximum capacity. While my previous theta of 0.911 indicates a strong hunting approach, I need to moderate my intensity to allow the sheep to recover and prevent over-depletion. A theta of 0.75 strikes a balance between hunting enough to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to grow sustainably.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. It reflects a balance between competing with other wolves and hunting, promoting coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level (15.0% of maximum capacity), which allows for a moderate increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly, allowing for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, allowing for some hunting without risking depletion. However, with the wolf population also being relatively stable, a moderate approach will help maintain balance and allow for gradual recovery of both populations. This theta reflects a cautious strategy that prioritizes sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, allowing for some recovery while still maintaining a focus on competition with other wolves. This moderate approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both species without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 95.94, which is only 9.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is an opportunity to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A gradual increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, ensuring that we do not deplete the sheep too quickly while also considering the growth of our wolf pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 49.30, which is only 4.9% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help balance the ecosystem and prevent over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.31, which is only 3.4% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.96, which is only 2.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a slight hunting intensity to support our own population. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.30 to 0.35 reflects a balanced approach that considers both the current low sheep numbers and the need for sustainable coexistence."
