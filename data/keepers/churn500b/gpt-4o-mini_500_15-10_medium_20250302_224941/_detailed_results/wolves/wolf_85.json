            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 70.82, which is only 7.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are in a vulnerable state and need time to recover. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help the sheep population stabilize while also allowing for a gradual adjustment in the wolf population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 49.30, which is only 4.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also considering the growing wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.30 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack without depleting the sheep further, promoting a more balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.31, which is only 3.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.30 to 0.35, I can still focus on competition with other wolves while allowing for some hunting to support reproduction. This gradual adjustment helps maintain a balance between the wolf and sheep populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to replenish while also considering the growing wolf population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and promotes long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 10.40, which is just 1.0% of its maximum capacity. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while preventing overcompetition among wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. A gradual decrease in theta will help balance competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to rebound.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.45, which is only 0.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are under pressure and need time to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and promotes long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta will help balance the need for sustenance while still considering the long-term health of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 8.99, which is only 0.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are struggling, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to their further decline. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.28, which is only 0.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a slight hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A small increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while being mindful of the need to avoid over-depleting the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help create a more sustainable balance in the ecosystem."
