        "explanations": [
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction without overly depleting the sheep, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting approach. This will help maintain the balance between wolf and sheep populations while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep. Gradually adjusting my hunting intensity will support both the long-term survival of my pack and the recovery of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 7.8% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity slightly to allow the sheep to recover while still competing with other wolves. This moderate approach will help maintain a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 43.14, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting intensively. This will help maintain a balance and prevent the depletion of sheep, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.13, which is only 1.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. However, with a wolf population of 111, I must also ensure that my pack remains healthy. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for sustainable hunting."
