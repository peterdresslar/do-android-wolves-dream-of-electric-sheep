            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 7.8% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while also reducing competition among wolves, ensuring a more sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 43.14, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity and give the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, while also allowing the wolf population to stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.13, which is only 1.5% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on a balanced approach that allows the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting to maintain the wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta reflects a cautious strategy to adapt to the current conditions without overwhelming the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. This approach will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.7% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable for hunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This will help maintain a sustainable balance as I adapt to the current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 0.6% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover.
