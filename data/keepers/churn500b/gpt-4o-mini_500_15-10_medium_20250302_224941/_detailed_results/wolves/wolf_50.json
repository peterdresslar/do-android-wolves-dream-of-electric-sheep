            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that a lower hunting intensity is necessary to allow the sheep to recover. This adjustment also helps to reduce competition among wolves, leading to a healthier wolf population in the long term. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.18 allows for a careful balance without risking sudden population crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.0% of maximum capacity, allowing for a gradual increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 70.82, which is only 7.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is an opportunity to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction while still allowing for some recovery of the sheep population. A gradual increase to 0.40 helps maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly, considering the current dynamics.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 49.30, which is only 4.9% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable balance, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensifying hunting. This slight increase from my previous theta reflects a cautious approach to maintain wolf health while giving sheep a chance to rebound.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at only 3.4% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help create a sustainable balance without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.20, which is only 1.9% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will help me maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.3% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable for sustainable hunting. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover, ensuring long-term survival for both species."
