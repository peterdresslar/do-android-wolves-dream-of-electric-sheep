            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.7% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports my pack's reproductive needs while still considering the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.64, which is just 0.2% of its maximum capacity. Focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep population to recover, ensuring a sustainable future for both species. A lower theta will help prevent further depletion of the sheep and allow for a more balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. A gradual decrease in theta will help maintain a balance and prevent a crash in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a presence in the ecosystem. A slight increase from my previous theta will help me balance competition with other wolves and give the sheep a chance to rebound.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.30, which means aggressive hunting could lead to their extinction. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while still competing with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.26, which means aggressive hunting could lead to their extinction. By focusing on competition with other wolves at a lower theta, I can allow the sheep population to recover while ensuring the wolf pack remains stable."
