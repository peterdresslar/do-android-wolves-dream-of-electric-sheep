            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, allowing for some increased hunting intensity without risking their long-term survival. This value strikes a balance between ensuring the wolf population can thrive while still allowing the sheep to recover gradually.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively low at 9.6% of maximum capacity, allowing for some increased hunting intensity without risking depletion. However, with a wolf population of 76, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 49.30, which is only 4.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are in a vulnerable state, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to recover while also reducing competition among wolves. By adopting a more moderate approach, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species and maintain a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.31, which is only 3.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 strikes a balance between competing with other wolves and allowing the sheep population to stabilize, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to replenish their numbers while also managing competition with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.42, which is only 1.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.3% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. This suggests that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves and ensure a sustainable balance in the ecosystem, while also preparing for future increases in sheep numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.52, which is only 1.2% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a more balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still acknowledging the need for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable for hunting. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to recover while ensuring the long-term survival of both species. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of my ancestors to avoid sudden changes and promote a sustainable ecosystem."
