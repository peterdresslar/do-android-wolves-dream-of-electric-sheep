            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 7.8% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This balance will help sustain both the sheep and wolf populations while allowing for gradual adjustments as conditions change.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 43.14, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. While my previous theta of 0.650 allowed for some hunting, the current sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.40 strikes a balance between competing with other wolves and giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, ensuring long-term sustainability for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.36, which is only 2.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting without depleting the sheep further, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. This lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. A gradual decrease in theta will help create a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 6.72, which is only 0.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.30 represents a cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population. This balance is crucial for the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 0.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both species by allowing the sheep population to stabilize while we focus on competing with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and my previous theta of 0.25 was already focused on competition rather than hunting. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable balance, I will further reduce my hunting intensity while still being mindful of the wolf population dynamics.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 0.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should remain low to allow the sheep to recover. Additionally, with a relatively high wolf population, focusing on competition rather than aggressive hunting will help maintain balance and ensure the long-term survival of both species. A gradual increase from my previous theta will allow for a cautious approach to recovery."
