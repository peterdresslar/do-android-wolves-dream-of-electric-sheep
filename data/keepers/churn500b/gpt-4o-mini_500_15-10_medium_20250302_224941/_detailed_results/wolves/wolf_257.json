            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain our wolf population while ensuring that the sheep do not become over-depleted. A gradual adjustment is key to achieving a balance that supports both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population being slightly higher than the sheep population, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A moderate theta of 0.55 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting to support wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 42.96, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.40 strikes a balance between competing with other wolves and allowing the sheep population to stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than hunting sheep, I can help the sheep recover while ensuring the long-term survival of both species. This gradual adjustment will allow for a more sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help the sheep population rebound while ensuring the wolf pack remains stable. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem."
