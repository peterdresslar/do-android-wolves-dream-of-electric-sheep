            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for some hunting to support wolf reproduction. However, I must be cautious not to overhunt, as the sheep population is still recovering. A moderate decrease from my previous theta will help maintain balance while still allowing for growth.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 15.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for increased hunting without risking depletion. However, with a wolf population of 62, I must be cautious not to overhunt, so a moderate increase to 0.70 allows for sustainable growth while still focusing on competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that can support wolf reproduction while preventing over-depletion of the sheep. This balance will help maintain both populations in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 43.14, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.45 strikes a balance between hunting and allowing the sheep population to stabilize, promoting long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.36, which is only 2.4% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must prioritize the recovery of the sheep. A lower theta will allow for competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to rebound, maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than hunting sheep, I can allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a stable wolf population. This gradual adjustment helps ensure long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain balance and prevent a crash in the ecosystem."
