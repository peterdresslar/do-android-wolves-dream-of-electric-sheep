            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.6% of maximum capacity, indicating that they are vulnerable. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, enabling me to hunt enough to support the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. This gradual adjustment helps maintain a sustainable ecosystem without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 70.82, which is only 7.1% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a moderate approach that balances competition with other wolves while giving sheep a chance to increase their numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.20, which is only 1.9% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. This will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.5% of maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.3% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both populations."
