            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. Focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep population to recover while ensuring our own survival in the long term. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity. Focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to recover without further depleting their numbers. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a balance and ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",

To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. This lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent further decline in sheep numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.30, and my previous theta of 0.200 was too focused on competition with other wolves. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity to 0.25, I can help stabilize the sheep population while still being cautious not to deplete them further. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.26, indicating that aggressive hunting would further deplete their numbers and threaten long-term survival. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also focusing on competition with other wolves, which is necessary given the current high wolf population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
