            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 15.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 62, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both populations can thrive. A moderate theta of 0.55 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting to support wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.0% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that can help sustain both sheep and wolf populations. This value reflects a balanced approach, enabling us to maintain our numbers while allowing sheep to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 7.8% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta value will help balance hunting and competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.36, which is only 2.4% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting, promoting a healthier balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution in hunting. While I want to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must prioritize the recovery of the sheep. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that supports both populations without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a significant scarcity of prey. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent further depletion of the sheep."
