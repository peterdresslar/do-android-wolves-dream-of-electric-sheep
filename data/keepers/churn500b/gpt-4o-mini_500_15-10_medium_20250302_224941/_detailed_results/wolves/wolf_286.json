            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 23.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with a relatively high sheep-to-wolf ratio of 2.61, I need to be cautious not to overhunt. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting to support wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.7% of its maximum capacity, which allows for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a balance between the wolf and sheep populations while allowing for some growth in the wolf population as well.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity. Focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to recover, ensuring a sustainable future for both species. This gradual adjustment will help prevent a crash in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. This lower theta value will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population, which is essential for the sustainability of our pack."
