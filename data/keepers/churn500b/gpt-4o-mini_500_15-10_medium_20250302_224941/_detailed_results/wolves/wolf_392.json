            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates a need for recovery, so I will focus on competing with other wolves rather than hunting sheep. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can help the sheep population recover while ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity. Focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to recover, ensuring a sustainable future for both species. A gradual approach is necessary to avoid sudden population crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to replenish while also managing competition with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity. A lower theta allows for a focus on competing with other wolves, which will help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to recover. Gradual adjustments are essential to avoid sudden impacts on the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 0.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating a critical depletion. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. A moderate theta value will help maintain a balance while still considering the competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.26, which means aggressive hunting could lead to their extinction. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing competition with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.24, which is only a fraction of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting intensively. This lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and promote a healthier balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.22, and my previous theta of 0.200 was too focused on competition with other wolves. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity to 0.25, I can help the sheep population recover while still being mindful of the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.21, indicating a need for caution in hunting. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also reducing competition among wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and ensuring long-term survival for both species."
