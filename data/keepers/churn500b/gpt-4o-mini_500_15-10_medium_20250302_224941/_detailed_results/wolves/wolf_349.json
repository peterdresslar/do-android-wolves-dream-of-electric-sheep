            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 42.96, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. While my previous theta of 0.961 indicates a strong focus on hunting, I need to reduce my intensity slightly to allow the sheep population to recover. This adjustment will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population, which would ultimately threaten the wolves as well.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity, which necessitates a focus on competition with other wolves rather than hunting sheep. This will allow the sheep population to recover while we manage our own numbers more sustainably.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their extinction. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. A gradual decrease in theta will help maintain a balance while preventing further depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 0.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating a critical depletion. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity and promote a more sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.26, which means aggressive hunting could lead to their extinction. Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition among wolves while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and ensures the long-term survival of both species."
