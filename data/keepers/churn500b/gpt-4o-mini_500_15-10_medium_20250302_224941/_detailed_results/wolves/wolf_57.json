            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This approach balances our needs with the health of the ecosystem, avoiding overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.6% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help sustain both the sheep and wolf populations while allowing for some growth in our numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 70.82, which is only 7.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover rather than intensifying our hunting. A lower theta will help reduce competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to increase their numbers, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 49.30, which is only 4.9% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population, while also managing the competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.31, which is only 3.4% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 2.5% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. A gradual adjustment to 0.30 reflects a balanced approach that supports sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a significant scarcity of prey. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.97, which is only 1.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.30 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need to compete with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to support our population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining sustainable cycles.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.22, focusing on competition with other wolves is necessary to allow the sheep population to recover. A gradual reduction in hunting intensity will help ensure the long-term survival of both species."
