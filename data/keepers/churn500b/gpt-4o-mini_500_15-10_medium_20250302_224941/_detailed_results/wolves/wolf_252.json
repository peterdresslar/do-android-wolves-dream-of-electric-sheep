            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 27.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for increased hunting without risking immediate depletion. However, I want to avoid a drastic increase from my previous theta of 0.979 to maintain a balance and allow for sustainable coexistence. A theta of 0.85 reflects a strong but cautious approach to hunting, ensuring the wolf population can thrive while still allowing sheep to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 23.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with a relatively high wolf population, I need to be cautious not to deplete the sheep too quickly. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance while allowing for some recovery in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.7% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are nearly equal numbers of sheep and wolves. A moderate hunting intensity will allow for some replenishment of the sheep population while still enabling the wolf population to thrive. This approach balances the immediate need for sustenance with the long-term goal of maintaining a healthy ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 42.96, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. While my previous theta of 0.600 allowed for some hunting, it is important to shift towards a more balanced approach to allow the sheep population to recover. A moderate theta of 0.45 will help maintain a sustainable coexistence while still allowing for some hunting to support the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. This lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash."
