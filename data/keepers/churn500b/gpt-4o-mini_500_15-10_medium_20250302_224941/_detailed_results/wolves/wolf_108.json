            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 16.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. A moderate increase to 0.4 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while ensuring that the sheep population can recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid destabilizing the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively low at 17.4% of its maximum capacity, allowing for some recovery. By maintaining a moderate hunting intensity, I can ensure that both the sheep and wolf populations can stabilize and thrive without depleting resources too quickly. This approach also allows me to compete with other wolves while keeping the sheep population in check.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain the balance between wolf and sheep populations while ensuring that we do not over-deplete the sheep resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 7.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover. A slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted to maintain our population, but I want to avoid overexploitation. This moderate adjustment will help ensure a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 43.14, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.36, which is only 2.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates a need for cautious hunting to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a slight increase in hunting intensity to support the wolf population. A small increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach that considers both the current low sheep numbers and the need for sustainable coexistence."
