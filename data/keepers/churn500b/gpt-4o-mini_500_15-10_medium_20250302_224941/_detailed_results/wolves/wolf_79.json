            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.6% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This balance will help sustain both the wolf and sheep populations while adapting to the current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 70.82, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we are nearing a critical point for sustainable hunting. A moderate theta allows for some hunting to support our population while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This balance is essential for long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.96, which is only 2.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a moderate approach, balancing the need to compete with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to sustain the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.20, which is only 1.9% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity and promote a healthier balance in the ecosystem, preventing a crash in the sheep population and ensuring sustainable cycles.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.3% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity and give the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, while still allowing for some competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to replenish while also managing competition with other wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. A gradual approach will help maintain balance and prevent a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.02, which is only 0.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.30 maintains a focus on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, promoting a balance that can lead to sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta will help balance the need for sustenance while avoiding over-depletion of the sheep population."
