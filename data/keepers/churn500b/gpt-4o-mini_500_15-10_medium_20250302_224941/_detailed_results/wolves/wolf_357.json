            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that they need some time to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach to hunting while still focusing on competing with other wolves. This will help maintain a sustainable ecosystem without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 4.3% of maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to replenish while also managing competition with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to maintain a focus on competition with other wolves rather than hunting sheep. This will allow the sheep population to recover while keeping the wolf population stable.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help achieve this balance while avoiding drastic changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.1% of maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution in hunting. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on reducing competition with other wolves while allowing the sheep population a chance to recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 0.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating a critical depletion. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover and ensures the long-term survival of both species. It is essential to focus on competition with other wolves while allowing the ecosystem to stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.26, which is only a fraction of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent further depletion of sheep."
