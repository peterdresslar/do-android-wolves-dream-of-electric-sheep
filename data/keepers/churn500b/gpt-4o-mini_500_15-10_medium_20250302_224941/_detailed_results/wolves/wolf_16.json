            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly, and this balance supports both species in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover. A gradual increase is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term health of both sheep and wolves. This moderate adjustment helps maintain balance as the sheep population is recovering, and it allows for gradual adaptation to changing conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.0% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between hunting and competing with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 70.82, which is only 7.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By adopting a lower theta, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 49.30, which is only 4.9% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain a balance and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.31, which is only 3.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting to support the wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will help maintain balance without risking a crash in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 2.5% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain balance and prevent overhunting."
