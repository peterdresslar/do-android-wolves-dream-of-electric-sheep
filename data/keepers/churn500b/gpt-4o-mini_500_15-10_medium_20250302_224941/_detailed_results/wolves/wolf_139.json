            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while still ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is necessary to maintain balance and avoid over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level (15.4% of maximum capacity), allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This balance will help sustain both the wolf and sheep populations while allowing for gradual adjustments as conditions change.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 12.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 86, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting to support wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 7.8% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. A lower theta allows for more competition among wolves, which can help stabilize our numbers while giving sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash."
