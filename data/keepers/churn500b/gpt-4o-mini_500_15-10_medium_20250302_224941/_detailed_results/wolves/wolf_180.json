            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 120.10, which is only 12.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is potential for recovery in the sheep population. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep to recover, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem. This gradual adjustment will help maintain both populations over the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 77.57, which is only 7.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while being mindful of the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 43.14, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta value will help balance hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.36, which is only 2.4% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.13, which is only 1.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderate to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain its health. A small increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a gradual adjustment in hunting without risking a sudden depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure and give the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, while also allowing the wolf population to stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover. A gradual increase in theta will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.5% of its maximum capacity. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover and ensures the long-term survival of both species. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio, it is crucial to avoid overhunting and focus on competition among wolves instead."
