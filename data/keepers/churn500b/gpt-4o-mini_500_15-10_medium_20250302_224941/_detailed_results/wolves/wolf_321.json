            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.7% of its maximum capacity, and my previous theta was quite low at 0.276. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach to hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves. This adjustment supports sustainable coexistence and helps the sheep population recover without overexploiting them.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 42.96, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while maintaining a stable wolf population. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure and promote a more sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting sheep. This will allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity. Increasing my hunting intensity could lead to a further decline in sheep, jeopardizing the long-term survival of both species. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity. Increasing hunting intensity could lead to the extinction of sheep, which would ultimately harm the wolf population as well. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still being mindful of the need for sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 0.0% of maximum capacity, indicating a critical depletion. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows for the potential recovery of the sheep population while also reducing competition among wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and prioritizes long-term sustainability."
