            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 164\n- Sheep population: 274.85\n- Wolf population: 48.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.431\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 5.73 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 27.5% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.7% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a slight imbalance. A moderate hunting intensity will allow for some hunting while still enabling the sheep population to recover. This approach supports sustainable coexistence and prevents over-exploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 42.96, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. This lower theta will help maintain a balance and prevent further depletion of the sheep, which is essential for the sustainability of our ecosystem."
