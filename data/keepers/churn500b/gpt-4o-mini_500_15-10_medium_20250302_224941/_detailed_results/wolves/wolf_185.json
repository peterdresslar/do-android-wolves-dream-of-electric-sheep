            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 43.14, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.30 strikes a balance between competing with other wolves and allowing the sheep population to stabilize, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and my previous theta of 0.3 was already focused on competition with other wolves. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I will gradually increase my hunting intensity to 0.35, allowing for a slight increase in hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This small adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. Focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to recover, ensuring a sustainable future for both species. A gradual approach is essential to avoid drastic impacts on the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 0.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to grow. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid sudden impacts on the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 5.03, which is only 0.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are in a vulnerable state, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to their rapid decline. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover, ensuring a more sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and my previous theta was already on the lower end. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for a modest increase in hunting intensity, which can help sustain my pack without depleting the sheep population further. This approach aligns with the need for gradual adjustments while considering the current low sheep-to-wolf ratio."
