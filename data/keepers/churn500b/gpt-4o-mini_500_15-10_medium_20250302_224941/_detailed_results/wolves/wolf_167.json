            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 7.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that a more moderate hunting approach is necessary to allow for recovery. While my previous theta was slightly higher, I need to focus on balancing the wolf population and ensuring the sheep can regenerate. This adjustment will help maintain a sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 43.14, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta value of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and allowing the sheep population to stabilize, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 2.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to replenish while also managing competition with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a significant scarcity of prey. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity, I can help ensure the survival of my pack while still allowing the sheep population to recover. This moderate adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and promote sustainable cycles.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.7% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep population to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and my previous theta was already on the lower end. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for a modest increase in hunting intensity, which can help sustain my pack while still giving sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both species by preventing overhunting and allowing for a sustainable balance."
