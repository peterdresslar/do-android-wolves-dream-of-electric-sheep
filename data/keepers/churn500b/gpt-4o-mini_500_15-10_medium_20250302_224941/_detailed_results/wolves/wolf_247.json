            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 164\n- Sheep population: 274.85\n- Wolf population: 48.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.190\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 5.73 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 27.5% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 27.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 48, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A gradual increase in theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves to maintain a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.7% of its maximum capacity, and my previous theta was quite low at 0.25. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I will gradually increase my hunting intensity to 0.30. This allows for a slight increase in hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 42.96, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a slight hunting intensity to support the wolf population. A small increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach that encourages coexistence without depleting the sheep further."
