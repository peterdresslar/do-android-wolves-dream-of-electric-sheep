            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 18.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with a wolf population of 31, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure long-term survival. A moderate increase to 0.4 allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, promoting a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain the wolf population while ensuring the sheep do not become overly depleted. A gradual increase aligns with the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and allows for a balanced approach.",

This adjustment reflects a balanced approach, ensuring the wolf population can thrive while still allowing sheep to recover.",

To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate decrease in hunting intensity will help balance the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 43.14, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain a balance and prevent overhunting, ensuring sustainable cycles.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.36, which is only 2.4% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the sustainability of both populations. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
