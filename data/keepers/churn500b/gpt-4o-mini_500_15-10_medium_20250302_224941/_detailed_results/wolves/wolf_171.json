            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.0% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations while ensuring our long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 4.3% of maximum capacity, indicating that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow for recovery. By maintaining a moderate hunting intensity, I can ensure that the sheep have a chance to rebound while also keeping the wolf population stable. This balance will help prevent overexploitation and promote long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 2.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to replenish while also managing competition with other wolves. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help us sustain our population while allowing the sheep to recover gradually. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and making small adjustments to ensure long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 0.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.5% of its maximum capacity, which indicates that aggressive hunting could lead to their depletion. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover while also keeping the wolf population stable. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and promotes long-term coexistence."
