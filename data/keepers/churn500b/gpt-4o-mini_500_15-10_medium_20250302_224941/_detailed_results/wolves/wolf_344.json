            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.7% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. A moderate theta value will help maintain a balance while still allowing for some hunting to sustain the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population, which is essential for the future of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 0.0% of maximum capacity, indicating a critical depletion. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows for the potential recovery of the sheep population while also considering the current high wolf population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.30, which means aggressive hunting could lead to their extinction. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep population to recover while ensuring the long-term survival of both species. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance."
