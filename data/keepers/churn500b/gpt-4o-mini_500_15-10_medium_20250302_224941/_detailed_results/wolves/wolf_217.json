This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.4 strikes a balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep, promoting sustainability without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.36, which is only 2.4% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity and give the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, while also allowing the wolf population to stabilize without competing too aggressively.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. A gradual decrease in theta will help maintain balance without causing sudden disruptions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 6.72, which is only 0.7% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A theta of 0.30 reflects a cautious approach that balances competition with other wolves and allows for some hunting without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 5.68, which is only 0.6% of its maximum capacity. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover and ensures the long-term survival of both species. Given the high wolf population of 64, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while preventing overcompetition among wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and sustainable coexistence.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and my previous theta was already on the lower end. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for a modest increase in hunting intensity, which can help sustain my pack while still allowing the sheep population to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a balance and responding to the current state of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.4% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, it is crucial to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population, which would ultimately harm the wolf population as well.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should remain low to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance while still allowing for some hunting to support the wolf population.",

To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. This will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a more balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still recognizing the need for wolves to sustain their population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 5.59, which is only 0.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both our wolf pack and the sheep, while also being mindful of the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 5.96, which is only 0.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are struggling, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.300 to 0.35, I can still maintain some hunting pressure while prioritizing the long-term survival of both species. This small adjustment aligns with the wisdom of gradual changes and helps ensure a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 6.38, which is only 0.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help ensure the sheep population stabilizes while allowing the wolf population to adjust gradually. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",

This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover.
