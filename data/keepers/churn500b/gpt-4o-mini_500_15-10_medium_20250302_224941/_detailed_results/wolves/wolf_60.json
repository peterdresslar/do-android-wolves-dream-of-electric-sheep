            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 70.82, which is only 7.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more moderate hunting intensity is necessary to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. By setting theta at 0.45, I can balance the need for hunting with the importance of sustainable coexistence, avoiding overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.31, which is only 3.4% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A lower theta will help reduce competition among wolves and give sheep a chance to increase their numbers, creating a more sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain balance and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.42, which is only 1.5% of its maximum capacity. While I need to focus on hunting to ensure the survival of my pack, I must also be cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also reducing competition among wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. A gradual adjustment to 0.25 will help balance the competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to increase their numbers."
