            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By focusing more on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can allow the sheep population to stabilize and grow, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting sheep. This lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a collapse.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to repopulate while also managing the competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of sustainable coexistence and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover and increases the chances of sustainable coexistence. Given the current wolf population is relatively high, it is essential to focus on allowing the sheep to rebound rather than depleting them further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.26, which means aggressive hunting would further deplete their numbers and threaten the ecosystem",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.24, and my previous theta of 0.250 was already focused on hunting. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to prioritize competition with other wolves and reduce hunting intensity. This gradual adjustment will help restore balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.22, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their extinction. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This balance is essential for the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.21, which means aggressive hunting would further deplete their numbers and threaten the long-term survival of both species. By focusing on competition with other wolves instead, I can allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining our own numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.21, and my previous theta of 0.200 was too focused on competition with other wolves. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity, I can help stabilize the sheep population while still being cautious not to deplete them further. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a balance for long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.21, which is only 0.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.30 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need to compete with other wolves while giving sheep a chance to increase their numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.22, which is only 0.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both species by preventing further depletion of the sheep population while also allowing the wolf population to stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.26, which is only 0.0% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain a balance and prevent overhunting, which could lead to a collapse of the ecosystem."
