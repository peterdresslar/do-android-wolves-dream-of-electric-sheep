Gradually increasing my hunting intensity to 0.25 allows for a cautious approach to support wolf reproduction while still giving sheep a chance to recover. This balance helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 22.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with only 2 wolves, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting, which could lead to a crash in the sheep population. A moderate increase to 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 24.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for more hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance that supports both wolf and sheep populations. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of adapting to changing conditions without risking depletion.",

This will help maintain a balance between the wolf and sheep populations while avoiding overhunting. Gradually adjusting to a lower theta will also allow the sheep to recover and ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still ensuring that the sheep population can recover and thrive. A gradual increase in theta reflects a balanced approach to coexistence, responding to the current state of the ecosystem without risking overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 42.96, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population.
