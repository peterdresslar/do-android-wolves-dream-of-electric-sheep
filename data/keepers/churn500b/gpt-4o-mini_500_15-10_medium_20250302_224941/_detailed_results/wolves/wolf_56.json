            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain our wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that a more moderate hunting intensity is necessary to allow for recovery. This balance will help sustain both the sheep and wolf populations while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 70.82, which is only 7.1% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting sheep. A lower theta will allow the sheep population to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.31, which is only 3.4% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.20, which is only 1.9% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a slight hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.30 to 0.35 reflects a cautious approach to balance competition with other wolves and the need for sustenance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain a balance and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 1.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure and give the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, while also allowing the wolf population to stabilize without drastic competition.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem."
