            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 43.14, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. While my previous theta of 0.604 indicates a more aggressive hunting strategy, it is crucial to allow the sheep population to recover. A moderate theta of 0.4 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring both populations can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. While my previous theta of 0.4 was focused on moderate hunting, I believe a slight reduction to 0.35 will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting to maintain the wolf population. This small adjustment aligns with the wisdom of gradual changes and will help ensure a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. This lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable for sustainable hunting. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also addressing the competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.4% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population. A moderate theta will help maintain a balance, preventing overhunting and allowing for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.4% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both species while maintaining a healthy balance in the ecosystem."
