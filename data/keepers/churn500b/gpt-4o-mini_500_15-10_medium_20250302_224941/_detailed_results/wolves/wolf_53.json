            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.6% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate hunting approach that can help sustain both populations. This value balances the need for hunting to support wolf reproduction while also allowing the sheep population to recover. It reflects a cautious strategy in response to the current ecosystem state.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.31, which is only 3.4% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help balance the ecosystem and prevent over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 2.5% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.20, which is only 1.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity to 0.35, I can still maintain some hunting pressure while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and helps ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are not enough sheep to sustain higher hunting intensity. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a healthy balance in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.3% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep population to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and ensures the long-term survival of both species."
