            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 70.82, which is only 7.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover, and a lower hunting intensity will allow for their population to stabilize. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help ensure a sustainable balance while still keeping an eye on future hunting opportunities as the sheep population increases.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 49.30, which is only 4.9% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 to 0.40 reflects a cautious approach to hunting, promoting a balance that supports both species in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.31, which is only 3.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced slightly to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 maintains a balance between competing with other wolves and allowing the sheep population to stabilize, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.96, which is only 2.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.20, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low at 0.24. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain balance and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.3% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and my previous theta was focused on hunting. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to shift my focus towards competition with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to recover while still maintaining a slight hunting intensity.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. A gradual adjustment to 0.25 will help balance competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to increase their numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.45, which is only 0.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while ensuring that the sheep population has a chance to grow, promoting long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be cautiously increased to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while being mindful of the sheep"
