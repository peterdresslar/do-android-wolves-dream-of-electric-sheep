            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 23.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 89, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both species can thrive. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 42.96, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting sheep. This lower theta will allow the sheep population to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. Focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to recover while ensuring our own population stabilizes. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem."
