            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.8% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without depleting their numbers too quickly. This value reflects a balanced approach, enabling us to maintain a healthy wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.0% of maximum capacity, allowing for a gradual increase in hunting intensity while still focusing on competition with other wolves. This balance will help ensure the sheep can recover while maintaining a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively low at 9.6% of maximum capacity, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still allowing for some recovery of the sheep population. A gradual increase is essential to maintain balance.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 49.30, which is only 4.9% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.31, which is only 3.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain its health. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a cautious approach to hunting, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 2.5% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.20, which is only 1.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting to support the wolf population.
