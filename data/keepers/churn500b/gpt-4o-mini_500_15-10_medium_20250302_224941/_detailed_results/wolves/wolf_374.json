            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 42.96, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. While my previous theta of 0.717 indicates a strong hunting approach, it is essential to reduce hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. A moderate theta of 0.45 strikes a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity. Focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to recover, ensuring a sustainable future for both species. A lower theta will help prevent further depletion of the sheep population while maintaining our pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can allow the sheep to gradually replenish while maintaining a stable wolf population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of making small adjustments to ensure long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.30, and my previous theta of 0.250 was already too high given the current conditions. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and my previous theta was already low. To allow the sheep to recover, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance while still allowing for some hunting as the sheep population begins to stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.24, and my previous theta of 0.250 was already focused on hunting. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure long-term survival for both species, I need to reduce my hunting intensity further. This lower theta will help the sheep population stabilize while also allowing for some competition among wolves."
