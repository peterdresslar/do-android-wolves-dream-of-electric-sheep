            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, allowing for some recovery. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 12.61, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A moderate approach balances our needs with the ecosystem",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment reflects a balance between ensuring the wolf population can thrive while still allowing the sheep to recover and maintain their numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 7.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are not enough sheep to support aggressive hunting. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while also reducing competition among wolves as their population is relatively high. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 4.3% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is quite low at 24.36, which is only 2.4% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability."
