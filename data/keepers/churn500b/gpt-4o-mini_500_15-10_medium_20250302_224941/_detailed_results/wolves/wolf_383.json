            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to repopulate while also addressing the growing wolf population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. Focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to recover, ensuring a sustainable future for both species. A gradual approach is necessary to avoid sudden crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity. Increasing hunting intensity could lead to the extinction of sheep, which would jeopardize the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep. A slight increase to 0.30 allows for a more balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing the sheep population a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 0.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating a critical depletion. Maintaining a lower theta allows for a focus on competition with other wolves rather than hunting, which will give the sheep population a chance to recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.30, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is 0.00. Focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to recover, ensuring a sustainable future for both species. A gradual reduction in hunting intensity is necessary to prevent further depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.26, which is only a fraction of its maximum capacity. Increasing hunting intensity could lead to further depletion of the sheep, jeopardizing long-term survival for both wolves and sheep. Maintaining a lower theta allows for the potential recovery of the sheep population while we focus on competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.22, indicating that aggressive hunting would further deplete their numbers and threaten long-term survival. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, which is necessary given the current wolf population. This balance aims to foster recovery in the sheep population without risking immediate wolf survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.21, which is 0.0% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity further. This will allow the sheep population to recover while preventing overcompetition among wolves."
