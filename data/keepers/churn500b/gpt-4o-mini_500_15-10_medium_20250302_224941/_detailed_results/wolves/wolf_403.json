            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help the sheep population stabilize and gradually increase, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.1% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while preventing overcompetition among wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover and prevent further depletion, which is essential for the long-term survival of both species. Given the current wolf population, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 0.0% of maximum capacity, indicating a critical depletion. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover and prevent further decline, ensuring long-term survival for both species. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.30, which means aggressive hunting would further deplete their numbers and threaten the ecosystem. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep population a chance to recover while maintaining the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and my previous hunting intensity was too high, leading to a complete depletion of sheep. By slightly increasing my theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.24, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a complete depletion of sheep. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent further decline in sheep numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.22, and my previous theta of 0.200 was already focused on competition rather than hunting. To allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a slight focus on my own population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.21, indicating that aggressive hunting would further deplete their numbers and jeopardize the long-term survival of both species. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and my previous focus on hunting has contributed to their decline. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity, I can help ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.21, which is only 0.0% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus on competing with other wolves rather than hunting. This lower theta will help stabilize the sheep population while also allowing for gradual adjustments in the future as conditions change."
