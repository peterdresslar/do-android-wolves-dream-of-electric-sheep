While my previous theta of 0.600 allowed for more intense hunting, it is crucial to allow the sheep population to recover. A moderate theta of 0.45 strikes a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability and ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help the sheep population rebound while allowing our own numbers to stabilize. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity, which necessitates a cautious approach. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing competition with other wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of sustainable coexistence and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
