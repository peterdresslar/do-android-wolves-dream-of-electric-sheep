            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 98\n- Sheep population: 43.14\n- Wolf population: 123.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.527\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.35 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 4.3% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 110\n- Sheep population: 4.24\n- Wolf population: 26.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.300\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.16 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 0.4% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 43.14, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A theta of 0.45 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for some hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.36, which is only 2.4% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting sheep. This will allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a healthy balance in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a significant competition for resources among wolves. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on reducing competition with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a significant scarcity of prey. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover while still maintaining a presence in the ecosystem. A moderate theta value will help balance the competition among wolves and allow for some hunting without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 6.72, which is only 0.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity to 0.35, I can still focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable for hunting. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to recover while ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep population to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 4.63, which is just 0.5% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting sheep. This lower theta will allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a healthy balance in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.4% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population. A gradual increase in theta will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.4% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. This indicates that hunting intensity needs to be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the ecosystem and ensure long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.4% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low at 0.14. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. A moderate theta of 0.30 will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and allowing the sheep to increase in numbers, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.4% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. This suggests that while we need to be cautious about overhunting, a slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted to ensure our survival and reproduction. A theta of 0.35 allows for a gradual increase in hunting while still prioritizing the long-term health of both populations."
