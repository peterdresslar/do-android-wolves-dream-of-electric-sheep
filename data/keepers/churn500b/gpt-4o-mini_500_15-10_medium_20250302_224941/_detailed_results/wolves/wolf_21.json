            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.1% of maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite high at 9.45. This indicates that there is a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep population to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while ensuring that the sheep have a chance to increase in number, promoting long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 15.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A moderate increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, enabling us to maintain our wolf population while still ensuring the sheep can recover over time.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.0% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf competition and sustainable hunting, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level (13.8% of maximum capacity), and while we need to ensure our survival through hunting, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 70.82, which is only 7.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is an opportunity to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A gradual increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, ensuring that we do not deplete the sheep too quickly while also considering the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.96, which is only 2.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By adopting a lower theta value, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to gradually increase while maintaining a healthy wolf population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of making small adjustments and ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help the sheep population stabilize and eventually grow, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem."
