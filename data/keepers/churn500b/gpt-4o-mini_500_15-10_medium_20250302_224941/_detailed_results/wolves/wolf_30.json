            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.0% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 138.34, which is only 13.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 reflects a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without risking a rapid depletion of sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 49.30, which is only 4.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta value of 0.35 will help balance the competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at only 3.4% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a stable wolf population. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.20, which is only 1.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow the sheep to recover while still providing some sustenance for the wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will help balance the need for food with the necessity of not depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting."
