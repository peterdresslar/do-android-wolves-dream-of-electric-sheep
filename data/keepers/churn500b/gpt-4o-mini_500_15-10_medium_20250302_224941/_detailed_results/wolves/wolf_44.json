            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, allowing for some hunting without risking depletion. A moderate approach will help maintain the balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term survival for both. This adjustment reflects a cautious increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.6% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. However, with the wolf population at 76, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.31, which is only 3.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By lowering my hunting intensity slightly, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 2.5% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. A gradual approach will help maintain balance without risking a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.20, which is only 1.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity to 0.35, I can still maintain some hunting pressure while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This approach aligns with the wisdom of making gradual adjustments and considering both immediate needs and long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, it is crucial to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population, which would ultimately harm the wolf population as well.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.52, which is only 1.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a slight hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A small increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep further."
