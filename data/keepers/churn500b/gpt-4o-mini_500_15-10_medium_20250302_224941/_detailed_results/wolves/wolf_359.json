            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.7% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while still maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 42.96, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. While my previous theta of 0.700 allowed for intense hunting, it is now crucial to adopt a more balanced approach to ensure the sheep can recover. A moderate theta of 0.50 will allow for some hunting while also giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, promoting long-term sustainability for both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a severe scarcity of prey. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can allow the sheep population to recover while ensuring the long-term survival of both species. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity. Focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to recover, ensuring a sustainable future for both species. A gradual approach is necessary to avoid further depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity. Increasing hunting intensity could lead to the extinction of sheep, which would ultimately harm the wolf population as well. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population a chance to recover, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 0.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating a critical depletion. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover and ensures the long-term survival of both species. As the wolf population is relatively high, it is prudent to focus on competition among wolves rather than aggressive hunting."
