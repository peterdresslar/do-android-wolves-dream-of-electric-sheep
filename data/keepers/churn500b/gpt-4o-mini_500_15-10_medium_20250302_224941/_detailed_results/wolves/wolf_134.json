            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that can help sustain both sheep and wolf populations. This approach balances the need for hunting to support wolf reproduction while avoiding over-depletion of the sheep, ensuring a healthier ecosystem in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 43.14, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should prioritize allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a presence in the hunting ground. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain the wolf population without further depleting the sheep, promoting a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.36, which is only 2.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to gradually increase while ensuring the wolf population remains stable.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.5% of its maximum capacity, which indicates a need for caution in hunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, enabling me to maintain some hunting intensity while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of avoiding sudden changes and promotes long-term sustainability for both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. This lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash."
