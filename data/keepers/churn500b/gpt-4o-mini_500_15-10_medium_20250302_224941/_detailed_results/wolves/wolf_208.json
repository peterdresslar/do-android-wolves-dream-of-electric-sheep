            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 43.14, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.45 strikes a balance between hunting and allowing the sheep population to stabilize, preventing overexploitation while still supporting wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.36, which is only 2.4% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting sheep. A moderate theta of 0.35 will help balance the needs of both populations while avoiding drastic changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. A moderate theta of 0.30 will help balance the need for wolves to compete with each other while still allowing for some hunting, promoting sustainability in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 0.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and ensure that both wolves and sheep can thrive in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 0.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By maintaining a moderate theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still keeping an eye on the sheep population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.12, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.4% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover. A moderate theta value will help me balance competition with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers without depleting them further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is very low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should remain cautious to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta will help balance the need for wolf survival while still allowing sheep to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.4% of maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity and give the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, which is essential for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.4% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep population to recover while also preventing overcompetition among wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and ensures the long-term survival of both species."
