            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can ensure the long-term survival of both species while also allowing the wolf population to stabilize without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.7% of its maximum capacity, which suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow for recovery. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from the previous theta of 0.30 to 0.35, I can still support the wolf population while giving sheep a chance to rebound. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 42.96, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to gradually increase while ensuring the wolf population remains stable.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. A gradual decrease in hunting will help maintain balance without causing sudden population crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep to recover. This lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population, which is essential for the future of my pack.",

To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. A gradual increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance while still considering the competition with other wolves."
