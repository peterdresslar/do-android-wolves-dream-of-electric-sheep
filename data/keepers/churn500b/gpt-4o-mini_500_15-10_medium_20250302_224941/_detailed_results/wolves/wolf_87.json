            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 70.82, which is only 7.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 49.30, which is only 4.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. By setting theta at 0.30, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring a balance that promotes the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.31, which is only 3.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are in a vulnerable state, and while I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must prioritize the recovery of the sheep. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, promoting a more sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.45, which is only 0.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting to support the wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a cautious approach to hunting, balancing the need for sustenance with the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.9% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are not enough sheep to sustain aggressive hunting. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to recover while ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.02, which is only 0.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should be cautious with our hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 8.99, which is only 0.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are under significant pressure, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to recover. Additionally, with a wolf population of 25, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low, suggesting that focusing on competition among wolves rather than aggressive hunting will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.09, which is only 0.9% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can allow the sheep to replenish while maintaining a stable wolf population. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should remain low to allow the sheep to recover. However, with a slight increase to 0.35, I can still maintain some hunting to support the wolf population without risking the depletion of sheep. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance."
