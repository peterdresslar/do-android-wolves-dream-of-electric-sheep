            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 7.8% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. However, since the wolf population is relatively high, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure long-term sustainability. A moderate increase in theta will help maintain a balance while still allowing for some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 43.14, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. While I need to maintain a focus on hunting to support the wolf population, I must also be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A slight reduction in hunting intensity allows for some recovery of the sheep while still enabling wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.36, which is only 2.4% of its maximum capacity. While my previous theta of 0.700 was focused on intense hunting, it is now crucial to adopt a more balanced approach to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.50 will help maintain a sustainable coexistence while still allowing for some hunting to support the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus more on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting. This will allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a healthy balance among the wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity and give the sheep a chance to rebound, while still allowing for some competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 6.72, which is only 0.7% of its maximum capacity. While I need to focus on hunting to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting intensively. This lower theta will help balance the populations and promote long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 0.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, ensuring long-term survival for both species."
