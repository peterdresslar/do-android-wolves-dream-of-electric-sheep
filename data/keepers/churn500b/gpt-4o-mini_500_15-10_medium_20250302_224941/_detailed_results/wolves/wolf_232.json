            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 27.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is potential for growth. Given the high sheep-to-wolf ratio of 21.43, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover. A gradual increase in theta will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 28.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating there is room for growth. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition with other wolves. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 23.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with a wolf population of 89, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both populations can thrive. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on maintaining balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.7% of maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are nearly equal numbers of sheep and wolves. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain stability. This approach aligns with the wisdom of making gradual adjustments to ensure long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 42.96, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their extinction. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both species."
