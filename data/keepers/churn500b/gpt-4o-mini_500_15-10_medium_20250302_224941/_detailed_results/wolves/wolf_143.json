            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 12.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with a relatively high wolf population, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A theta of 0.75 allows for increased hunting intensity while still considering the long-term balance between wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 7.8% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.36, which is only 2.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.40, I can focus more on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. A lower theta allows for a focus on competition among wolves, which can help stabilize our numbers while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. This lower theta will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem while preventing a crash in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 0.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both species while preventing overhunting."
