            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 42.96, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. While my previous theta of 0.681 indicated a more aggressive hunting strategy, the current state suggests that a more moderate approach is necessary to allow the sheep to recover. This will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, as well as maintain a healthier balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help the sheep population rebound while allowing our own numbers to stabilize. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance."
