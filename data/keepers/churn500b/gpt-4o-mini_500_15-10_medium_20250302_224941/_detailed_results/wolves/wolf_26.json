            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain our wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover over time. A gradual approach is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.6% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking immediate depletion. A moderate approach will help maintain the balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring both can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 70.82, which is only 7.1% of its maximum capacity. While my previous theta of 0.650 was effective, it is important to reduce hunting intensity slightly to allow the sheep population to recover. A theta of 0.55 strikes a balance between hunting and allowing for sheep recovery, ensuring long-term sustainability for both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 49.30, which is only 4.9% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 3.4% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a significant competition for resources among wolves. By lowering my hunting intensity slightly, I can allow the sheep population to recover while still maintaining a focus on competition with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 2.5% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure and promote a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.20, which is only 1.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a slight hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A moderate increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while being mindful of the declining sheep numbers."
