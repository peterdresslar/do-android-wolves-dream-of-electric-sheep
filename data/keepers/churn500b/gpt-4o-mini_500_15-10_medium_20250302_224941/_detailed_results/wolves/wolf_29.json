        "explanations": [
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level (13.8% of maximum capacity), allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment balances the need for wolf reproduction while still considering the long-term sustainability of the sheep population. A gradual increase in theta helps maintain a dynamic equilibrium.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports both wolf reproduction and sheep recovery. This balance helps avoid depleting the sheep while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 95.94, which is only 9.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is an opportunity to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting. A theta of 0.45 strikes a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring that the sheep population can gradually increase, promoting long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 70.82, which is only 7.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover rather than intensifying our hunting. A lower theta will help balance our competition with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.31, which is only 3.4% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. This lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a significant competition for resources among wolves. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem."
