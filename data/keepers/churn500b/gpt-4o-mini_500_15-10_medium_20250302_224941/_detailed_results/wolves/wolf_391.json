            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 42.96, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a focus on competition with other wolves, a moderate theta value of 0.35 will help balance our needs without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both species by preventing further depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their extinction. Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover while also considering the current high wolf population, which is unsustainable if we continue to hunt intensely. A balanced approach is essential for the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity. Increasing hunting intensity could lead to the extinction of sheep, which would ultimately harm the wolf population as well. Maintaining a lower theta allows for the potential recovery of the sheep population while we focus on competition among wolves, ensuring a more sustainable ecosystem in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 0.0% of maximum capacity, indicating a severe depletion of their numbers. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows for the potential recovery of the sheep population, which is crucial for the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 0.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating a critical depletion. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting. This lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and give the sheep a chance to rebound.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.22, which means aggressive hunting could lead to their extinction. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while still competing with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and hunting intensity must be reduced to allow for recovery. A gradual increase from my previous theta will help prevent further depletion of the sheep while still allowing for some competition among wolves."
