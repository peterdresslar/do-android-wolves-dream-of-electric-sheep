            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level (17.4% of maximum capacity), which allows for some recovery. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low percentage of its maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This balance will support the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 120.10, which is only 12.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting without risking depletion. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still enabling the sheep population to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 7.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some sustainable hunting. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 43.14, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.36, which is only 2.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the sustainability of the sheep population. This balanced approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic equilibrium.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 1.5% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help the sheep population grow while also reducing competition among wolves as our numbers are currently high.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash."
