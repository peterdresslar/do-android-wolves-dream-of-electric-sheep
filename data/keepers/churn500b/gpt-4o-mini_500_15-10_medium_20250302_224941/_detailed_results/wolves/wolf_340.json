            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.7% of its maximum capacity, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. A theta of 0.4 reflects a balanced approach, enabling me to maintain a healthy wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover gradually.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 42.96, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach that balances the need for wolf sustenance with the necessity of sheep population recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity and give the sheep a chance to rebound, while also preventing overcompetition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover and increases the chances of sustainable coexistence. Given the current high wolf population, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.30, which means aggressive hunting could lead to their extinction. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can help the sheep recover while ensuring the wolf population remains stable. This gradual adjustment allows for a sustainable balance in the ecosystem."
