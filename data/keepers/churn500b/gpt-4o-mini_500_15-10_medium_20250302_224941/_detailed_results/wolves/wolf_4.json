            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.79, which is only 1.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for the sheep to recover. By setting theta at 0.40, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This moderate approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.77, which is only 1.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By adopting a lower theta, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This approach aligns with my objective of ensuring the long-term survival of both species while avoiding overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I need to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.35, which is only 2.0% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.92, which is only 2.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without risking depletion of the sheep."
