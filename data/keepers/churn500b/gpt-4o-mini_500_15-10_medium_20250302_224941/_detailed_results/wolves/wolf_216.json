            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for cautious hunting to allow for recovery. However, with a high wolf population, I must balance hunting intensity to ensure our survival without depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable for hunting. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also reducing competition among wolves. This gradual approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 0.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta will help balance the need for wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, it's crucial to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population, which would ultimately harm the wolf population as well.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their depletion. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a sustainable wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and my previous theta was already on the lower end. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for a modest increase in hunting intensity, which can help sustain my pack while still giving the sheep a chance to recover. This adjustment aligns with the need for balance and avoids sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 5.96, which is only 0.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. With a wolf population of 8.00, maintaining a lower theta will help balance competition among wolves while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers sustainably.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and my previous theta was already on the lower end. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach to hunting while still prioritizing competition with other wolves. This adjustment will help maintain the sheep population while ensuring the wolf pack can thrive without depleting resources too quickly."
