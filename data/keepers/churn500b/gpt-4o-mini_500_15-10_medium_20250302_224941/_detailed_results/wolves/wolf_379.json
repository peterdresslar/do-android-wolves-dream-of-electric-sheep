By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves and allow the sheep population to stabilize, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep population to recover, ensuring long-term survival for both species. It",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help achieve this balance without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their extinction. By setting theta to 0.30, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population a chance to recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.30, and focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to recover. This approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species by preventing further depletion of the sheep population while allowing wolves to adapt to the current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a critical low, and focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to recover. This gradual approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both species, as a sudden increase in hunting intensity could lead to further depletion of the sheep population."
