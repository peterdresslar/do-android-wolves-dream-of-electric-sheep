            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 43.14, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.25 reflects a cautious approach, focusing more on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population. This gradual adjustment helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.36, which is only 2.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to rebuild their numbers. Additionally, with a wolf population of 121, focusing on competition among wolves rather than aggressive hunting will help maintain our numbers while ensuring the sheep can thrive again. A gradual increase in theta can be considered later as the sheep population improves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I need to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low at 0.09. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover and increases the chances of sustainable coexistence. Given the current wolf population, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 6.72, which is only 0.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should remain low to allow the sheep to recover. However, since my previous theta was 0.300, I will make a small adjustment to 0.35 to slightly increase my hunting efforts while still prioritizing the sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. This will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a significant imbalance. By focusing on competition with other wolves at a lower theta, I can allow the sheep population to recover while ensuring the wolf population remains stable. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 0.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that aggressive hunting could lead to a severe depletion of sheep, jeopardizing both their survival and our long-term food source. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.4% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. This indicates that hunting intensity should remain low to allow the sheep population to recover. However, a slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 is warranted to ensure that the wolf population can sustain itself without depleting the sheep too quickly. A gradual approach will help maintain balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to rebound while also managing competition with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and ensures the long-term survival of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that we need to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will help maintain a balance between hunting and allowing the sheep to grow, while also considering the current wolf population. This gradual adjustment will support sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. Focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep population to recover while preventing overhunting, which is crucial for the long-term survival of both species. A gradual approach is necessary to maintain balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should remain low to allow the sheep to recover. However, with a wolf population of 12, I need to ensure that we are not competing too aggressively with each other, so a slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach that supports both wolf and sheep populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain balance and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 5.59, which is only 0.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting to support the wolf population. A small increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a gradual adjustment that aligns with the current ecosystem state."
