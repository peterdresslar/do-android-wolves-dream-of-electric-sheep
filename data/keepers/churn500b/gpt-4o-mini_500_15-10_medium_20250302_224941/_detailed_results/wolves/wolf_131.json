            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly, and this theta reflects a balanced approach.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low percentage of its maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both populations. This adjustment reflects a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring that we do not over-deplete the sheep while also allowing for some growth in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to ensure that both populations can thrive without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low at 7.8% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity slightly, allowing the sheep to recover while still competing with other wolves. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.36, which is only 2.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.13, which is only 1.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.30 to 0.35, I can maintain a balance between hunting and allowing the sheep population to stabilize, while also being mindful of the growing wolf population."
