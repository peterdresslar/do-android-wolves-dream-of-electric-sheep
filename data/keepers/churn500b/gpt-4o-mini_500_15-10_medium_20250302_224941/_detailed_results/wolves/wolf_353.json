            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. Focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep population to recover, ensuring long-term survival for both species. A gradual reduction in hunting intensity is necessary to avoid depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. A gradual adjustment will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while still competing with other wolves. This moderate approach will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 0.0% of maximum capacity, indicating a critical depletion. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows for the potential recovery of the sheep population while also considering the current high wolf population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims to ensure long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.26, which is only a fraction of the maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting. This lower theta will help the sheep population gradually increase, which is essential for the long-term survival of both species."
