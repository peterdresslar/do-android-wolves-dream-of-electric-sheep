            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. This lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By reducing my hunting intensity further, I can allow the sheep to replenish their numbers while also managing the competition among wolves. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity. Increasing hunting intensity could lead to the complete depletion of sheep, jeopardizing both species",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 0.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating a critical depletion of prey. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows for the potential recovery of the sheep population while also managing competition with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and prioritizes long-term sustainability over immediate gains."
