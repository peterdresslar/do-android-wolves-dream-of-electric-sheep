            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.6% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking immediate depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover over time.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 70.82, which is only 7.1% of its maximum capacity. While I want to maintain a healthy wolf population, I also recognize the need to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.60 allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep further. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 49.30, which is only 4.9% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of both populations. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.31, which is only 3.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing more on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 2.5% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure and promote a more sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.20, which is only 1.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity to 0.35, I can still maintain a focus on competition with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.3% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain a balance while avoiding overhunting."
