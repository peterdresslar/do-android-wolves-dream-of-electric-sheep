        "explanations": [
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 138.34, which is only 13.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.0% of maximum capacity, allowing for a gradual increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep. A moderate increase will support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.31, which is only 3.4% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. This will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.96, which is only 2.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while being mindful of the need for gradual adjustments.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 1.9% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, it is crucial to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population, which would ultimately harm the wolf population as well."
