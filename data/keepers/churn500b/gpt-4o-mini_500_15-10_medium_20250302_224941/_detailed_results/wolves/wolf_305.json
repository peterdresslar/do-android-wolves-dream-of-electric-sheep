        "explanations": [
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 23.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 2.61, I need to be cautious not to overhunt, as it could lead to a decline in the sheep population and ultimately harm the wolf population as well. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will allow for some growth in the wolf population while still giving the sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.7% of maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are nearly enough sheep for each wolf. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help sustain wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover gradually. This approach aligns with the wisdom of making small adjustments to maintain balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 42.96, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing competition with other wolves, which will help stabilize our numbers and promote a sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep population by reducing hunting intensity. This will allow the sheep to rebound while maintaining a stable wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.64, which is just 0.2% of its maximum capacity. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover and prevents further depletion of their numbers. Given the high wolf population, it is essential to focus on competition among wolves rather than aggressive hunting, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By lowering my hunting intensity further, I can allow the sheep to repopulate while also managing competition with other wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem."
