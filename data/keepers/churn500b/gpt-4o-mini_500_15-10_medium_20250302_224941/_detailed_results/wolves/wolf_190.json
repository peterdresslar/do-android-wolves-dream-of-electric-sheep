            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 43.14, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. While I need to maintain a balance, I can afford to increase my hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly. A theta of 0.65 allows for a moderate increase in hunting while still considering the long-term sustainability of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 8.03, which is only 0.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are struggling, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to their further decline. By adopting a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can allow the sheep population to stabilize and grow, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a significant competition for resources. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a bit more hunting to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.4% of its maximum capacity, which necessitates a focus on allowing the sheep to recover. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while also addressing the current imbalance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we are at risk of depleting their numbers further. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both species."
