By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can balance the need to hunt effectively while still conserving energy for future hunts. This adjustment allows me to adapt to the changing environment and improve my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the number of wolves has increased. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still contributing to the pack's needs. This balanced approach helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with an increase in the wolf population, competition for food will be fierce. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting may be more challenging. By increasing my intensity slightly from 0.40 to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion. This way, I can still contribute to my survival while being mindful of the dwindling prey."
