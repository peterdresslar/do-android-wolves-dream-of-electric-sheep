            "I chose this theta because while the sheep population has increased slightly, the number of wolves remains the same. By reducing my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being effective in hunting. This balance helps ensure my survival in a stable environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with the number of wolves remaining stable, I can afford to hunt with slightly less intensity. This allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success. A lower intensity also reduces the risk of overexertion and potential injury.",
            "I chose this theta because with an increase in the wolf population, competition for food will be higher. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival in a more competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population decreasing slightly and the number of wolves remaining stable, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a potentially dwindling food situation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 16 wolves competing for food, a moderate increase in hunting intensity will help me secure enough resources without overexerting myself. This balance allows me to be efficient while still considering the competition.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival in a stable environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased slightly, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the current number of sheep and wolves, a moderate increase in hunting intensity can help me secure enough food while still conserving energy. Since the number of wolves has remained stable, I need to be cautious and not overexert myself, as competition is still present. A theta of 0.40 allows me to balance between hunting effectively and ensuring my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can take advantage of the current situation without overexerting myself, ensuring I have enough energy for future hunts while still contributing to my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's efforts. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting more challenging. By increasing my intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with increasing wolf numbers."
