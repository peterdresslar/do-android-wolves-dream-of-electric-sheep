            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By adjusting my hunting intensity to a moderate level, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can maximize my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the wolf population is also declining. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition is less intense, allowing me to hunt with a bit more intensity without risking overexertion or attracting too much attention from other wolves. A theta of 0.60 strikes a balance between ensuring I contribute to the pack's survival while still being cautious.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the number of wolves, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves and potential failure. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct confrontation, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment."
