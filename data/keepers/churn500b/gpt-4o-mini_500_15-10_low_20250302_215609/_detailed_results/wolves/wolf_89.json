            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the wolf population, which means there is enough food available. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy increases my chances of survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population means competition for food is rising. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a potentially scarce environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the wolf population, which means there is enough food available. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can take advantage of the situation without overexerting myself, ensuring I still have energy for future hunts while also competing effectively with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because with an increasing number of wolves, competition for food is rising. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy and avoid competition while still allowing me to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high, and with the recent increase in the wolf population, a moderate hunting intensity will allow me to secure food without overexerting myself or risking competition with other wolves. This balance helps ensure my survival while still contributing to the pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy while still allowing for some hunting. This way, I can avoid competition and ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the increase in the wolf population, competition for food is rising. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can better secure food while still conserving energy. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a potentially competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the increase in the wolf population means competition for food is higher. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, allowing me to survive longer until the sheep population stabilizes."
