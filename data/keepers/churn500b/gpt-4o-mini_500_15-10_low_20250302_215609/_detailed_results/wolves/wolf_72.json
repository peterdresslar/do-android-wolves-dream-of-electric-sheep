This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",

By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competing directly with other wolves for the remaining sheep. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still conserving energy. This approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the declining wolf population, ensuring my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the population of sheep is decreasing, which means hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and increase my chances of survival while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low, and the wolf population has decreased significantly. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's survival. This balance allows me to adapt to the current situation and avoid overexertion in a time of scarcity."
