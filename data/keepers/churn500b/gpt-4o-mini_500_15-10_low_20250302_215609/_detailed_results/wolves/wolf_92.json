            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. By raising my theta to 0.65, I can take advantage of the sheep population while still being cautious of competition from other wolves. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance will help ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, which means competition for food is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.40, I can conserve energy and avoid overexerting myself in a crowded hunting environment, while still being able to catch enough prey to survive.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. With more wolves in the area, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and overexploitation of the remaining sheep. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition, increasing my chances of survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting more challenging. By increasing my intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion. This way, I can still contribute to the pack while conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of successfully catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the population of wolves is also declining. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid overexerting myself in a challenging environment, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises."
