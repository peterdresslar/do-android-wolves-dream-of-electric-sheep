            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting more challenging. With an increase in the wolf population, competition for food is higher. By lowering my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a more competitive environment. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt, allowing me to adapt to the changing conditions and increase my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, but the wolf population has decreased. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still contributing to the hunt. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. With fewer wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 8 wolves competing for food, a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This balance increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself."
