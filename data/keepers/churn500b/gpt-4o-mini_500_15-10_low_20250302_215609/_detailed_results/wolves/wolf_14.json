            "I chose this theta because with an increasing number of wolves, competition for food is rising. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a potentially scarce environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can balance my energy expenditure with the need to secure food without overexerting myself, which could be risky given the rising number of wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can better secure my share of the sheep while still being mindful of the need to conserve energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased significantly, which means competition for food is higher. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting more competitive. With more wolves around, a moderate intensity will allow me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This balance increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, indicating a potential scarcity of food. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and overexploitation of the remaining sheep. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and wait for a better opportunity when the sheep population stabilizes.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and reduce competition for the remaining sheep. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current environment while still ensuring my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, which means hunting intensity needs to be balanced. A moderate intensity of 0.50 allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive in securing food, especially since other wolves are also hunting at maximum intensity.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low, and the competition among wolves is high due to their recent decrease. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the hunt when opportunities arise. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment."
