            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, which means there is enough food available. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.40, I can take advantage of the situation without overexerting myself, allowing for a sustainable approach to hunting while still ensuring my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, with the recent decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I have enough energy to survive while still contributing to the pack's success. A moderate intensity allows me to be effective without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. By increasing my intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the higher prey availability while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself, especially since the number of wolves has remained constant.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 14 wolves competing for food, a slightly increased hunting intensity will improve my chances of securing a meal without overexerting myself. This balance allows me to adapt to the current situation while still being cautious.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a sustainable hunt without overexerting myself. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, ensuring my survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity. By reducing my intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still having a reasonable chance of catching prey.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased slightly, which presents a good opportunity for hunting. However, with the number of wolves remaining constant, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I have enough energy for future hunts while still being competitive. A theta of 0.60 allows me to be more efficient without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because with 35.26 sheep and 14 wolves, the competition for food is still significant. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased slightly, which means food is becoming scarcer. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This allows me to adapt to the current situation and increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
