            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, which means there is enough food available. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to catch prey when needed.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because with the increase in the wolf population, competition for food is likely to intensify. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can better secure food for myself while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a growing pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts. This strategy increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy and avoid competition while still allowing for opportunistic hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population decreasing, I need to increase my hunting intensity to ensure I can secure enough food for survival. However, I also want to avoid overexerting myself, as the wolf population remains stable, and I need to conserve energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential failure. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at a higher intensity will increase my chances of catching prey while still being cautious not to overexert myself, given the recent increase in wolf population."
