            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and I want to balance the need for food with the risk of overhunting. By increasing my intensity slightly, I can contribute to the hunt without depleting resources too quickly, ensuring my survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the number of wolves suggests more competition for food. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure enough food while conserving energy and avoiding overexertion. This strategy allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics of the pack and the available prey.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the current situation without overexerting myself, as the competition among wolves is increasing. This balance helps ensure my survival while still allowing for a successful hunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with the number of wolves remaining constant, competition for food will be higher. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with others for the remaining sheep. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment."
