            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the increase in wolves means competition for food is higher. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can better compete with other wolves for the remaining sheep while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance will help ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with the wolf population remaining the same, I need to increase my hunting intensity to secure enough food for survival. A theta of 0.75 allows me to hunt effectively while still conserving some energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, indicating a scarcity of food. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This approach balances the need for survival with the current low availability of prey.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low, and the competition among wolves is high due to their recent decrease. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the population of sheep is relatively low, and the number of wolves has decreased significantly. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased slightly, indicating a potential for more food. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests competition is fierce. By choosing a moderate intensity, I can balance the need to hunt effectively while conserving energy and avoiding overexertion, which could lead to unnecessary risks."
