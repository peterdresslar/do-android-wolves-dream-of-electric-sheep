            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid competition while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making hunting more competitive. By increasing my intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of securing food while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion, which is crucial for my survival in a challenging environment. A lower theta allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low, and the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of securing food while still being mindful of the competition from other wolves. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively low, and the number of wolves has decreased significantly. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, with the recent decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still secure food while avoiding overexertion that could lead to vulnerability. A moderate increase in intensity allows me to take advantage of the situation without risking too much energy."
