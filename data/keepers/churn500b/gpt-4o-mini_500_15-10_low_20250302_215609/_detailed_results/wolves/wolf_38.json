With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and reduce competition for the remaining sheep. This balanced approach increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",

With fewer wolves, I can afford to hunt at a lower intensity while still ensuring my survival. This allows me to conserve energy and avoid overexertion, especially since the sheep population has only slightly increased."
