            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still allowing for a sustainable hunt. This approach increases my chances of survival in a growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, providing a better opportunity for hunting. By increasing my intensity to 0.65, I can take advantage of this situation while still conserving energy in case the sheep population fluctuates. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and increase my chances of survival while still participating in the hunt. This balanced approach allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential failure. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and wait for better opportunities while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting may be less rewarding. By adjusting my hunting intensity to a moderate level, I can conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a potentially less fruitful environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the number of sheep decreasing, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food while conserving energy. A slightly higher intensity than my previous choice allows me to be more competitive without exhausting myself too quickly, especially since other wolves are also hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can maximize my chances of catching enough prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly while the number of wolves has decreased. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This balance helps ensure my survival in a changing environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, but the wolf population has decreased. This suggests that hunting at maximum intensity may lead to competition with other wolves for the same prey. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.40, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the hunt. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population increasing, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to balance the need for food while conserving energy. This way, I can adapt to the changing environment and ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests competition is fierce. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can take advantage of the abundant prey while still being cautious about the risks posed by other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 11 wolves, hunting at a slightly reduced intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment."
