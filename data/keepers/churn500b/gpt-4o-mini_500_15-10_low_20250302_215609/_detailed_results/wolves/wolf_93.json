            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, which means competition for food is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.30, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased significantly, which means competition for food is higher. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance my energy expenditure while still being effective in hunting. This allows me to conserve energy for future hunts and increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and I need to increase my hunting intensity to secure enough food for survival. With other wolves also hunting, a slightly higher intensity will help me compete effectively while still managing my energy.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with the wolf population remaining constant, a moderate hunting intensity will allow me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of successfully hunting while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a situation where food is becoming scarcer.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to ensure sustainability. With fewer sheep, a lower intensity will help maintain my energy reserves and avoid overexploitation of the remaining prey, while still allowing for some hunting to meet my needs."
