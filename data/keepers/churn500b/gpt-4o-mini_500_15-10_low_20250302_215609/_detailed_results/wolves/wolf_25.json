            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.65, I can better secure my share of the dwindling sheep population while still being cautious not to overexert myself and risk injury or depletion of energy.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, competition for food is high, and a lower intensity will help conserve energy while still allowing me to hunt effectively. This balance increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment."
