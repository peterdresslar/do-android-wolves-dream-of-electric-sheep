            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. By increasing my intensity slightly, I can still contribute to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population decreasing, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food while conserving energy. A moderate intensity of 0.50 allows me to be effective without overexerting myself, especially since the competition with other wolves remains constant.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population decreasing, I need to increase my hunting intensity to ensure I can secure enough food for survival. However, I also want to be cautious not to overexert myself, as the number of wolves remains the same, and competition for food is still present.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, but the wolf population has decreased. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still taking advantage of the available prey. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, indicating a potential for more food. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests competition is fierce. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can take advantage of the sheep while still being cautious about overexerting myself in a dwindling pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with the number of wolves remaining stable, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population increasing, a slightly higher hunting intensity will improve my chances of securing food without overexerting myself. Since the number of wolves has remained constant, I need to balance my efforts to ensure I can compete effectively while also conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 12 wolves competing for food, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective. This balance increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the number of wolves. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to catch enough food to survive. This approach allows me to adapt to the current situation and ensure my long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because with 38.21 sheep and 11 wolves, the prey-to-predator ratio is favorable. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can take advantage of the available food while still conserving energy and avoiding overexertion, which is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the number of wolves suggests a higher competition for food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.65, I can better secure my share of the sheep while still being mindful of the sustainability of the prey population.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population means competition for food is rising. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of successfully catching sheep while still being mindful of conserving energy. This balance is crucial for my survival in a more competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased slightly, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, which means hunting intensity should be moderated to ensure sustainability. With more wolves around, a lower intensity may help me avoid competition and still secure enough food without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased slightly, and with the number of wolves remaining the same, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still secure enough food without overexerting myself. A theta of 0.60 allows me to be more efficient in my hunting while still being competitive with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can maximize my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population decreasing and the number of wolves increasing, hunting at a slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity from 0.60 to 0.75, I can improve my chances of catching enough prey while still being mindful of the competition with other wolves. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because with the current number of sheep decreasing and wolves remaining the same, a slightly lower hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. This way, I can adapt to the changing environment and ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
