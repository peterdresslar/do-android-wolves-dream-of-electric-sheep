            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the wolf population, which means there is enough food available. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the situation without overexerting myself, allowing for a sustainable approach to hunting while still ensuring my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has slightly decreased, indicating that food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion, ensuring my survival while still being mindful of the competition from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased significantly, which means competition for food is higher. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's efforts. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a more competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy while still allowing for some hunting opportunities. This balance increases my chances of survival in a competitive environment."
