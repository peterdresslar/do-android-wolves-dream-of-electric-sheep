        "explanations": [
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased significantly, which means competition for food is higher. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively when necessary. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a crowded environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the increase in the wolf population, competition for food is likely to intensify. By adjusting my hunting intensity to a moderate level, I can balance the need to secure food while conserving energy and avoiding overexertion. This approach allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics of the pack and the decreasing sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making them more scarce. With more wolves around, I need to increase my hunting intensity to ensure I can catch enough food for survival. A theta of 0.70 allows me to be more competitive without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable given the current prey availability. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's needs, ensuring my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the competition among wolves is high with a recent decline in their population. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexerting myself in a challenging environment, while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise."
