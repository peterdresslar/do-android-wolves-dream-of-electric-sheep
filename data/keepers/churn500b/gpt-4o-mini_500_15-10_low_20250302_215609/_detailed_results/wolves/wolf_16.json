            "I chose this theta because while the sheep population has increased, the number of wolves has also risen significantly. By lowering my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still contributing to the pack's overall success. This balance helps ensure my survival in a growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means food is becoming scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and overexploitation of the remaining sheep. By lowering my intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and avoid drawing too much attention while still contributing to the pack's success.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making them a scarcer resource. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can take advantage of the situation while still being cautious, as the number of wolves has increased as well. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with the number of wolves remaining the same, hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's efforts, allowing for a more balanced approach to survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, which means there is less food available. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to survive longer while waiting for the sheep population to recover."
