            "I chose this theta because with 15 sheep and 10 wolves, the competition for food is high. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of successfully catching prey while still conserving some energy. This balance will help ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population increasing and the number of wolves remaining constant, a lower hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition is less intense. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can take advantage of the abundant food while still being cautious, ensuring my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, but the wolf population has decreased. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy and reduce competition with other wolves while still taking advantage of the available prey. This balance helps ensure my survival in a fluctuating environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, which means there is more food available. However, with the number of wolves remaining the same, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and overhunting. A slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, ensuring my survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. With the decrease in the wolf population, a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive in securing food. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with 21.33 sheep available, there's a good opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. By increasing my intensity slightly from my previous 0.50, I can take advantage of the sheep population while still conserving energy for future hunts, especially since the number of wolves remains stable. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment."
