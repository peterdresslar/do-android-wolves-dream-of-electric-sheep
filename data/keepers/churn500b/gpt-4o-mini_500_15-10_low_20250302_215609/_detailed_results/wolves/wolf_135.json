            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and I want to balance my hunting efforts to ensure I can still catch enough food while not overexerting myself. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy and adapt to the increasing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the wolf population, which means there is enough food available. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.40, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are likely to hunt at maximum intensity. This strategy increases my chances of survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population increasing and the number of wolves remaining the same, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still secure enough food while avoiding overexertion. A moderate intensity of 0.50 allows me to be efficient without risking depletion of resources or attracting too much attention from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased significantly, which means competition for food is higher. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if necessary. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a crowded environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of catching enough food while still conserving energy, as the competition with other wolves remains constant.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that food is becoming scarcer. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my intensity slightly to 0.60, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive situation with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can maximize my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the competition among wolves is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's survival. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and increase my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy may increase my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, and with fewer wolves around, I can afford to hunt with a bit more intensity while still being cautious. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a potentially competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is increasing, which means there is more food available. However, with the number of wolves remaining constant, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food without overexerting myself. A theta of 0.75 allows me to be competitive while conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 13 wolves competing for food, a slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, but the wolf population has decreased. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.45, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current dynamics, ensuring my survival without overexerting myself in a potentially competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with 33.50 sheep and 12 wolves, the competition for food is high. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of catching prey without overexerting myself, which is crucial for my survival. This balance allows me to remain efficient while still being mindful of the limited resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 12 wolves competing for food, a moderate increase in hunting intensity will allow me to secure enough resources while avoiding overexertion. This balance helps ensure my survival without risking depletion of the sheep population too quickly."
