            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. This balance increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the wolf population is also declining. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who might be hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey while still ensuring my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the population of sheep is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and I need to balance my energy expenditure with the need to secure food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can be more effective in hunting while still conserving some energy in case the situation worsens. This way, I can adapt to the decreasing trend of the wolf population and ensure my survival."
