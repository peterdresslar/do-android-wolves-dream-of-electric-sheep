A theta of 0.40 allows me to hunt effectively while conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the decreased number of wolves. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the available prey while still being cautious, as the competition among wolves is fierce. A moderate intensity allows me to balance my energy expenditure and increase my chances of a successful hunt without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because with a stable number of wolves and a slight increase in sheep, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can secure enough food without overexerting myself. A theta of 0.65 allows me to be competitive while conserving energy for future hunts, especially since other wolves are also hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and I want to increase my chances of a successful hunt while still conserving energy. A theta of 0.75 allows me to be more efficient than the maximum intensity, which is important given the stable number of wolves. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",

By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy and reduce competition with other wolves, while still taking advantage of the available prey. This balance increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, which means there is a good opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. By increasing my intensity slightly from my previous theta, I can increase my chances of a successful hunt while still conserving energy for future needs.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased slightly, indicating a potential scarcity of food.

This balanced approach helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",

A slightly higher intensity than my previous choice allows me to be competitive without exhausting my resources too quickly.",
