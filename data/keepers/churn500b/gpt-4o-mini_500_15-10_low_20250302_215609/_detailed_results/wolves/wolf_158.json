            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a more sustainable hunting approach. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still contributing to the pack's success.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 12 wolves competing for food, a slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This balance increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the hunt. This balance allows me to survive in a crowded environment without risking depletion of resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased slightly, and with the number of wolves remaining constant, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still secure enough food without overexerting myself. A theta of 0.75 allows me to hunt effectively while conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success. This way, I can adapt to the changing conditions and ensure my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making them scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, ensuring my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy, as I don",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the competition among wolves is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and reduce the risk of overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. With the recent decrease in the wolf population, a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in securing food for survival. This balance is crucial in ensuring I can thrive in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased slightly, indicating a potential for more food. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition is fierce. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can capitalize on the available prey while still being cautious, as I need to ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the population of sheep has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. With the recent decrease in the wolf population, a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's survival.
