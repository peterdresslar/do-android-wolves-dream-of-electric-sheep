            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and the increase in wolves means competition for food is rising. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival in a changing environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and reduce competition for limited prey. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential failure. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, balancing the need for food with the risk of overexertion.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with the wolf population also declining, hunting at a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves. By being more strategic and patient, I can increase my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is increasing. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still being effective in catching prey. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is low and the competition among wolves is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, which presents a better hunting opportunity. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition is less intense, allowing me to hunt at a moderate intensity without risking overexertion or attracting too much attention from other wolves. A theta of 0.50 balances my need for food with the need to conserve energy and avoid potential conflicts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, but the wolf population has decreased significantly. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment."
