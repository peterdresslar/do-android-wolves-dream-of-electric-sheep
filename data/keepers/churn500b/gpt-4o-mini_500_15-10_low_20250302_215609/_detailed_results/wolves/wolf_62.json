By lowering my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively. This way, I can adapt to the changing dynamics and ensure my survival without risking too much in a crowded hunting environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making food scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion. This allows me to be more efficient in hunting while still conserving energy for potential future hunts, especially with the rising number of wolves."
