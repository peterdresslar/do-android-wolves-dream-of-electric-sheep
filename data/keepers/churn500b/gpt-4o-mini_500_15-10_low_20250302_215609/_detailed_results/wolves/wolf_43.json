            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, but the wolf population has decreased significantly. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still taking advantage of the available prey. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, with the recent decrease in the wolf population, I need to be cautious and not overexert myself. A moderate intensity allows me to hunt effectively while conserving energy for future needs.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, but the wolf population has decreased. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still taking advantage of the available prey. This balance helps ensure my survival in a fluctuating environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the decrease in the wolf population, hunting at a slightly higher intensity than my previous choice allows me to compete better for food while still being cautious. The increase in sheep means there is more food available, so a moderate increase in intensity can help ensure my survival without risking overexertion."
