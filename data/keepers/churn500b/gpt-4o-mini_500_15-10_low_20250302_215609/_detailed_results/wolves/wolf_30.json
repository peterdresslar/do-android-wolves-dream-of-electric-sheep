            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's efforts. This balance allows me to survive in a challenging environment where resources are becoming scarcer.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with an increase in the wolf population, competition for food will be higher. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This strategy allows me to adapt to the changing environment and ensure my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, which means food is becoming scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential failure. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt, increasing my chances of survival."
