            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and less food for everyone. By choosing a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, ensuring my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting might be less fruitful if I go all out. By increasing my intensity slightly from my previous theta, I can still be competitive with other wolves while conserving energy and adapting to the changing environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with the number of wolves remaining constant, hunting at maximum intensity may lead to competition with other wolves for fewer sheep. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and increase my chances of survival while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting may be less fruitful. By increasing my intensity slightly to 0.70, I can take advantage of the remaining sheep while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, but the wolf population has decreased. A moderate hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still taking advantage of the available prey. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition is less intense. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can take advantage of the abundant food while still being cautious, as the overall trend indicates a decline in wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, but the wolf population has decreased. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still taking advantage of the available prey. This balanced approach helps ensure my survival in a changing environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, indicating a good opportunity for hunting.

This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the competition among wolves is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the wolf population is also declining. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low, and the competition among wolves is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and I need to balance my energy expenditure with the need to hunt effectively. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive in the hunt, especially since other wolves are also struggling.",
            "I chose this theta because with the current number of sheep and wolves, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to balance the need for food while minimizing competition with other wolves. By increasing my intensity slightly from my previous theta, I can take advantage of the sheep population without overexerting myself or risking injury in a high-stakes hunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, but the wolf population has decreased. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy and reduce competition with other wolves, while still taking advantage of the available prey. This balance increases my chances of survival in a changing environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with 31.63 sheep and only 15 wolves, there is a decent amount of prey available.
