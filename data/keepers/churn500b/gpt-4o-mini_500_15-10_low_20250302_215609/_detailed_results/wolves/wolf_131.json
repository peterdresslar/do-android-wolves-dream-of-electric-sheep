            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, which presents a good opportunity for hunting. However, with the number of wolves remaining the same, I need to be cautious not to overexert myself and risk depleting resources too quickly. A moderate intensity allows me to balance the need for food while ensuring I can sustain myself in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the increased number of wolves. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves for the limited prey. This strategy allows me to survive longer while waiting for a better opportunity.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting. By increasing my intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the higher prey availability while still being cautious, as the number of wolves remains the same. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still contributing to the pack's overall success. This strategy allows me to survive longer in a situation where resources are plentiful but competition is increasing.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and I want to increase my chances of a successful hunt without overexerting myself. By raising my intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the current situation while still conserving energy for future hunts, especially since the number of wolves remains stable.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the population of sheep has decreased, making them a scarcer resource. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can maximize my chances of catching prey while still being mindful of the increased competition from other wolves. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making food scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still being mindful of the increased competition from other wolves. A theta of 0.75 balances the need for food with the risk of overexertion.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. This strategy increases my chances of survival by avoiding competition for scarce resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, and the number of wolves has increased. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves for the dwindling sheep. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves in the area, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy and avoid competition while still allowing for opportunistic hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey without overexerting myself, as the other wolves are still hunting at maximum intensity. This balance allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating less food availability. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of catching enough food while still conserving energy. This balance is crucial for my survival, especially with the current competition from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a sustainable hunt without overexerting myself. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, who may be hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a declining wolf population."
