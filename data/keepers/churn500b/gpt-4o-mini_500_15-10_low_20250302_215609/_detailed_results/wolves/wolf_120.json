By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey without overexerting myself, which could lead to exhaustion or failure. A moderate approach allows me to adapt to the changing environment while still being cautious.",
            "I chose this theta because the population of sheep is relatively low, and the number of wolves has decreased significantly. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of securing food without overexerting myself or risking competition with other wolves. A moderate approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity while still being cautious.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while conserving energy, as the sheep population is still relatively high. This approach allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself, ensuring my survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the decreased number of wolves. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still taking advantage of the available prey. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests competition is less intense, allowing me to hunt at a moderate intensity without risking overexertion or attracting too much attention from other wolves. A theta of 0.50 balances the need for food with the need for caution.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, indicating a potential for a successful hunt. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition is lower, allowing me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. A moderate intensity will help ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
