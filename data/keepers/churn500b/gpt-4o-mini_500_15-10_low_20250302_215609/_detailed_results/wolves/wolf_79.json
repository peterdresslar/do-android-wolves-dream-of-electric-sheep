            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and reduce competition for food while still allowing me to hunt effectively.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the wolf population is also declining. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can conserve energy and increase my chances of survival while still contributing to the pack's efforts. This balance allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and avoid overexertion.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the number of wolves, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves for the same prey. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's survival. This balanced approach allows me to adapt to the current situation and increases my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, which presents a good opportunity for hunting. However, with the recent decrease in the wolf population, I need to be cautious and not overexert myself. A theta of 0.65 allows me to hunt effectively while still conserving energy and ensuring my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. With the recent decrease in the wolf population, a moderate intensity will allow me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, ensuring my survival in a competitive environment."
