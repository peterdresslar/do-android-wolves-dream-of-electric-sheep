            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and I want to avoid competing too aggressively with my pack for food. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being part of the hunt, ensuring my survival without drawing too much attention.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. This way, I can adapt to the changing environment and increase my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting may be more challenging. By increasing my intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion, ensuring I remain competitive without exhausting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who may be hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and increases my chances of survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the population of wolves has decreased significantly, and hunting at a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's survival. With sheep numbers increasing, a balanced approach can help ensure I have enough resources without overexerting myself."
