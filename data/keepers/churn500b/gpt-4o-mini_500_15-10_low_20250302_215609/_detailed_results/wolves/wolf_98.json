            "I chose this theta because with an increase in the wolf population, competition for food will be higher. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while conserving energy and avoiding overexertion. This strategy allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics and ensure my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, it's wise to conserve energy and avoid competition. A lower intensity will help me survive while still allowing for opportunistic hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and with my previous theta of 0.30, I was not maximizing my hunting potential. Increasing my intensity to 0.45 allows me to take advantage of the current sheep numbers while still being cautious, as the wolf population remains stable. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is low compared to the number of wolves, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves and potential overhunting. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid drawing attention while still contributing to the pack's survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition is fierce. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still being cautious about the risks posed by other wolves."
