            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can take advantage of the current situation without overexerting myself, allowing for a balance between ensuring my survival and not depleting the sheep population too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased significantly, which means competition for food is higher. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively when necessary. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a crowded environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can better secure my share of the dwindling sheep population while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can better secure my share of the dwindling sheep population while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and hunting at full intensity may not be sustainable given the current numbers. By reducing my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and ensure my survival while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and increase my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with the wolf population also declining, it may be wise to conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves. A lower hunting intensity allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises."
