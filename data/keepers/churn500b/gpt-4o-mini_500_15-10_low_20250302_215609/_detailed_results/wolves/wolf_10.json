            "I chose this theta because with an increase in the number of wolves, competition for food is rising. By lowering my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival in a more competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 7 wolves competing for food, a slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This strategy helps ensure my survival by balancing the need for food with the risk of overexertion.",
            "I chose this theta because with an increasing number of wolves, competition for food is rising. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success. This strategy allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics and ensure my survival without risking depletion of resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, I need to increase my hunting intensity to compete effectively for the limited resources. A theta of 0.60 allows me to balance the need for food while conserving some energy for future hunts."
