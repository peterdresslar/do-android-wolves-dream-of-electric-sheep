            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population means competition for food is rising. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can better secure my share of the dwindling sheep population while still being mindful of conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a competitive environment. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's survival. This balanced approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the declining wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the wolf population is still relatively high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. With the recent decrease in the wolf population, a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive in securing food."
