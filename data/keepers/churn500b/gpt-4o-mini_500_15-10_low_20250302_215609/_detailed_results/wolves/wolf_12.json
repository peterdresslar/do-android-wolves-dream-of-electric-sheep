            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and I need to balance my energy expenditure with the risk of competing with other wolves. A moderate intensity allows me to hunt effectively while conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. By choosing a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still being competitive with other wolves. This balance helps ensure my survival in a stable environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity. By increasing my intensity slightly from my previous theta, I can take advantage of the increased sheep population while still being cautious of competition from other wolves. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in both sheep and wolves indicates a more competitive environment. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves while still contributing to the pack's overall success. This balance helps ensure my survival in a growing population.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population means more competition for the available sheep. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.65, I can still hunt effectively while conserving energy and reducing the risk of overexertion. This balance helps ensure my survival in a more competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests that competition for food is rising. By lowering my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance may help ensure my survival in a more competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, competition for food is higher, so a lower intensity will help conserve energy while still allowing for some hunting. This balance increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with the recent increase in the wolf population, competition for food will be fierce. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise. This strategy allows me to adapt to the changing environment and ensure my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to hunt effectively while still conserving energy, as the wolf population is increasing and competition for food may become fiercer.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the declining wolf population."
