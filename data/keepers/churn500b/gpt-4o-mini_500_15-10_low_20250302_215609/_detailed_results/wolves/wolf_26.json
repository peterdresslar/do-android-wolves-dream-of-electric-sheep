By increasing my intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of a successful hunt while still conserving energy for future needs. This balance is crucial given the rising number of wolves competing for the same prey.",

With more wolves around, competition for food is high, so a lower intensity will help conserve energy while still allowing for some hunting. This balance increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment."
