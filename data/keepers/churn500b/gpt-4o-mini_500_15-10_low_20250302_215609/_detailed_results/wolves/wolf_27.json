            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making food scarcer. With an increase in the wolf population, competition for food is higher. A moderate hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolf populations indicates a need for a more balanced approach to hunting. By increasing my intensity to 0.50, I can still contribute to the hunt without overexerting myself, allowing for a sustainable approach that considers the declining prey and competition from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the wolf population is also declining. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who may be hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to survive longer while waiting for a more favorable situation."
