            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. This strategy increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting more competitive. By adjusting my intensity to 0.5, I can conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This balance allows me to adapt to the changing environment and increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low, and the competition among wolves is high due to their recent decrease. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid drawing attention while still contributing to the pack's survival. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the increased competition.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still conserving energy, as hunting at maximum intensity may lead to overexertion and risk of failure. This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the declining wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, but the wolf population has decreased significantly. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competing aggressively with other wolves, which may help ensure my survival in this challenging environment."
