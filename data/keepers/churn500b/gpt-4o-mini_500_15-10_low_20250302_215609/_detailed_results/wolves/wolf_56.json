A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt, especially as the wolf population is increasing.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less predictable. With more wolves around, a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive in the hunt. This balance increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting more competitive among wolves. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.65, I can improve my chances of securing food while still being mindful of the risks posed by other wolves. This balance allows me to adapt to the changing environment and ensure my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still contributing to the pack"
