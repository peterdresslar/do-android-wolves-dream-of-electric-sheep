            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 13 wolves, hunting at full intensity may lead to competition and overexploitation of resources. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves while still taking advantage of the available prey.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.40, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid attracting attention from other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively when necessary. This balance helps ensure my survival in a crowded environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 46.38, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity.

            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, which presents a good opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition is less intense. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can take advantage of the available prey while still being cautious, as the overall trend indicates a decline in wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 17 wolves competing for food, a moderate increase in hunting intensity will help me secure enough resources without overexerting myself. This balance allows me to remain efficient while still being cautious, as the wolf population has not changed.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 14 wolves, competition for food is present but not overwhelming. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 14 wolves competing for food, increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75 allows me to take advantage of the abundance while still conserving some energy. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. By lowering my intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and still compete effectively with other wolves, who are likely hunting at maximum intensity. This balance helps ensure my survival while adapting to the current situation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased slightly, indicating a good opportunity for hunting. However, with the number of wolves remaining the same, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough prey while avoiding overexertion. A theta of 0.75 allows me to be competitive without risking depletion of my energy reserves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased slightly, indicating a good food source. However, with the number of wolves remaining the same, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I have enough energy for future hunts while still being competitive. A slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 14 wolves competing for food, I need to increase my hunting intensity to secure enough resources for survival. A theta of 0.75 allows me to be aggressive enough to catch prey while still conserving some energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased slightly, and the wolf population has increased. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still contributing to the hunt. This balance helps ensure my survival in a changing environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the number of wolves. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if needed.
