            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the growing sheep population while still being cautious, as other wolves are also hunting. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in both sheep and wolves suggests a competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while conserving energy, allowing me to adapt to the rising wolf population without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success. This strategy allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics and ensure my survival in a crowded environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With an increase in the wolf population, competition for food will be higher. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of catching enough food while still being mindful of the risks of overexertion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.45, I can conserve energy and avoid competing too aggressively with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment."
