            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By reducing my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival in a more competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and less food for me. By lowering my intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt, allowing me to adapt to the changing environment and ensure my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy while still allowing for a chance to hunt effectively without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can better compete for food while still conserving energy. This balance may help ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a dwindling prey situation."
