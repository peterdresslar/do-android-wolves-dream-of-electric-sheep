            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion and competition with other wolves. This approach allows me to be more strategic in my hunting while still ensuring I have enough energy to survive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting may be less rewarding. By increasing my intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the remaining sheep while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the wolf population is also declining. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and resources while still contributing to the pack's survival. This approach allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself, which is crucial for my long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in the wolf population suggests increased competition for food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can better secure my share of the sheep while still being cautious, as overexerting myself could lead to exhaustion or injury. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, with the recent decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food without overexerting myself and risking injury or exhaustion. A theta of 0.75 allows me to hunt effectively while being mindful of the competition and my own survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. With the recent decrease in the wolf population, a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's survival. This balance helps ensure I can hunt effectively without risking my own safety.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, which presents a good opportunity for hunting. However, with the number of wolves remaining the same, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can secure enough food without overexerting myself or risking competition with other wolves. A theta of 0.65 allows me to be more efficient while still being cautious.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting. However, with the recent decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food while avoiding overexertion. A theta of 0.75 allows me to be more efficient without risking too much energy.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 10 wolves competing for food, a slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This strategy increases my chances of survival by not overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population increasing and the number of wolves remaining stable, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a potentially competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with 34.36 sheep and 10 wolves, the competition for food is significant. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly to 0.60, I can improve my chances of securing a meal without overexerting myself, which is crucial for my survival. This balance allows me to adapt to the current situation while still being mindful of the risks involved.",
