            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with the wolf population also declining, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to overexploitation of the remaining sheep. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and adapt to the changing environment while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the dwindling sheep population while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself."
