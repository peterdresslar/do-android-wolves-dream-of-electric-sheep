By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, allowing me to hunt more effectively in the future when the conditions may be more favorable.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making them a scarcer resource. With the increase in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food without overexerting myself. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential failure. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment."
