            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, I need to be cautious and conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. A moderate intensity allows me to adapt to the changing environment and ensure my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making hunting less predictable. By increasing my intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion, especially with more wolves around. This way, I can still secure enough resources while being cautious.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making them scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and less food for me. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition while still being able to hunt when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with the number of wolves remaining constant, competition for food is likely to increase. By adjusting my hunting intensity to a moderate level, I can balance the need to hunt effectively while conserving energy and avoiding overexertion in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexerting myself in a situation where food is scarce. This strategy allows me to survive longer while waiting for better opportunities.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in the wolf population suggests that hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential overhunting. By choosing a moderate intensity, I can still contribute to the pack's survival while ensuring I have enough energy to sustain myself in case of future challenges."
