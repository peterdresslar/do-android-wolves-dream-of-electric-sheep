            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low, and with the recent decrease in both sheep and wolves, I need to balance the need for food with the risk of overexerting myself. A slightly higher intensity than before (0.51) will help me secure food while still being cautious.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With fewer sheep, I need to conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also hunting at maximum intensity. A lower theta allows me to hunt more strategically and increase my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, which presents a better opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests competition is high, so I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch prey while conserving energy and avoiding overexertion.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, but the wolf population has decreased. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competing too aggressively with other wolves, which may help ensure my survival in this changing environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests competition is still present. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can take advantage of the sheep while still being cautious about the risks posed by other wolves."
