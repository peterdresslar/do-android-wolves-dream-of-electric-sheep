            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexerting myself in a situation where food is scarce. This strategy allows me to survive longer while waiting for a more favorable opportunity.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while also being cautious not to overexert myself, given the declining wolf population. This approach allows me to adapt to the situation and ensure my survival without risking too much energy.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests competition is fierce. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the available prey while still being cautious about the risks posed by other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. With the wolf population decreasing, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's survival. This balance helps ensure I can hunt effectively without risking injury or depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, but the wolf population has decreased. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who may be more aggressive. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and ensure my survival while still taking advantage of the available prey.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, with the number of wolves remaining the same, I need to balance my hunting intensity to avoid competition and ensure my survival. A moderate increase in intensity allows me to take advantage of the available prey without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because with the decrease in the wolf population and the increase in sheep, there is a greater chance of successfully hunting without overexerting myself. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, ensuring my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the number of sheep increasing and the wolf population stable, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a potentially competitive environment.",
