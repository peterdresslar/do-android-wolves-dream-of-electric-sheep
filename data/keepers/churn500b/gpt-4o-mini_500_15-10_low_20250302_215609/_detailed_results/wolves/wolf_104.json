            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts. This way, I can adapt to the changing environment and increase my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, with the recent decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I don",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is increasing, which presents a good opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition is fierce. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can take advantage of the abundant prey while still being cautious about the risks posed by other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition is lower, allowing me to hunt with slightly less intensity while still ensuring I can secure enough food for survival. A theta of 0.60 balances the need for food with the risk of overexertion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with the number of wolves remaining constant, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a potentially competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, which presents a good opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition is tougher. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.65, I can take advantage of the available prey while still being cautious about the risks posed by other wolves."
