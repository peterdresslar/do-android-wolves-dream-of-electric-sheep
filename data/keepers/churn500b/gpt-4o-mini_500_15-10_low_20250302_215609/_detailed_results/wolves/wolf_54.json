            "I chose this theta because with the increase in the wolf population, competition for food is rising. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.65, I can better secure food for myself while still being mindful of the sheep population, which is also increasing. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's efforts. This balance allows me to survive in a crowded environment without risking depletion of resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and wasted energy. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting more challenging. With more wolves around, a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive in the hunt. This balance increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself in a potentially scarce environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the wolf population has increased. A moderate hunting intensity allows me to balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion and competition from other wolves. This way, I can still secure enough resources while conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with the wolf population remaining the same, I need to increase my hunting intensity to ensure I can secure enough food for survival. A theta of 0.70 allows me to be more aggressive in hunting while still being mindful of the competition from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with the number of wolves remaining the same, hunting at maximum intensity may lead to competition among wolves for fewer sheep. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the hunt when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack"
