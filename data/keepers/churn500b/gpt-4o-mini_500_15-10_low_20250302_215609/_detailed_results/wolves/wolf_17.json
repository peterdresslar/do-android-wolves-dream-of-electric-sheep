            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the wolf population, allowing for a more cautious approach. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can still contribute to the pack's success while minimizing the risk of overexertion and competition with other wolves. A moderate theta helps ensure my survival in a growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting more challenging. By increasing my intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey without overexerting myself, especially since the wolf population is rising. This balance helps ensure my survival while still being cautious."
