            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy while still allowing for opportunistic hunting. This balance increases my chances of survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, which means food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of securing enough food while still conserving energy. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low, and the recent decrease in both sheep and wolves suggests that hunting at maximum intensity could lead to overexploitation of the sheep population. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and ensure my survival while still contributing to the pack"
