            "I chose this theta because with 15 sheep and 10 wolves, the competition for food is high. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of successfully hunting while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, which means there is more food available. However, with the number of wolves remaining the same, I need to balance my hunting intensity to avoid competition with others while still ensuring I can secure enough food for myself. A moderate intensity allows me to be efficient without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. With fewer wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid competition while still being effective in securing food.",

This strategy helps ensure my survival in a changing environment.",
