However, with the recent decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food while conserving energy for future hunts. A theta of 0.75 allows me to be aggressive enough to secure prey but not so intense that I risk overexertion or attracting too much competition from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself.

However, with the number of wolves remaining the same, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still secure enough food while avoiding overexertion. A theta of 0.75 allows me to be competitive without risking depletion of resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. By lowering my intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, especially since the number of wolves has remained stable.
