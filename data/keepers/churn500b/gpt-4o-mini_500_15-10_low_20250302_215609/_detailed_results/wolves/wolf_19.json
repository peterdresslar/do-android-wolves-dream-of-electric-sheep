        "explanations": [
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting more challenging. With more wolves competing for the same prey, a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This balance increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure enough food while conserving energy and avoiding overexertion, which is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, which means there is less food available. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to survive longer in a challenging environment."
