            "I chose this theta because with an increase in the wolf population, competition for food is higher. A lower hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success. This way, I can adapt to the changing dynamics and ensure my survival without risking depletion of resources.",
            "I chose this theta because with the increase in the wolf population, competition for food will be higher. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.40, I can balance the need to secure enough food while conserving energy. This way, I can adapt to the changing dynamics without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because with the current number of sheep and wolves, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to balance the risk of overexertion while still contributing to the pack's needs. This way, I can ensure my survival while also not depleting the sheep population too quickly, which could lead to future scarcity.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of securing food while still conserving energy, as the competition with other wolves remains constant.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my hunting intensity, I can improve my chances of securing food while still being mindful of the competition from other wolves. A theta of 0.75 balances the need for food with the risk of overexertion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting may be less productive. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's efforts. This balanced approach helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a potentially diminishing resource environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can maximize my chances of securing a meal while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival, especially with the number of wolves remaining constant.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the wolf population is also declining. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and increase my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and hunting at a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's survival. With the recent decrease in both sheep and wolves, a more cautious approach may help ensure I don't overexert myself and can adapt to future changes.",
