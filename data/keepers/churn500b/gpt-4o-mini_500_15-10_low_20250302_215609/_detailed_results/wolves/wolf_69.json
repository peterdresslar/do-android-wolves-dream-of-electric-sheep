            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting more challenging. With more wolves around, a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive in securing food. This balance increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, I need to increase my hunting intensity to compete effectively for food while still being mindful of energy conservation. A theta of 0.60 strikes a balance between hunting efficiently and not exhausting myself too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting more competitive. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexerting myself in a situation where prey is scarce. This strategy allows me to survive longer while still contributing to the pack's overall success.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and with more wolves competing for the same prey, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and reduce the risk of failure in hunting. This way, I can still contribute to the pack while ensuring my own survival."
