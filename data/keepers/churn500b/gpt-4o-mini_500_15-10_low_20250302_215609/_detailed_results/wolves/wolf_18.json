            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for the available sheep. By reducing my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the hunt. This balance helps ensure my survival in a growing pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with the wolf population also declining, hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's survival, balancing the need for food with the risk of overexertion.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low, and the recent decrease in both sheep and wolves suggests that hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment."
