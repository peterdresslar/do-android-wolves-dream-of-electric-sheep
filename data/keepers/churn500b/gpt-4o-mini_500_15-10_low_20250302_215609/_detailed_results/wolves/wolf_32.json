            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey without overexerting myself, which is crucial given the declining wolf population. This balance allows me to conserve energy while still being proactive in securing food."
