            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the increasing wolf population. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves for the same prey. This strategy allows me to survive longer while waiting for a more favorable hunting opportunity.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 11 wolves competing for food, a moderate increase in hunting intensity will allow me to secure enough resources without overexerting myself. This balance helps ensure my survival while still being cautious of the competition.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, which means competition for food is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity. By increasing my theta from 0.40 to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while minimizing competition with other wolves, who may also be hunting at maximum intensity. This way, I can ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the wolf population has increased. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still contributing to the pack's overall success. This strategy allows me to survive longer in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population decreasing, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food while conserving energy. A moderate intensity allows me to adapt to the changing environment and avoid overexertion, which is crucial for my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, which may be more aggressive. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current environment and increase my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a more competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while still conserving energy, as the sheep population is not high. This approach allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics and increase my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the overall wolf population suggests that competition is less intense. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can take advantage of the abundant food while still being cautious, as other wolves may also be adjusting their strategies.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 15 wolves competing for food, a slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment."
