By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid competing too aggressively with other wolves, ensuring my survival while still contributing to the pack",

With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy while still allowing for opportunistic hunting. This way, I can adapt to the changing environment and ensure my survival without overexerting myself."
