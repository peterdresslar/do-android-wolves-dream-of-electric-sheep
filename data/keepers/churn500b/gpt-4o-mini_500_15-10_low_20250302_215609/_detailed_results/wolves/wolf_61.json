            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.65, I can improve my chances of catching enough sheep while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a growing pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. With fewer sheep available and more wolves hunting, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy while still allowing for successful hunts. This balance increases my chances of survival in a more competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough prey without exhausting myself. A moderate increase in intensity will help me compete effectively while conserving energy.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, and the number of wolves is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still contributing to the hunt when necessary. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment."
