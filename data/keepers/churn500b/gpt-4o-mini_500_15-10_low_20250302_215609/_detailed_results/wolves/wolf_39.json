            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's efforts. This strategy allows me to avoid overexertion and increases my chances of survival in a competitive environment with more wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can better compete for food without overexerting myself, which could lead to exhaustion or injury. A theta of 0.40 allows me to balance the need for food with the risk of attracting attention from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. With the wolf population decreasing, a moderate intensity allows me to be more strategic and conserve energy while still being effective in securing food.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests competition is less intense, allowing me to hunt with a bit more intensity without risking overexertion or attracting too much attention from other wolves. A theta of 0.75 balances the need for food with the need for caution."
