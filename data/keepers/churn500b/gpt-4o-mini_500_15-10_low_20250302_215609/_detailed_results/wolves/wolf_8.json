However, I want to avoid overexerting myself and risking injury or exhaustion, especially since the number of wolves has remained stable. A moderate intensity allows me to balance the need for food with the need for caution.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival in a growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and with more wolves around, competition for food will increase. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success. This strategy allows me to survive longer in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. By adjusting my intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still being competitive with other wolves, ensuring my survival in this environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of securing food while still conserving energy for future hunts, especially considering the recent increase in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, which means there is enough food available. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the current situation without overexerting myself, ensuring I remain healthy and capable of competing with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because with an increase in the wolf population, competition for food will be higher. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a potentially scarce environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased significantly, which means competition for food is higher. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, while still contributing to the pack's overall success. This strategy allows me to survive in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can balance the need to hunt effectively while conserving energy for future hunts. This way, I can adapt to the changing dynamics and ensure my survival without overexerting myself."
