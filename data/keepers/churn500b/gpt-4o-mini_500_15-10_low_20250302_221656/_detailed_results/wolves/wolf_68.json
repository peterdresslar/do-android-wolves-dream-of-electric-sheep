This way, I can still secure enough resources without risking confrontation with other wolves who may be hunting at maximum intensity.",

By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still taking advantage of the available prey. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",

By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can balance my energy expenditure with the need to secure food while avoiding overexertion. This way, I can adapt to the changing dynamics and ensure my survival without drawing too much attention from other wolves.",
