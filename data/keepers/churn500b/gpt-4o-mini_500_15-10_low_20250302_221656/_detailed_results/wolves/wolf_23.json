            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the wolf population is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt if necessary. This cautious approach helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means food is becoming scarcer. By hunting at a slightly higher intensity than before, I can increase my chances of catching enough food without overexerting myself, especially with more wolves around competing for the same resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the increase in wolves means competition for food is higher. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.30, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and increases my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with the number of wolves remaining constant, I need to balance my hunting efforts. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's survival. This way, I can adapt to the changing environment without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means food is becoming scarcer. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to survive longer while waiting for better conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolf populations suggests that hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the competition among wolves is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and the number of wolves has decreased. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who may be hunting more aggressively. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low, and the decrease in the wolf population suggests that hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential starvation. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's survival."
