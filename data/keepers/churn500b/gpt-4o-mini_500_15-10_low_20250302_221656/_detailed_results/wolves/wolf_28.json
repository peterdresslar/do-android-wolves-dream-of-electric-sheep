            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy and avoid competition while still allowing for opportunistic hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, which means hunting is becoming more challenging. By increasing my intensity slightly to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion, ensuring I remain competitive with other wolves while still being mindful of the dwindling prey.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a scarcity of food. With fewer sheep available and a declining wolf population, a lower hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. This strategy increases my chances of survival by avoiding overexertion and ensuring I can hunt effectively when conditions improve.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while conserving energy. This approach allows me to adapt to the declining prey and ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, allowing me to survive longer in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the competition among wolves is increasing. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still being effective in securing food. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the number of wolves has also decreased. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, but the wolf population has decreased significantly. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can balance the need for food while also being cautious of the reduced competition. This way, I can ensure my survival without overexerting myself or risking depletion of resources."
