            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that food is becoming scarcer. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high, but the increase in wolves means competition for food is rising. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can maximize my chances of catching prey while still conserving some energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and with 23 wolves competing for food, a slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting may be more challenging. By increasing my intensity slightly from my previous 0.60 to 0.75, I can improve my chances of successfully hunting while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",

This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because with a stable number of wolves and a slight increase in sheep, I can afford to hunt with moderate intensity. This allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, as the sheep population is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves. A lower intensity also reduces competition with other wolves who are hunting at maximum intensity.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, which means there is enough food to go around. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still contributing to the hunt. This balance helps ensure my survival in a growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased significantly, which means competition for food is higher. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively when necessary. This balance helps ensure my survival in a crowded environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased significantly, which means competition for food will be higher. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.30, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a crowded environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and with 16 wolves competing for food, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive. This balance increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating less food availability. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased slightly, indicating that hunting may be less fruitful. By increasing my intensity from 0.30 to 0.40, I can still contribute to the hunt without overexerting myself, allowing for a balance between energy conservation and the need to secure food. This cautious approach helps ensure my survival while adapting to the current situation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and with the number of wolves remaining stable, I can afford to increase my hunting intensity slightly. This will help me secure enough food while still being cautious, as overhunting could lead to a decrease in sheep and ultimately threaten my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and with the wolf population remaining stable, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food without exhausting myself. A slightly higher intensity than before will help me adapt to the changing conditions while still conserving energy.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased slightly, indicating a potential scarcity of food.
