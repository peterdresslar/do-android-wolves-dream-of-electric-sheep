            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population means competition for food is rising. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a potentially scarce environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the stable wolf population. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the abundant prey while still conserving energy. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and with 17 wolves competing for food, a moderate hunting intensity will help me conserve energy while still allowing for a reasonable chance of catching prey. This balance will ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the increased number of wolves. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can maximize my chances of securing food while still being cautious about overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and increase my chances of survival while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This balanced approach allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because with the number of sheep increasing and the wolf population remaining stable, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can secure enough food without overexerting myself. A moderate intensity allows me to be efficient while also conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, which means there is enough food available. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively. This balance helps ensure my survival without competing too aggressively with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. By increasing my intensity slightly, I can take advantage of this situation while still conserving energy in case the competition with other wolves increases.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 42.12, and with 17 wolves, competition is present but not overwhelming. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt, ensuring I have enough resources for survival without overexerting myself in a potentially competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased slightly, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.65, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased slightly, which means there may be less food available. By increasing my hunting intensity from 0.65 to 0.75, I can improve my chances of successfully catching prey while still being mindful of the competition from other wolves. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the wolf population has increased. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and with 36.60 sheep available, I can afford to increase my hunting intensity slightly. This will allow me to secure more food while still being mindful of the competition from other wolves. A theta of 0.75 balances the need for food with the risk of overexertion.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.5, I can conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low, and the competition among wolves is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid drawing attention to myself, increasing my chances of survival in a declining population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the dwindling wolf population. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still conserving energy and avoiding overexertion, which is crucial for my survival in this competitive environment.",

By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can take advantage of the available prey while still conserving energy for future hunts.

This strategy allows me to avoid competition with other wolves who may be hunting at maximum intensity, ensuring my survival in the long run.",

By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still taking advantage of the available prey. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
