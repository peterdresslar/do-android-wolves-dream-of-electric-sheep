            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.45, I can balance the need to hunt effectively while conserving energy and avoiding overexertion. This way, I can ensure my survival without risking depletion of resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid competition while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and less chance of securing a meal. By increasing my intensity slightly, I can balance the need for food while avoiding overexertion and competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, I need to increase my hunting intensity to compete effectively for the limited resources. However, I don't want to overexert myself and risk injury, so a moderate increase to 0.60 allows me to balance my energy and increase my chances of a successful hunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the wolf population, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves for the same prey. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid unnecessary confrontations, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, and the number of wolves is also declining. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who may be hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in the wolf population indicates increased competition for food. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can balance the need to secure food while conserving energy and avoiding overexertion, especially since the sheep population is relatively stable."
