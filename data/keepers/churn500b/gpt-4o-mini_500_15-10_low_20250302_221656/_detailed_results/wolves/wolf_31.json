            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With an increase in the wolf population, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential overhunting. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt, ensuring my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. However, the increase in the wolf population suggests that competition for food is rising. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly to 0.55, I can take advantage of the current situation without overexerting myself, allowing for a balance between ensuring my survival and conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with the number of wolves remaining the same, hunting at full intensity may not be sustainable. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's needs, ensuring my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is increasing. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of securing food while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the decreased number of wolves. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still taking advantage of the available prey. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition is fierce. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can take advantage of the available prey while still being cautious about the risks posed by other wolves."
