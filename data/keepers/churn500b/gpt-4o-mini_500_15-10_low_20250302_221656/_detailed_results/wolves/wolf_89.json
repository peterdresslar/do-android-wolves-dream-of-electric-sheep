            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, which means there is enough food available. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to catch enough prey to survive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 15 wolves, competition for food is moderate. Increasing my hunting intensity slightly to 0.65 allows me to take advantage of the available prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. By lowering my intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This approach allows me to adapt to the current situation and avoid competition with other wolves who may be hunting at maximum intensity.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting. By increasing my intensity to 0.75, I can take advantage of the higher availability of prey while still conserving some energy for future hunts, ensuring my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the number of sheep increasing and the wolf population stable, I can afford to hunt with less intensity. This allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in securing food. A lower intensity also reduces the risk of competition with other wolves, as they are likely hunting at maximum intensity.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 14 wolves competing for food, a moderate increase in hunting intensity will help me secure enough resources without overexerting myself. This balance allows me to stay competitive while conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased slightly, indicating a potential scarcity of food. With an increase in the wolf population, hunting at a slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and I want to increase my chances of a successful hunt without overexerting myself. By raising my intensity from 0.60 to 0.75, I can be more competitive against other wolves while still conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a lower availability of food. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, allowing me to adapt to the changing environment and increase my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population decreasing, I need to increase my hunting intensity to secure enough food for survival. However, I want to be cautious and not overexert myself, as the wolf population remains stable. A theta of 0.75 strikes a balance between ensuring I get enough food while conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means food is becoming scarcer. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are likely to hunt at maximum intensity. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
