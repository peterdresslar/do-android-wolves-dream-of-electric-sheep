            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the wolf population has increased. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves for the dwindling sheep. This strategy allows me to survive longer while waiting for a more favorable situation.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. With the increase in the wolf population, hunting at a higher intensity will improve my chances of securing enough food while still being mindful of the competition. A theta of 0.70 balances the need for food with the risk of overexertion.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the increase in wolves means competition for food is rising. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making them scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential failure. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and wait for a better opportunity when the sheep population stabilizes.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is increasing. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still being effective in securing food. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the wolf population is still relatively high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves for limited prey. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and the number of wolves is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves for scarce resources. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment."
