            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population decreasing, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that food is becoming scarcer. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, allowing me to survive longer in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is increasing. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while conserving energy for future hunts. This approach allows me to adapt to the changing environment and improve my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the number of wolves, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves for the same prey. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct conflict, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased slightly, indicating a stable food source. However, with the number of wolves remaining the same, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough prey without overexerting myself. A moderate increase in theta allows me to be more competitive without risking exhaustion.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in the wolf population suggests increased competition for food. By increasing my hunting intensity, I can better secure a meal while still being cautious not to overexert myself, given the current sheep population. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased slightly, but the number of wolves has decreased. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This balance helps ensure my survival in a changing environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing more opportunities for hunting. However, with the number of wolves remaining the same, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough prey without exhausting myself or competing too aggressively with other wolves. A slight increase in intensity allows me to take advantage of the higher sheep count while still being cautious.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, but the wolf population has decreased. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still taking advantage of the available prey. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, with the number of wolves decreasing, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can secure enough food without overexerting myself. A theta of 0.60 allows me to be more efficient while still being mindful of the competition.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 12 wolves, competition for food is present but not overwhelming.
