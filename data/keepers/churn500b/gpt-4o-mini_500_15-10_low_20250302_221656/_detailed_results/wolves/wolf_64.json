            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 11 wolves competing for food, a slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This balance increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because with an increasing number of wolves, competition for food is rising. By reducing my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival in a crowded environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively. This balance helps ensure my survival in a more competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased significantly, which means competition for food is higher. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.30, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success. This strategy allows me to survive longer in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the current number of sheep and wolves, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to balance the risk of overexertion while still being effective in securing food. With 44.61 sheep and 16 wolves, I need to be cautious, as other wolves may also be hunting at maximum intensity. A theta of 0.50 gives me a chance to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased slightly, and with the number of wolves remaining the same, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to overexploitation of the sheep. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can ensure that I have enough resources while also allowing the sheep population to stabilize, which is crucial for long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively when necessary. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, indicating more food availability. However, with the number of wolves remaining constant, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can secure enough food without overexerting myself. A moderate increase in theta allows me to be more competitive while still conserving energy.",
            "I chose this theta because with the number of sheep increasing slightly and the wolf population remaining stable, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to balance the need for food while minimizing competition with other wolves. This way, I can still secure enough resources without overexerting myself or risking injury.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the wolf population is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance my energy expenditure while still contributing to the pack's efforts. This way, I can conserve energy for future hunts and ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting may be less fruitful if I go all out. By increasing my intensity slightly from my previous theta, I can take advantage of the current situation while still conserving energy for future hunts, ensuring my survival in a fluctuating environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This balance allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself, ensuring my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means hunting might become more competitive. By increasing my intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of securing food while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival as the competition among wolves remains constant.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making hunting more competitive. By increasing my intensity slightly from 0.65 to 0.75, I can improve my chances of successfully hunting while still conserving energy in case the situation worsens. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the competition among wolves is increasing. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This balance may help ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the competition among wolves is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, and the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition for food is less intense. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can balance the need to secure food while conserving energy and avoiding overexertion, which is crucial for my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has decreased, making competition for food less intense. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy while still taking advantage of the available sheep. This strategy allows me to survive longer without overexerting myself, especially since the sheep population has slightly increased.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, with the number of wolves remaining the same, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food without exhausting myself or risking injury. A moderate intensity allows for a sustainable approach to hunting while still being competitive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting. However, with the number of wolves remaining the same, I want to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I have enough energy for future hunts while still being competitive.

            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, but the wolf population has decreased. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting.
