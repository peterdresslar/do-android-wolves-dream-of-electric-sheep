With an increase in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food without exhausting myself. A theta of 0.60 allows me to be more efficient while still contributing to the pack's success.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, competition for food is higher, so a lower intensity will help conserve energy while still allowing for opportunistic hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that food is becoming scarcer. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to survive longer in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while being cautious not to overexert myself, given the dwindling sheep population. This approach allows me to adapt to the situation and ensure my survival without risking too much energy.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, who are likely to hunt at maximum intensity. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the wolf population is also declining. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while not overexerting myself, as the competition among wolves is still present. This way, I can ensure my survival without risking too much energy in a potentially scarce environment."
