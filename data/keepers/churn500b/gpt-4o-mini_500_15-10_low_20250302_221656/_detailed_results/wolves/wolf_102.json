This balance increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself in a potentially scarce environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and I want to increase my chances of a successful hunt without overexerting myself. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who may be hunting at maximum intensity.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and I need to conserve energy while hunting. With the recent decrease in both sheep and wolves, a moderate intensity allows me to remain competitive without overexerting myself. This way, I can adapt to the changing environment and ensure my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, indicating a good opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition is less intense, allowing me to hunt with a bit more intensity without risking overexertion. A theta of 0.70 balances the need for food with the caution required in a declining wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the competition among wolves is increasing. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This balanced approach increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the number of wolves. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still allowing for a sustainable approach to hunting. This strategy increases my chances of survival in the long run.",
