            "I chose this theta because with an increase in the number of wolves, competition for food is intensifying. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity, I can improve my chances of securing enough food while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, indicating a good food supply, but the number of wolves remains the same. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still having a chance to catch prey. This balance helps ensure my survival in a stable environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, indicating more food availability. However, with the number of wolves remaining the same, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I have enough energy for future hunts while still being competitive. A slightly higher intensity than before allows me to take advantage of the increased sheep without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because with a stable number of wolves and an increase in sheep, I want to balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion. A slightly higher intensity than before allows me to take advantage of the increased sheep population while still being cautious, as other wolves may also be hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and avoid overhunting the sheep, ensuring that I have enough resources to survive in the long run while still contributing to the pack's success."
