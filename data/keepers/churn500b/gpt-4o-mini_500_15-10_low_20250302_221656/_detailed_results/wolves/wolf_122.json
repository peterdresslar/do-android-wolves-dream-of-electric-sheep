By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can better secure my share of the sheep while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a more competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased slightly, and the wolf population has increased. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy. This balance is crucial for my survival, especially with the competition from other wolves.",

            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, which means food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting may be less fruitful. By lowering my intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, allowing me to adapt to the current situation and avoid overexertion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, indicating that hunting might be less fruitful. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt if the opportunity arises.",
