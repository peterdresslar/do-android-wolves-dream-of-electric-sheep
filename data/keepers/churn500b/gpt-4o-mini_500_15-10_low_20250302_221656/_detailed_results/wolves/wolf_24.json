            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy while still allowing for successful hunts. This balance increases my chances of survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts. This strategy increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With the increase in the wolf population, competition for food will be higher. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, which means food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a scarcity of food. With fewer sheep available, hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable and could lead to exhaustion or failure. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the population of sheep is decreasing, and with fewer sheep available, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food without exhausting myself or competing too aggressively with other wolves. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the wolf population is also declining. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are likely hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment."
