            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting more challenging. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and avoid competition while still allowing for some hunting. This balance increases my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. However, the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for hunting. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of securing food while still being cautious about overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with the number of wolves remaining constant, hunting at a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. This strategy may help ensure my survival by avoiding overexertion in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the population of wolves is also declining. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's survival. This balance allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself, especially as the competition among wolves increases."
