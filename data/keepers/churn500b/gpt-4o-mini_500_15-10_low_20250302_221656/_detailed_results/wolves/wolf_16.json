            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still taking advantage of the available prey. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a crowded hunting environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting more competitive. With more wolves around, a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in securing food. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, I need to increase my hunting intensity to compete effectively for the limited resources. A theta of 0.75 allows me to balance the need for food while conserving some energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the wolf population is still high. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively. This balanced approach increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, indicating a scarcity of food. With fewer sheep available, it may be wise to conserve energy and reduce hunting intensity to avoid competition with other wolves. A lower theta allows me to adapt to the current situation while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise."
