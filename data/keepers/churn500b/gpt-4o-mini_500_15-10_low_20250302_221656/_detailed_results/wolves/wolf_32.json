            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the increase in the wolf population means competition for food is higher. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.40, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the population of sheep is decreasing, and the number of wolves is also declining. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.30, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who may be hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to survive longer in a challenging environment while still contributing to the pack's overall success.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a tougher environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still conserving energy, as the competition among wolves is high. This approach allows me to adapt to the changing conditions without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, and the number of wolves is still relatively high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still contributing to the hunt if necessary. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and increase my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves suggests a scarcity of resources. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who may be hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, with the recent decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food while avoiding overexertion and risking my survival. A moderate intensity allows me to adapt to the changing situation.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, but the wolf population has decreased. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still allowing for a sustainable hunt.
