            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 35.09, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's needs. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself, especially since the number of wolves remains constant.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population decreasing, I need to increase my hunting intensity to ensure I can secure enough food for survival. However, I also want to be cautious and not overexert myself, as the wolf population remains stable. A theta of 0.60 strikes a balance between being competitive and conserving energy.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, which means hunting might be more competitive. By increasing my intensity to 0.75, I can improve my chances of successfully hunting while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a changing environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the competition among wolves is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid drawing attention while still contributing to the pack's efforts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, but the wolf population has decreased. This suggests that competition for food is less intense, allowing me to hunt at a lower intensity while still being effective. By conserving energy, I can ensure my survival in case of future challenges.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, with the recent decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still survive while not overexerting myself. A moderate intensity allows me to hunt effectively without risking too much energy or attracting unwanted attention from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing more food opportunities. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests competition is high, so I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough prey while not exhausting myself or risking injury in a competitive hunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with fewer wolves around, I can afford to hunt with moderate intensity. This allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's survival. A lower intensity also reduces the risk of overexertion, which is crucial given the recent decline in our numbers.",
