            "I chose this theta because while the number of sheep is still relatively high, the increase in wolves means competition for food is rising. A slightly higher intensity than before allows me to take advantage of the situation without overexerting myself, ensuring I can still hunt effectively while conserving energy.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, which means competition for food is increasing. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid drawing attention to myself while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because with a stable number of wolves and an increase in sheep, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment."
