            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's efforts, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the wolf population is still high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still contributing to the hunt when necessary. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the number of wolves, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves for the same prey. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct confrontation, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. By increasing my intensity to 0.50, I can contribute to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the dwindling wolf population. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still allowing for a chance to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in the wolf population suggests competition is becoming tougher. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while conserving energy for future hunts, as the sheep population is still relatively high.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can take advantage of the higher number of sheep while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself, especially since the number of wolves remains constant.",
            "I chose this theta because with 30 sheep and 9 wolves, the competition for food is high. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success. This balanced approach helps ensure my survival without risking depletion of resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. By increasing my intensity to 0.70, I can take advantage of the higher prey availability while still conserving energy compared to maximum intensity. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival in a stable environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. By increasing my intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the higher number of sheep while still conserving energy compared to maximum intensity. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with the recent increase in wolves, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food without exhausting myself or competing too fiercely with others. A slightly higher intensity than before allows me to take advantage of the current sheep numbers while still being mindful of the increased competition.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. By reducing my intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, especially since the number of wolves has remained constant. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and with the recent increase in wolves, hunting at a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.40, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's efforts. This strategy allows me to be more adaptable and ensures my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. By increasing my intensity to 0.60, I can take advantage of the higher number of sheep while still being cautious, as the wolf population remains the same. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population means competition for food is rising. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can better secure my share of the sheep while still being mindful of the sustainability of the prey population. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexploiting the resource.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting more competitive. By reducing my intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This allows me to adapt to the changing environment and increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, and the number of wolves has increased. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves for the limited sheep. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting may be more challenging. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts, especially since the number of wolves remains constant.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and risk injury. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid confrontations while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, which may be more aggressive.
