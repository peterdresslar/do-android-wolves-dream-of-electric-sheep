However, the decrease in the wolf population indicates increased competition for resources. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.30, I can conserve energy and avoid drawing too much attention while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. With the recent decrease in the wolf population, a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's survival. This balance helps ensure I can hunt effectively without risking my own safety.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. By increasing my intensity slightly to 0.65, I can take advantage of the higher prey availability while still conserving energy and avoiding overexertion. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves."
