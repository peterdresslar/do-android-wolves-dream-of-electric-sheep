            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food without exhausting myself or risking competition with other wolves. A moderate increase from my previous theta allows me to adapt to the rising wolf population while still being cautious.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. By adjusting my intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still being competitive with other wolves, who are likely hunting at maximum intensity. This balance helps ensure my survival in the current situation.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, which means there is enough food available. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.65, I can take advantage of the situation without overexerting myself, allowing for a balance between hunting success and energy conservation. This way, I can ensure my survival while still being cautious about the increasing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is increasing. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means food is becoming scarcer. With an increase in the wolf population, competition for food will be higher. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt when opportunities arise. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By adjusting my hunting intensity to a moderate level, I can conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a potentially crowded hunting scenario.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making them scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and wait for better opportunities while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can strike a balance between conserving energy and increasing my chances of securing food, which is crucial for survival. This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity while still being cautious of the competition.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By lowering my intensity to 0.30, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who may be hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise."
