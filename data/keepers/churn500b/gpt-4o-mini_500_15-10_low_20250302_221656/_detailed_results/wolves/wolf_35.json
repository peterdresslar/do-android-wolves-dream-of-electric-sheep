            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy while still allowing for a chance to catch prey without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the competition among wolves is high with their numbers also declining. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low, and the wolf population has decreased significantly. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's survival. This balance may help ensure I can hunt effectively without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low, and the wolf population has decreased significantly. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, with the recent decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still secure enough food while also conserving energy and avoiding overexertion. A moderate intensity of 0.50 allows me to adapt to the current situation effectively.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, but the wolf population has decreased. This suggests that hunting at maximum intensity may lead to competition with other wolves and could jeopardize my survival. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population increasing and the number of wolves remaining stable, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to balance the need for food while reducing the risk of overexertion and competition with other wolves. This way, I can ensure my survival without depleting resources too quickly."
