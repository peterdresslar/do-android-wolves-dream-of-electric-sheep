            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. With an increase in the wolf population, competition for resources will be higher. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of securing food while still being cautious not to overexert myself, as I need to conserve energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting more competitive. With more wolves around, I need to increase my hunting intensity to secure enough food for survival. A theta of 0.75 balances the need for food with the risk of overexertion.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in sheep suggests that hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. With fewer sheep available, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's survival. This strategy may also help avoid competition with other wolves who are hunting at full intensity.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the wolf population is also declining. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can better secure food while still being cautious not to overexert myself, given the declining prey availability. This balance helps ensure my survival without risking exhaustion.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the wolf population is also declining. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who may be hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low, and the competition among wolves is high due to their recent decrease. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can better secure food while still being cautious about overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition is less intense. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.45, I can conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, ensuring my survival without overexerting myself."
