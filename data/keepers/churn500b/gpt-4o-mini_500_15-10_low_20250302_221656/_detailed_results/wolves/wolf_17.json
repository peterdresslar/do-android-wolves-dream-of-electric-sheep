            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and wasted energy. A slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, ensuring my survival in this competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy and avoid competition while still allowing for some hunting success.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the overall population of wolves is also declining. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who may be hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises."
