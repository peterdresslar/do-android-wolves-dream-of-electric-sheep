            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 37\n- Sheep population: 37.88\n- Wolf population: 29.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.350\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 1.31 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 34.4% of maximum capacity\n\nEcosystem observations:\n- The wolf population is moderately high.\n- The ratio of sheep to wolves is becoming less favorable, which may require adaptation.\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3. Adjust your hunting intensity gradually in response to population changes\n4. Find a balance that creates sustainable cycles rather than crashes\n5. Consider both immediate needs and long-term consequences of your decisions\nPlease provide a short explanation of your reasoning for choosing theta.\nPlease also provide a short vocalization expressing your wolf's attitude about the current situation.\nPlease respond with a JSON object in this format, where [your new theta] is a float between 0 and 1 with your new theta (up to 2 decimal places):\n\n            {\n                \"theta\": [your new theta],\n                \"explanation\": \"I chose this theta because...\",\n                \"vocalization\": \"Growwllllllll...\"\n            }\n            "

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help support wolf reproduction while still maintaining a healthy sheep population. Given the low wolf population, a slight increase in hunting can promote growth without risking depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will support wolf reproduction while still ensuring that the sheep population can recover. A gradual adjustment helps maintain balance and avoids depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while there is room for increased hunting, I want to ensure that we do not over-deplete the sheep. A moderate increase in hunting intensity allows for gradual growth in the wolf population while still maintaining a healthy balance with the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful at 67.49, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while ensuring that the sheep population remains sustainable. A gradual approach helps maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful at 72.21, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help sustain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover, as they are at 65.6% of their maximum capacity. A moderate increase to 0.60 strikes a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring a healthy food source.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful at 73.20, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still maintaining a sustainable balance with the sheep population. Given that the sheep are at 66.5% of their maximum capacity, a moderate increase to 0.65 allows for effective hunting without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful at 73.59, which allows for a moderate hunting intensity. This value maintains a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring both populations can thrive without depleting resources too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful at 71.44, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain our wolf population while still keeping an eye on the sheep numbers to avoid depletion. A moderate increase to 0.60 reflects a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while ensuring we can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. The wolf population is moderately high, so a gradual adjustment towards hunting will help sustain both populations without risking depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 58.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and allow the sheep population to recover while still ensuring the wolves can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, and while it is beneficial to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A small adjustment allows for a balanced approach that can help sustain both populations without risking depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of gradual changes to ensure long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 48.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population being moderately high and the sheep-to-wolf ratio becoming less favorable, a slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted to ensure the health of the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. This adjustment is gradual, aligning with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
