This value reflects a balanced approach, considering the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need for gradual adjustments.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a sustainable balance. This adjustment reflects the current state of the ecosystem, where the sheep are at 66.9% of their maximum capacity, and it is important to ensure that both populations can thrive without depleting resources too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful at 73.47, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This value balances the need to sustain our wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. It reflects a cautious approach to hunting, considering the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need for long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, and while the wolf population is moderately high, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain a sustainable balance, allowing both populations to thrive without depleting resources too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still recovering and is at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the balance between wolves and sheep. This adjustment reflects the need to adapt to the changing sheep-to-wolf ratio without overexploiting the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still recovering, and while it is above 50% of maximum capacity, the wolf population is moderately high. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to stabilize while still enabling the wolf population to thrive. This approach maintains a balance that supports both species in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while still enabling us to compete effectively with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep population to recover while ensuring the long-term survival of both species. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain a balance as the sheep population is recovering, while also considering the moderately high wolf population. A gradual increase will support sustainable coexistence without risking depletion of the sheep.",

A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while still enabling us to compete effectively with other wolves.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support the wolf population without over-depleting the sheep, ensuring sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while still maintaining enough pressure to support wolf reproduction. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of ensuring a sustainable balance."
