            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 42.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. However, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, suggesting that I should focus more on competing with other wolves to ensure our population remains stable while allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain balance in the ecosystem.",

A slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain our population while allowing the sheep to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of adapting to changing conditions without risking overexploitation.",

The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, suggesting that I should focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the wolf population dynamics.
