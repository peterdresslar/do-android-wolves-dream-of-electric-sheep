With the wolf population moderately high, a slight reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain sustainability while still allowing for some reproduction. This adjustment supports the long-term survival of both species.",

A slight decrease in hunting intensity allows for better competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover. This adjustment aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence.",

A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while still enabling wolves to compete effectively. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
