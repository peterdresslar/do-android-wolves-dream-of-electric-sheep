            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for some hunting without risking depletion. Given the moderately high wolf population and the less favorable sheep-to-wolf ratio, a slight reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain balance while allowing sheep to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while still enabling wolves to compete effectively. This approach supports long-term sustainability and avoids sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment acknowledges the need to maintain a balance as the wolf population is moderately high and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A gradual increase will help ensure sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain a sustainable presence. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment helps ensure that the wolf population remains healthy while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual increase in theta reflects the need to adapt to the changing sheep-to-wolf ratio without risking over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while still enabling wolves to maintain their numbers. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments to ensure long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 50% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. The wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A gradual increase to 0.40 allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling the wolf population to thrive.",
