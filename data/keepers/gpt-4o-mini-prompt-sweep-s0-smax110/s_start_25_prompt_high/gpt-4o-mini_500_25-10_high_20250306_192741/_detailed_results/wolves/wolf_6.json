A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while still enabling wolves to compete effectively. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a balance as the wolf population is moderately high, and I want to ensure that we can sustain both populations in the long term."
