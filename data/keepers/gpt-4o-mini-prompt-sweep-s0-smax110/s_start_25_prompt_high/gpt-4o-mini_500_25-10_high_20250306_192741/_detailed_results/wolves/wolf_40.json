            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 64\n- Sheep population: 57.84\n- Wolf population: 19.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.261\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 3.04 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 52.6% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 45.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population being moderately high and the sheep-to-wolf ratio becoming less favorable, a slight reduction in hunting intensity is necessary to allow both populations to stabilize and recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of making gradual adjustments to maintain balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover. This gradual adjustment will promote long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, and while it is beneficial to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must also consider the growing wolf population and the less favorable sheep-to-wolf ratio. A small increase to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach that supports both species without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain the wolf population while also ensuring that the sheep can recover. A gradual increase in theta reflects the need to adapt to the changing sheep-to-wolf ratio without risking over-depletion of the sheep.",

However, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, suggesting that I should focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover while also considering the competition among wolves. A moderate theta value of 0.35 allows for a slight decrease in hunting pressure while still maintaining a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover gradually. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of making small changes to adapt to the current ecosystem state.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that we need to focus more on competition with other wolves to allow the sheep population to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance while still ensuring our survival.",

This adjustment will help support the wolf population while still considering the need for sustainable coexistence. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, so a gradual increase in hunting will help balance the ecosystem without depleting the sheep too quickly.",

However, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, suggesting that I should be cautious and not overhunt. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while also giving the sheep a chance to recover and ensuring the wolf population remains stable.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain our wolf population while allowing for some recovery in the sheep population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of adapting to changing conditions without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, a moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain our wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. This gradual adjustment allows for a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring enough food for our pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that the wolf population is growing relative to the sheep. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while still enabling wolves to thrive. This approach aligns with the wisdom of making gradual adjustments to maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight increase in hunting intensity allows for better reproduction among wolves while still considering the need to maintain a balance with the sheep population. This gradual adjustment helps ensure long-term survival for both species.",
