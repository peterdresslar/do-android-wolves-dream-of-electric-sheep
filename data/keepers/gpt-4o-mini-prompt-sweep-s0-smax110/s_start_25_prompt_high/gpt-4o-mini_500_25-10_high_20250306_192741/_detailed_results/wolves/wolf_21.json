            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful at 71.44, which allows for a moderate hunting intensity. This value supports sustainable coexistence while still enabling the wolf population to thrive. It also aligns with the wisdom of gradually increasing hunting intensity as the sheep population is above 64.9% of maximum capacity.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, but the wolf population is moderately high. A slight reduction in hunting intensity allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves. This adjustment helps maintain a balance as the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A moderate approach allows for some hunting to sustain our population while giving sheep a chance to recover. This balance is crucial for long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy, and while the wolf population is moderately high, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow sheep to recover while still enabling wolves to thrive. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, and the wolf population is relatively high.

A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while still maintaining enough pressure to support wolf reproduction. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments to ensure long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.7% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking immediate depletion. Given the moderately high wolf population and the less favorable sheep-to-wolf ratio, a gradual increase to 0.40 will help maintain balance while still allowing for some recovery of the sheep population.",
