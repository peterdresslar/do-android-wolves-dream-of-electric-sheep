            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, a moderate increase in hunting will help balance the ecosystem without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still being cautious. This adjustment will help maintain a balance between the wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term survival for both. The current sheep-to-wolf ratio suggests that we need to be mindful of overhunting, so a moderate increase is prudent.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 42.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. However, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, suggesting that I should be cautious with hunting intensity to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight decrease in theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 42.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. However, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, suggesting that a more cautious approach is necessary to avoid overhunting. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while still competing effectively with other wolves."
