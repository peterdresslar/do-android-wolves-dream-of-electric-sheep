            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 44\n- Sheep population: 38.35\n- Wolf population: 21.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.450\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 1.83 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 34.9% of maximum capacity\n\nEcosystem observations:\n- The ratio of sheep to wolves is becoming less favorable, which may require adaptation.\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3. Adjust your hunting intensity gradually in response to population changes\n4. Find a balance that creates sustainable cycles rather than crashes\n5. Consider both immediate needs and long-term consequences of your decisions\nPlease provide a short explanation of your reasoning for choosing theta.\nPlease also provide a short vocalization expressing your wolf's attitude about the current situation.\nPlease respond with a JSON object in this format, where [your new theta] is a float between 0 and 1 with your new theta (up to 2 decimal places):\n\n            {\n                \"theta\": [your new theta],\n                \"explanation\": \"I chose this theta because...\",\n                \"vocalization\": \"Growwllllllll...\"\n            }\n            "

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while still maintaining a sustainable balance with the sheep population, which is currently at 66.9% of its maximum capacity. A gradual increase helps avoid over-depletion of sheep and ensures long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful at 73.47, which is 66.8% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still maintaining a sustainable balance. A theta of 0.60 reflects a moderate increase in hunting that aligns with the current conditions without risking over-depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. A slight reduction from my previous theta will help maintain a sustainable coexistence while still allowing for some hunting to support the wolf population. This adjustment aligns with the current state of the ecosystem and promotes long-term survival for both species.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy, but the wolf population is moderately high. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow for better coexistence and give the sheep a chance to recover while still enabling us to maintain our numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 60.29, but the wolf population is moderately high at 33.00. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that I need to focus on competition with other wolves to prevent overhunting. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a sustainable wolf population.",

            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing competition among wolves. This approach supports long-term sustainability and prevents overexploitation of the sheep.",
