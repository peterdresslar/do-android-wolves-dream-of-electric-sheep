However, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, suggesting that I should be cautious and avoid overhunting. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance while allowing for the recovery of both populations.",

However, the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A moderate theta of 0.55 allows for a balanced approach, enabling us to hunt enough to support our population while ensuring the sheep can recover and thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 50.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. The wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, so a slight reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain balance while still allowing for some reproduction among wolves.",
