This adjustment reflects the need to adapt to the changing sheep-to-wolf ratio, ensuring sustainable coexistence without depleting resources too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 42.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, suggesting that I should be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that supports both wolf reproduction and sheep recovery."
