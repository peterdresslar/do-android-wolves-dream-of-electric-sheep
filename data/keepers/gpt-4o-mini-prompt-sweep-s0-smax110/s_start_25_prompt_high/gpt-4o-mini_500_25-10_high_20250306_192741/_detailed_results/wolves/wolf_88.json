            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity, allowing the sheep population to recover while we compete with other wolves. This approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence and avoids depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 50.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain our population while allowing the sheep to recover, but I must be cautious to avoid overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need for sustainable coexistence, a gradual increase is prudent.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while still maintaining enough hunting to support the wolf population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking over-depletion. This adjustment aims to balance the needs of the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover and maintain a sustainable ecosystem.",
