            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 41.5% of its maximum capacity, which allows for some hunting without risking depletion. However, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that I need to be cautious and focus on competition with other wolves to maintain a healthy balance. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help ensure the long-term survival of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 42.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, suggesting that I should be cautious and not overhunt. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that the wolf population is growing relative to the sheep. A moderate decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while still enabling the wolves to sustain themselves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain our population while still allowing the sheep to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of adapting to changing conditions without risking overexploitation."
