A moderate increase to 0.45 allows for some hunting while still considering the long-term balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to thrive. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a balance and responding to the current ecosystem conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that we need to focus more on competition among wolves rather than intense hunting. By lowering the hunting intensity slightly, I can allow the sheep population to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, so I must be cautious and avoid overhunting. A gradual increase to 0.40 allows for better balance while still considering the long-term survival of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively low compared to the maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain its health. This moderate approach aligns with the wisdom of adapting gradually to changing conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain our population while allowing the sheep to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of adapting to changing conditions without risking a crash."
