However, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, suggesting that I should be cautious about hunting intensity to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population.",

This adjustment allows for a gradual response to the changing dynamics while keeping both populations in check.",

This approach balances the need for wolf reproduction with the health of the sheep population.",

The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, so a moderate approach will help maintain balance without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable.

This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance.

This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between both populations.",
