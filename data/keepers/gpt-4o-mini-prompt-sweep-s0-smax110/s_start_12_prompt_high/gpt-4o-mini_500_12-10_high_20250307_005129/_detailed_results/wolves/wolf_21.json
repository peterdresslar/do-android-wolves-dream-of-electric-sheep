By maintaining a moderate theta, I can ensure that we continue to thrive without depleting the sheep too quickly. This adjustment reflects the need to adapt to the current conditions while also considering the long-term sustainability of both populations.",

This value balances the need to sustain our wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. It reflects a cautious approach to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly, while still allowing for some growth in our numbers.",
