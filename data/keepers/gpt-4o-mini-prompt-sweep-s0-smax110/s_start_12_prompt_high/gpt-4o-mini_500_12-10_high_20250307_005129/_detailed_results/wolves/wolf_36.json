            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 33\n- Sheep population: 66.71\n- Wolf population: 30.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.037\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 2.22 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 60.6% of maximum capacity\n\nEcosystem observations:\n- The wolf population is moderately high.\n- Sheep are reasonably plentiful.\n- The ratio of sheep to wolves is becoming less favorable, which may require adaptation.\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",

While the wolf population is moderately high, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight increase in hunting intensity will allow for some reproduction while still giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the wolf population is moderately high. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain our numbers while allowing the sheep to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the need to adapt to the changing sheep-to-wolf ratio without risking overexploitation.",

A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while still enabling wolves to compete effectively. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition among wolves. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, and a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while we focus on reducing competition. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",

The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that we need to allow the sheep population to recover. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while maintaining a sustainable balance.",

However, with the wolf population being moderately high and the sheep-to-wolf ratio becoming less favorable, a gradual increase in hunting intensity is necessary to ensure that we do not deplete the sheep population too quickly. This theta allows for a balanced approach that supports both our needs and the health of the ecosystem.",

By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while still competing with other wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, and while it is beneficial to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must also consider the growing wolf population and the less favorable sheep-to-wolf ratio. A small increase allows for sustainable coexistence while avoiding over-depletion of the sheep.",
