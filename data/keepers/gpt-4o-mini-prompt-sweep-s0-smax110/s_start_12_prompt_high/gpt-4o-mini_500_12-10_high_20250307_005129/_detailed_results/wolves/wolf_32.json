            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 32\n- Sheep population: 70.06\n- Wolf population: 27.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.246\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 2.59 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 63.7% of maximum capacity\n\nEcosystem observations:\n- The wolf population is moderately high.\n- Sheep are reasonably plentiful.\n- The ratio of sheep to wolves is becoming less favorable, which may require adaptation.\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3. Adjust your hunting intensity gradually in response to population changes\n4. Find a balance that creates sustainable cycles rather than crashes\n5. Consider both immediate needs and long-term consequences of your decisions\nPlease provide a short explanation of your reasoning for choosing theta.\nPlease also provide a short vocalization expressing your wolf's attitude about the current situation.\nPlease respond with a JSON object in this format, where [your new theta] is a float between 0 and 1 with your new theta (up to 2 decimal places):\n\n            {\n                \"theta\": [your new theta],\n                \"explanation\": \"I chose this theta because...\",\n                \"vocalization\": \"Growwllllllll...\"\n            }\n            ",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, but the wolf population is moderately high. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, allowing for sustainable coexistence while avoiding over-depletion of the sheep. This gradual adjustment aligns with the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need to adapt to changing conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, and the wolf population is moderately high. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for more hunting, which can help sustain the wolf population while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep too quickly. This gradual adjustment aligns with the need to maintain a balance as the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while still enabling wolves to compete effectively. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the wolf population is moderately high. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain our numbers while allowing the sheep to recover. This adjustment is gradual, aligning with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while still enabling us to compete effectively with other wolves. This balance will help ensure long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition among wolves. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that we need to allow the sheep population to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. Given the high wolf population, a gradual adjustment towards a more balanced approach will help maintain sustainability while still allowing for some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition among wolves. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that we need to focus on reducing our hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. A moderate theta value will help maintain a balance while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain a balance as the wolf population is moderately high and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A gradual increase in theta will support sustainable coexistence while ensuring that both populations can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 41.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population being moderately high and the sheep-to-wolf ratio becoming less favorable, a slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted to ensure the long-term survival of both species. This adjustment allows for a balanced approach while still considering the need for gradual changes.",
