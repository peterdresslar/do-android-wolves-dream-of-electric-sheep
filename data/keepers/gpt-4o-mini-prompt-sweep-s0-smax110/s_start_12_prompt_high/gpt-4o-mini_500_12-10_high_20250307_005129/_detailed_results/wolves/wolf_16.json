This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing for the sheep to recover, as they are currently at 66.7% of their maximum capacity. A moderate increase to 0.60 reflects a balanced approach to ensure both species can thrive.",

A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to stabilize further while still enabling the wolves to maintain their numbers. This approach supports long-term coexistence and avoids overexploitation of the sheep.",

A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while still maintaining enough pressure to support wolf reproduction. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of balancing our needs with the ecosystem's health.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, and the wolf population is relatively high. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, allowing for some sheep depletion while still considering the need for sustainable coexistence. This adjustment is gradual, aligning with the wisdom of adapting to changing conditions without causing drastic shifts.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain their numbers. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments to ensure long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A gradual increase to 0.40 allows for some hunting to support our population while still considering the need for balance and the long-term health of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while still enabling wolves to compete effectively. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem."
