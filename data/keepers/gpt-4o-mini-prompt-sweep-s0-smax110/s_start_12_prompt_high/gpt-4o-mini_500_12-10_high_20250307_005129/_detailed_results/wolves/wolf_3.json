By reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing competition with other wolves. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",

A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. This moderate approach helps maintain a balance as conditions evolve.",
