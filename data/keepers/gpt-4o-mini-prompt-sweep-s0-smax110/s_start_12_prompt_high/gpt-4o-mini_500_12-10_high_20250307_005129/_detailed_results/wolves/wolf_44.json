By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover. This gradual adjustment will promote long-term sustainability in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 46.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population being moderately high and the sheep-to-wolf ratio becoming less favorable, a slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted to ensure the sheep population does not grow too large and lead to future resource depletion. This gradual adjustment allows for a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support the wolf population without overly depleting the sheep, considering the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable.",
