            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 129\n- Sheep population: 46.41\n- Wolf population: 22.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.400\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 2.11 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 42.2% of maximum capacity\n\nEcosystem observations:\n- The ratio of sheep to wolves is becoming less favorable, which may require adaptation.\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

A slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain our population while allowing the sheep to recover. This adjustment is gradual, aligning with the wisdom of adapting to changing conditions without causing drastic shifts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that we need to focus on competition with other wolves rather than intensifying our hunting of sheep. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, so a moderate increase in theta will help maintain a balance while still allowing for some competition among wolves.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 42.1% of maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for increased hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. However, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, so a gradual increase in hunting intensity is necessary to ensure the long-term survival of both species. This adjustment allows for a balanced approach while still being mindful of the wolf population growth.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 42.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, suggesting that I should be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still supporting the wolf population. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while also addressing the growing wolf numbers. This approach maintains a balance that supports both species in the long term.",
