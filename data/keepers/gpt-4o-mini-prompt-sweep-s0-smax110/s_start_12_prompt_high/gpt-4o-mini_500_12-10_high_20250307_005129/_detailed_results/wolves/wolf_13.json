            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 24\n- Sheep population: 66.43\n- Wolf population: 7.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.763\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 9.49 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 60.4% of maximum capacity\n\nEcosystem observations:\n- The wolf population is relatively low, which may present opportunities for growth.\n- Sheep are reasonably plentiful.\n- There are many sheep per wolf, suggesting the ecosystem could support more hunting.\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

This adjustment supports the growth of our wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover if needed.

Maintaining a theta of 0.60 will enable me to continue hunting effectively while ensuring that the sheep population does not deplete too quickly. This moderate intensity supports both the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction without risking over-depletion of the sheep population. A moderate approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",

A moderate increase to 0.60 aligns with the current conditions and the need for sustainable coexistence.",

With the wolf population moderately high, a slight reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain sustainability while still allowing for some reproduction. This adjustment aligns with the need to adapt to the changing sheep-to-wolf ratio.",

However, with the wolf population being moderately high and the sheep-to-wolf ratio becoming less favorable, a slight reduction in hunting intensity is necessary to allow for recovery and maintain balance in the ecosystem.

To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on a balanced approach that allows for some hunting while also considering the need for sheep recovery. A slight decrease from my previous theta will help maintain this balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while still enabling wolves to compete effectively. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition among wolves. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, and while my hunting intensity needs to increase slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must also be cautious due to the high wolf population and the decreasing sheep-to-wolf ratio. A gradual increase allows for sustainable coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the current wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that we need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while gradually adjusting to the changing conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain the balance between wolf and sheep populations while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep. A gradual increase in theta reflects the need to adapt to the changing conditions without risking a crash in either population.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, and while it is important to increase hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must also consider the growing wolf population and the need to maintain a sustainable balance. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting while still prioritizing the long-term health of both species.",
