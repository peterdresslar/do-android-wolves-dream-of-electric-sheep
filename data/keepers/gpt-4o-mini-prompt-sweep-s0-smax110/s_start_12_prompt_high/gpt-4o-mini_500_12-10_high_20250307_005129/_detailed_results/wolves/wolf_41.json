However, the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A theta of 0.68 allows for sustainable hunting while also considering the need to maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 54.57, but the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A moderate hunting intensity will allow for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves. This adjustment helps to balance the ecosystem without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that increased competition among wolves may be necessary. A moderate hunting intensity will allow for some sheep population recovery while still enabling wolves to thrive. This approach balances immediate needs with long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that we need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover while still maintaining a presence in the hunting cycle. A moderate theta value will help balance our needs with the sustainability of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.8% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. The wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, so a gradual increase to 0.40 will help sustain both populations without over-depleting the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while still enabling wolves to maintain their numbers. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to recover while ensuring our own long-term survival.",

However, the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight increase in hunting intensity allows for better reproduction while still considering the need for balance and avoiding over-depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while the wolf population is moderately high, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain the balance without depleting the sheep too quickly, allowing for gradual adaptation to the changing conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while still enabling wolves to compete effectively. This approach aligns with the wisdom of making gradual adjustments to maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem. This gradual adjustment will help prevent overhunting and ensure long-term survival for both species.",
