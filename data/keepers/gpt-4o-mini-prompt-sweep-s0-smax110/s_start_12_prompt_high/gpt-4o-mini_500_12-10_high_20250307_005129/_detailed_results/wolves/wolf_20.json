            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 52\n- Sheep population: 37.57\n- Wolf population: 23.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.450\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 1.63 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 34.2% of maximum capacity\n\nEcosystem observations:\n- The ratio of sheep to wolves is becoming less favorable, which may require adaptation.\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3. Adjust your hunting intensity gradually in response to population changes\n4. Find a balance that creates sustainable cycles rather than crashes\n5.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful at 75.59, allowing for a more intense hunting strategy that can support wolf reproduction. However, I want to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly, so I am making a moderate adjustment from my previous theta of 0.972 to ensure a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity while still ensuring the sustainability of both sheep and wolf populations. This adjustment reflects a balance between competing with other wolves and hunting, promoting healthy reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful at 75.40, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help sustain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover and thrive. A gradual increase is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful at 73.32, which allows for a balanced approach to hunting. Maintaining a theta of 0.60 supports sustainable coexistence while still enabling some hunting to ensure the wolf population remains healthy. This gradual adjustment helps avoid depleting the sheep too quickly and allows for a stable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment helps ensure the wolf population remains healthy without depleting the sheep too quickly, considering the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, and while it is beneficial to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious due to the growing wolf population and the unfavorable sheep-to-wolf ratio. A gradual adjustment allows for sustainable coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while still keeping the wolf population stable. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 52.1% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. The wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A gradual increase to 0.40 allows for sustainable coexistence while still being cautious about overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that a more cautious approach to hunting is necessary to allow the sheep population to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. This moderate theta value will help balance our needs and ensure sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition among wolves. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, and a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while we adapt to the current conditions. This gradual approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, and while there is a need to increase hunting slightly to support wolf reproduction, the high wolf population suggests that competition is also a concern. A gradual increase to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach that supports both populations without risking depletion of the sheep.",

A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while still maintaining enough pressure to support wolf reproduction. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover. This gradual adjustment will promote a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 39.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain the balance without depleting the sheep too quickly or risking overpopulation of wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain the balance between the wolf and sheep populations while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep. Given the moderately high wolf population, a gradual increase in hunting will support our reproductive needs without risking a crash in the sheep population.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, and while it is beneficial to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious due to the relatively high wolf population. A small increase to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach that can help sustain both populations without risking a depletion of sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the wolf population is moderately high.
