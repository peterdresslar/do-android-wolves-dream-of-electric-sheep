A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, enabling the sheep to recover while still ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. This gradual adjustment helps maintain a sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, and while the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, a slight increase in hunting intensity will allow for some growth in the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. This adjustment supports a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment reflects the need to respond to the decreasing sheep-to-wolf ratio while still prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that we need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensifying our hunting. This will allow the sheep population to recover while we maintain our own numbers. A gradual adjustment helps ensure sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 52.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, so a gradual increase in hunting intensity is necessary to ensure the wolf population remains healthy without depleting the sheep too quickly. This adjustment allows for a balanced approach that supports both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, and while the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, a slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain our wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. This gradual adjustment allows for a sustainable balance as we adapt to the changing conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, and the wolf population is also relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity slightly to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining enough hunting to support our pack",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while still enabling us to compete effectively with other wolves. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of making gradual changes to maintain balance.",
