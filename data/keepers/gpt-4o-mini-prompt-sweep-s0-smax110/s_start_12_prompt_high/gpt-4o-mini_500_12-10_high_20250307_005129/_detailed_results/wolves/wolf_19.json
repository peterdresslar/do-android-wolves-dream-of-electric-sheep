Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3. Adjust your hunting intensity gradually in response to population changes\n4. Find a balance that creates sustainable cycles rather than crashes\n5.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep do not become over-depleted. A gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful at 76.12, which allows for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while still ensuring the sheep can recover. This adjustment reflects a balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep, promoting sustainability in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a sustainable balance. This adjustment reflects the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need to ensure both populations can thrive without depleting resources too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful at 73.32, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still maintaining a sustainable balance, as the sheep population is not yet at maximum capacity. A moderate increase to 0.60 allows for growth without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help sustain both the wolf and sheep populations without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the wolf population moderately high and the sheep-to-wolf ratio becoming less favorable, a slight reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain sustainability while still allowing for some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still recovering and is at 57.5% of its maximum capacity. While the wolf population is moderately high, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow sheep to stabilize while still enabling wolves to thrive. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, and while it is beneficial to hunt to support our reproduction, the wolf population is also relatively high. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, allowing the sheep to recover while preventing overcompetition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition among wolves. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that we need to allow the sheep population to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while also allowing for a gradual adjustment to the changing conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 47.7% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep. Given the high wolf population, a gradual adjustment is necessary to avoid over-depletion of sheep and to maintain sustainable coexistence.",
