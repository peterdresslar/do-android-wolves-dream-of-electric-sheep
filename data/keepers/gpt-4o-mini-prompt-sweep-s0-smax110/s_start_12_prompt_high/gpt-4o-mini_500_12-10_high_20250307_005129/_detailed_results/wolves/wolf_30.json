            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain our wolf population while also considering the need for sheep recovery. A gradual increase in theta will help us adapt to the changing sheep-to-wolf ratio without causing a sudden depletion of the sheep.",

However, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, suggesting that I should be cautious about hunting too aggressively. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while still enabling the wolf population to thrive.",

A slight reduction in hunting will allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population.",

A lower theta allows the sheep to recover while we adapt to the changing conditions, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
