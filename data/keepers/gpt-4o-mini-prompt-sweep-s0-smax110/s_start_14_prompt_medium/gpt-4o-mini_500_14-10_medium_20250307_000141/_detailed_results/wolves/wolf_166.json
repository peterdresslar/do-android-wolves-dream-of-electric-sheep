            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 193\n- Sheep population: 13.67\n- Wolf population: 45.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.350\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.30 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 12.4% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring both populations can thrive without depleting resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and while it is important to maintain a healthy wolf population, I need to ensure that the sheep have enough time to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help balance the ecosystem while still allowing for some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 96.75, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 45.00, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for some hunting without risking depletion. However, with the wolf population also present, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This will help support wolf reproduction while still maintaining a healthy sheep population. The gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of balancing competition with hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 50.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.83, it is wise to maintain a moderate hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while also ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. This small adjustment will help balance our needs without risking depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover gradually.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 29.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 70, I need to be cautious about overhunting. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow sheep to recover while still enabling wolves to maintain a healthy population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.97, which is only 23.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still being mindful of the wolf population growth.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.75, which is only 18.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to allow for sheep recovery. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the long-term balance between wolf and sheep populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.89, which is only 16.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain my pack without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting both wolf reproduction and sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.32, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 strikes a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep can rebound, promoting long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.67, which is only 12.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach to hunting while still considering the need to compete with other wolves. This gradual adjustment helps maintain the delicate balance of the ecosystem."
