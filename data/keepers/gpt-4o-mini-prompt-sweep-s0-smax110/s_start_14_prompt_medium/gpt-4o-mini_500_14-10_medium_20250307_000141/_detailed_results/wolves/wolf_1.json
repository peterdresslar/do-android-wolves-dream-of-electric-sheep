            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.00, which is only 12.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because it represents a balanced approach to hunting and competition. The sheep population is currently low, allowing for some increased hunting without risking depletion. However, with a wolf population of 9, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.53, which is only 14.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, focusing on maintaining the wolf population while still enabling some hunting."
