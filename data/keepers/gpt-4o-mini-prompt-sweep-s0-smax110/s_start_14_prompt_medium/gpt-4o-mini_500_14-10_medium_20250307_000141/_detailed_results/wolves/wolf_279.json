A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help ensure the sheep can recover while still allowing for some hunting to support the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly, considering the current trends in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term health of both sheep and wolves. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to ensure that we do not deplete the sheep population too quickly, especially considering the current wolf population is relatively high.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.23, which is only 24.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for sustainable hunting without risking depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for more hunting to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious to avoid overexploitation. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.60, which is only 19.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance."
