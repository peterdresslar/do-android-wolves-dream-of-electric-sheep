            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 86.9% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 46, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 75.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still a healthy number of sheep available. However, with the wolf population at 54, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term survival of both species. This moderate adjustment will help maintain balance and prevent over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help sustain our wolf population while still allowing sheep to recover gradually.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the wolf population is relatively high. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling us to maintain our numbers. This balance is crucial for long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.65, which is only 31.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some reproduction among wolves while still enabling the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting sustainability without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.23, which is only 24.8% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure that my pack can thrive, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease from my previous theta of 0.450 will help balance the competition among wolves while still allowing for some hunting. This approach supports sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.60, which is only 19.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach that supports both wolf reproduction and sheep recovery, while still being cautious not to overhunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.91, which is only 16.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring a balance that promotes the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.50, which is only 14.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted to help sustain wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A gradual increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, avoiding overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.55, which is only 12.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without risking a rapid depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.45, which is only 11.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the balance needed for long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.61, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without risking a rapid depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.05, which is only 10.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own population. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, allowing both sheep and wolves to thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.88, which is only 9.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while allowing the sheep population to stabilize."
