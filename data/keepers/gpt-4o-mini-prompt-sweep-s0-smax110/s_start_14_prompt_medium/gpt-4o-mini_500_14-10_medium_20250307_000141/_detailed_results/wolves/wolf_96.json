            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating a need for careful management to prevent depletion. A slight reduction in hunting intensity allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves. This balance will help maintain both populations over the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and while I need to maintain hunting to support wolf reproduction, I must also be cautious not to deplete the sheep too quickly. A slight reduction from my previous theta allows for a more balanced approach, ensuring both populations can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and while I want to ensure the survival of both wolves and sheep, a moderate hunting intensity will allow for sustainable coexistence. This adjustment balances the need for wolf reproduction with the necessity of not depleting the sheep population too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that we can afford to hunt a bit more without risking depletion. However, with the wolf population also being relatively stable, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 88.5% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balanced approach. This will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, as it allows for sustainable coexistence without depleting the sheep population too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 86.56, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while it is beneficial to maintain some hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I want to ensure that we do not deplete the sheep too quickly. A slight reduction from my previous theta allows for a more balanced approach, considering the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need for long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports both the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 67.00, I need to be cautious about overhunting. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover gradually.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 29.93, which is only 27.2% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.69, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.30, which is only 18.5% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, allowing both populations to stabilize without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.94, which is only 15.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some reproduction among wolves while still enabling the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 allows for a balanced approach that supports both populations without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.08, which is only 13.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species."
