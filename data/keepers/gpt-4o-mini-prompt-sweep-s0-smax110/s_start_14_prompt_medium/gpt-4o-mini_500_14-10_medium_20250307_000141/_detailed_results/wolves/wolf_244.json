            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 96.55, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover if needed. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for moderate hunting without risking depletion. This balance will help maintain our wolf population while ensuring the sheep can recover and thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports both wolf reproduction and sheep recovery. This balance helps ensure the long-term survival of both populations while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity slightly to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining enough hunting to support our pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a balance as the sheep population is recovering, while also considering the growing wolf population. A gradual increase in theta will support sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level relative to its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A slight decrease from my previous theta will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can stabilize and grow.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.59, which is only 25.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the immediate needs of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.27, which is only 20.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is potential for recovery in the sheep population. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity from 0.450 to 0.40, I can allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of avoiding sudden changes and supports long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.38, which is only 16.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.81, which is only 14.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack without depleting the sheep further, promoting a healthier balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.05, which is only 12.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain our wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing our immediate needs.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.62, which is only 11.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, reducing hunting intensity while still enabling some reproduction among wolves. This strategy supports long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.82, which is only 10.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting without risking the sheep",

This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity from 0.40 to 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.89, which is only 9.9% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, a slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted to take advantage of the current sheep population without depleting it too quickly.
