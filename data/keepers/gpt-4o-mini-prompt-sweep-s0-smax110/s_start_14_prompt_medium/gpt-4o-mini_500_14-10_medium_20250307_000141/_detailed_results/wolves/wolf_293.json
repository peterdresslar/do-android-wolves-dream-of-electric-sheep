            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. A moderate theta value will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can stabilize, promoting long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 3.67, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and a slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain the balance without depleting the sheep too quickly. This moderate adjustment allows for sustainable coexistence while ensuring the wolf population remains healthy.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is close to its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a sustainable balance. This adjustment will help support the wolf population without risking a significant depletion of sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 86.9% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while maintaining a balance that prevents overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, but I need to be cautious about the wolf population growth. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still providing enough resources for the wolves. This approach aligns with maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment reflects a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 51.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 66, which is quite high relative to the sheep, I need to focus on maintaining balance. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to thrive without over-depleting the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment helps maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term survival for both.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the wolf population is relatively high. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still providing enough resources for the wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.23, which is only 24.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I can increase my hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. A gradual increase to 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of the wolf pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.60, which is only 19.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 will help balance our hunting efforts with the need to compete with other wolves, ensuring both populations can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.91, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring both can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.50, which is only 14.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 reflects a slight increase in hunting compared to my previous value, allowing for some reproduction among wolves while being cautious not to deplete the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.55, which is only 12.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for gradual hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of my pack."
