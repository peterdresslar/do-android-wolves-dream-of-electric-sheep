            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 104.06, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking over-depletion. This value balances the need for wolf reproduction with the sustainability of the sheep population, aligning with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, and while I want to ensure the wolf population remains robust, I also need to allow the sheep to recover and thrive. A moderate hunting intensity will help maintain balance and prevent over-depletion of sheep while still supporting wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 80.21, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This approach balances the needs of both populations and avoids over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 59.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with the wolf population also being quite high, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure sustainable coexistence. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow for a balance that supports both populations without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term survival of both species. This moderate adjustment helps maintain a balance as the sheep population is recovering, and it allows for gradual adaptation to the changing conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 37.90, which is only 34.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is potential for recovery, I should avoid over-hunting to allow the sheep to stabilize. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 29.60, which is only 26.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting to maintain the wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that considers both the current state and the need for sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.26, which is only 21.1% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.35 aligns with the wisdom of making small adjustments while considering the current state of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.58, which is only 16.9% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.04, which is only 14.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need to adapt to the changing conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.87, which is only 12.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.400 to 0.35, I can maintain a focus on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring a balance that supports both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.63, which is only 11.5% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, a slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly. This moderate adjustment allows for sustainable coexistence while still addressing the needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.52, which is only 10.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.97, which is only 10.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover.
