            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 477\n- Sheep population: 12.63\n- Wolf population: 43.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.350\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.29 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 11.5% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that we can afford to hunt more intensely without depleting their numbers too quickly. However, I must also consider the growing wolf population and avoid overhunting, so a moderate increase in hunting intensity allows for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that a slight reduction in hunting intensity is necessary to prevent overexploitation. A moderate theta allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some hunting to support the wolf population. This approach balances the immediate need for food with the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and maintaining a moderate hunting intensity will allow for sustainable coexistence. This approach balances the need for wolf reproduction while ensuring that the sheep population can recover and thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, but I need to be cautious as the wolf population is also significant. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling us to compete effectively with other wolves. This approach supports long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain the wolf population while ensuring that sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of my ancestors, promoting a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 45.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 69, which is relatively high, I need to be cautious about overhunting. A theta of 0.35 allows for a slight focus on competition with other wolves while still enabling some hunting, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 37.90, which is only 34.5% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still being cautious. A moderate increase to 0.40 will help maintain a balance between hunting and allowing the sheep population to recover, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 29.60, which is only 26.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased slightly to support wolf reproduction, it is essential to maintain a balance to allow the sheep population to recover. A small increase to 0.45 allows for sustainable hunting while still being mindful of the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.26, which is only 21.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population and maintaining a balance with the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.58, which is only 16.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from the previous theta of 0.40 to 0.35, I can still maintain a focus on competition with other wolves while allowing for some sustainable hunting. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.04, which is only 14.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting without risking depletion. By increasing theta slightly from 0.35 to 0.40, I can maintain a balance that allows for some hunting while still considering the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep. This small adjustment aligns with the wisdom of making gradual changes in response to population dynamics.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low at 12.6% of its maximum capacity, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.63, which is only 11.5% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will enable me to hunt a bit more effectively while still prioritizing the sustainability of both populations. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance."
