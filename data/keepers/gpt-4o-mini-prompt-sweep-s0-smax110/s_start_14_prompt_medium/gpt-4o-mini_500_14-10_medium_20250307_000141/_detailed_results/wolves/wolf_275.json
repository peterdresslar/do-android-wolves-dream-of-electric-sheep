            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A lower theta will help reduce competition among wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively low. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep to recover while ensuring that our pack remains sustainable in the long run. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and my previous hunting intensity was already low. To allow the sheep to recover and prevent overexploitation, I will focus more on competing with other wolves. This will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem while ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
