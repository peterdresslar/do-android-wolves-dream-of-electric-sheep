A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help sustain the wolf population while allowing for gradual recovery of the sheep. This approach balances the immediate need for food with the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to prevent depletion. A slight reduction in hunting will allow for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A balanced approach will help maintain both wolf and sheep populations sustainably, avoiding depletion of the sheep while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. A moderate theta value will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can stabilize, preventing future crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a high availability of prey. However, to ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover. This will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to depletion. A moderate approach allows for some hunting while giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that they can sustain some increased hunting pressure without immediate risk of depletion. However, I must remain cautious and avoid drastic changes, so a moderate increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach that supports both wolf reproduction and sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 96% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing sheep to recover. A moderate increase to 0.45 reflects a balanced approach, promoting coexistence and sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 96.75, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term survival of both species. This moderate adjustment helps maintain a balance as the wolf population is also growing, ensuring that we do not over-deplete the sheep while allowing for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while still maintaining a sustainable balance with the sheep population. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need for gradual changes, a moderate increase is appropriate.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help support wolf reproduction while still ensuring that the sheep population can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is key to maintaining balance in the ecosystem.",

With the sheep population at 50.7% of maximum capacity, I can maintain a sustainable coexistence while ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. This adjustment allows for gradual hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly, which is crucial for long-term survival.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.36, which is only 29.4% of its maximum capacity. While I want to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, allowing both populations to stabilize without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.97, which is only 23.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.75, which is only 18.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring a sustainable balance between both populations.",
