            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 193\n- Sheep population: 13.67\n- Wolf population: 45.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.350\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.30 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 12.4% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and my previous theta was quite low. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I will gradually increase my hunting intensity while still focusing on competition with other wolves. This will allow the sheep to recover slightly while maintaining a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is very close to its maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 3.32, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 105.60, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations while avoiding overhunting, which could lead to depletion. A gradual increase in theta reflects the need to adapt to the current conditions without risking the long-term sustainability of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 96.75, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support the wolf population's growth without depleting the sheep too quickly. It's important to remain cautious and avoid drastic changes, so a gradual increase is the best approach.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 85.27, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance of the ecosystem. This moderate adjustment will help maintain the wolf population without over-depleting the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A gradual increase is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly and to maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 50.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.83, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery. A gradual increase is prudent to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.36, which is only 29.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it is essential to prioritize the recovery of the sheep population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.97, which is only 23.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of the wolf pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.75, which is only 18.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for sustenance with the long-term health of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and the wolf population is relatively high. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for more hunting to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep too quickly. This gradual adjustment helps maintain a balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.32, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more conservative approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain its health. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while prioritizing the long-term balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.67, which is only 12.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly."
