            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 210\n- Sheep population: 18.16\n- Wolf population: 6.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.450\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 3.03 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 16.5% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still enabling the sheep population to recover. A moderate approach ensures that we do not deplete the sheep too quickly, maintaining balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.97, which is only 23.6% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a moderate increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. A theta of 0.60 maintains a balance that encourages coexistence and prevents drastic fluctuations in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.75, which is only 18.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I can increase my hunting intensity, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still giving sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.89, which is only 16.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, a more moderate approach is prudent to allow the sheep to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring a balance that promotes long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.32, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach that encourages coexistence while still addressing the immediate needs of the wolf pack.",

A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need to compete with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.23, which is only 10.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help ensure the sheep population stabilizes while also allowing for a gradual adjustment in the wolf population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
