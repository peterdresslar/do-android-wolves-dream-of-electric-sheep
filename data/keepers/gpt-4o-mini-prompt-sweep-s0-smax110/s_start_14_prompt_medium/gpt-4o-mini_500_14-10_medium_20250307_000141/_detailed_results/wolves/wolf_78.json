To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover. A gradual increase in theta will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.20 will help maintain balance while still allowing for some hunting to support the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 15.71, it is crucial to avoid overhunting to ensure the long-term survival of both species. A gradual approach will help maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery. Maintaining the current theta will help prevent overhunting and ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, while also allowing for competition among wolves to stabilize our population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at maximum capacity, indicating that we should be cautious with our hunting to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta reflects a balanced approach, allowing for some hunting while still prioritizing the sustainability of both populations.",

To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves while allowing the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help maintain a sustainable balance without depleting the sheep further.",
