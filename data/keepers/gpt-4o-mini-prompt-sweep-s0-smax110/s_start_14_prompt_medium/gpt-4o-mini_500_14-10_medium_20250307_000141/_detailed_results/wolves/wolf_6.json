            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 12\n- Sheep population: 31.25\n- Wolf population: 4.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.400\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 7.81 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 28.4% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring both populations can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I want to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.53, which is only 14.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 allows for a balanced approach to hunting while still being mindful of the wolf population growth and the need for coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while I want to increase hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some growth in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and I want to gradually increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep to recover. This moderate increase reflects the need to adapt to the current conditions without risking a sudden depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and while it is important to hunt to support our wolf population, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance and prevent over-depletion of the sheep, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment reflects a balance between ensuring the wolf population can thrive while still allowing the sheep to recover and maintain their numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help ensure the wolf population remains healthy while still allowing the sheep to recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is key to maintaining balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate hunting approach. This will help maintain a balance between the wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term sustainability while still allowing for some hunting to support our pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain our wolf population while ensuring that the sheep do not become over-depleted. A gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of my ancestors, promoting a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 24.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, enabling us to maintain our wolf population while ensuring the sheep can recover. This adjustment is gradual, reflecting the need to adapt to the current conditions and trends.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 26.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with a relatively high sheep-to-wolf ratio of 7.22, I need to be cautious about overhunting. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, focusing on coexistence while still enabling some hunting to support our wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because it represents a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balanced approach. The sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for some increase in hunting to support wolf reproduction without risking a significant depletion of the sheep. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of adapting to population changes."
