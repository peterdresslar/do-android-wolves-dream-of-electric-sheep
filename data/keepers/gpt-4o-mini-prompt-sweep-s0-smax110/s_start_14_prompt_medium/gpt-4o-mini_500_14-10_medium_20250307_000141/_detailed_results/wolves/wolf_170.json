            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 194\n- Sheep population: 12.45\n- Wolf population: 40.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.400\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.31 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 11.3% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 105.60, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the balance between wolves and sheep. This moderate adjustment will help sustain both populations without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 96.75, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still being mindful of the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a sustainable balance. This adjustment reflects the need to support wolf reproduction without over-depleting the sheep population, which is crucial for long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term health of both the sheep and wolf populations. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to maintain balance as the sheep population is recovering, while also considering the growing wolf numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still considering the need to maintain a balance with the sheep population. A gradual increase is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 38.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a wolf population of 70, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is low, suggesting that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing competition with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.36, which is only 29.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting without risking depletion. Increasing theta slightly from 0.35 to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, enabling me to hunt more effectively while still considering the long-term survival of both sheep and wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.97, which is only 23.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the wolf population is relatively high. A lower theta allows for more competition among wolves, which can help stabilize our numbers while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.89, which is only 16.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the immediate needs of the wolf pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.67, which is only 12.4% of its maximum capacity. While I need to focus on hunting to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.45, which is only 11.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to allow for sheep recovery. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves to maintain a balanced ecosystem."
