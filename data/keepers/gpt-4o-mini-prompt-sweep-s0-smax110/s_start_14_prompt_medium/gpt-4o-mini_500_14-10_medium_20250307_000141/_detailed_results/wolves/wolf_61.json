            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for some increased hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will support wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sustainability. A moderate increase from my previous theta will help maintain balance as the sheep population is above 70% of its maximum capacity.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is necessary to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly, and this theta reflects a balanced approach.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for some hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. This adjustment maintains a balance between ensuring the wolf population can thrive while allowing the sheep to recover and sustain their population. A slight reduction from my previous theta reflects a cautious approach to avoid overhunting as the wolf population is relatively high.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 34.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, it is wise to avoid overhunting to prevent a crash in the sheep population. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring both populations can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and while we need to ensure our survival through hunting, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.74, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction. However, the wolf population is relatively high at 64, so I must be cautious not to overhunt and deplete the sheep further. A moderate increase to 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some growth in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.35, which is only 17.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a more balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to support reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.65, which is only 15.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for sustenance with the goal of long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.58, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.92, which is only 11.7% of its maximum capacity. Given the high wolf population of 43, it's essential to focus on competition among wolves to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 will help maintain a balance while still being cautious about overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.01, which is only 10.9% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, a slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted to take advantage of the current sheep availability without depleting them too quickly. This moderate adjustment allows for a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the wolf population is relatively high. A moderate hunting intensity allows for some hunting while giving sheep a chance to recover. This approach helps maintain a balance between both populations, ensuring long-term survival.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.80, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta value of 0.35 strikes a balance between competing with other wolves and allowing the sheep population to stabilize, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
