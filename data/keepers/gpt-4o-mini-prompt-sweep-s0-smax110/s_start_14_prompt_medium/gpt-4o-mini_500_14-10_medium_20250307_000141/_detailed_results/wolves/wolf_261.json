This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can recover, aligning with the wisdom of gradual changes.",

This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting a lower theta, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of sustainable coexistence.",
