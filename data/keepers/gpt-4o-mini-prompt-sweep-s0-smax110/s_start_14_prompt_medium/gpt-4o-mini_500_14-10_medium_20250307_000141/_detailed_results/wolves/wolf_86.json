Maintaining a focus on competition with other wolves will help stabilize our population while ensuring the sheep can bounce back in the future.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover and prevents overexploitation. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, while also allowing for gradual adjustments as conditions change.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for a focus on competition with other wolves, which can help stabilize the wolf population while giving sheep a chance to recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution in hunting to prevent depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the sustainability of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is high. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain balance and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and while I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta will enable some hunting while still prioritizing the balance needed for long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 3.93, focusing on competition with other wolves will help maintain a sustainable balance without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and while I want to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep too quickly. A small increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring both populations can thrive.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual increase in theta aligns with the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and promotes long-term balance.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the wolf population is relatively high. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow sheep to recover while still ensuring that wolves can thrive. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of making gradual changes to maintain balance.",

This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing competition among wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.69, which is only 22.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for more hunting to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious to avoid overexploitation.",
