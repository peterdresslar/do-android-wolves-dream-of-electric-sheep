            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 96.55, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment reflects a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover and maintain their population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 84.84, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity. This approach helps maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can recover. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need for sustainable coexistence, a slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a more cautious strategy while still supporting the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still maintaining a healthy sheep population. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need for gradual changes, 0.45 strikes a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep can recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, and the wolf population is relatively high. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling wolves to maintain their numbers. This approach supports a sustainable balance without risking a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This will help support wolf reproduction while still maintaining a balance that prevents over-depletion of the sheep population. A gradual adjustment is essential to ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 32.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.52, it is essential to maintain a balance that allows both populations to thrive. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can help the sheep recover while still ensuring the wolf population remains healthy.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.59, which is only 25.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for more hunting while still considering the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.27, which is only 20.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight reduction from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still enabling some hunting to support our population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.38, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking their depletion. This moderate increase will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring both can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.81, which is only 14.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, a more moderate approach is necessary to allow the sheep to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.05, which is only 12.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the immediate needs of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.62, which is only 11.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to allow the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 to 0.35 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for some hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.82, which is only 10.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting without risking depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still being mindful of the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.20, which is only 10.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack without depleting the sheep further, promoting a healthier balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.89, which is only 9.9% of its maximum capacity. A slight increase in hunting intensity from my previous theta of 0.35 will allow me to take advantage of the current sheep population while still being cautious. This moderate adjustment helps ensure that the sheep can recover over time and maintains a balance with the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.75, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover before intensifying our hunting. A moderate theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance, allowing for some hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of both populations."
