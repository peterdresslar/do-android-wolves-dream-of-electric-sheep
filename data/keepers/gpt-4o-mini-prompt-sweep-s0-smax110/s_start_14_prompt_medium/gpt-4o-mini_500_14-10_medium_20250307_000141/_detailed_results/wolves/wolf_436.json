            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that a more moderate hunting intensity is appropriate to allow for recovery while still supporting wolf reproduction. This adjustment balances the need for sustenance with the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. However, with the wolf population at a moderate level, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, but not at maximum capacity. A moderate hunting intensity will allow for sustainable coexistence while still enabling the wolf population to thrive. This adjustment is gradual, reflecting the need to balance both populations without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 72.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still a healthy number of sheep available. However, with the wolf population at 57, I need to be cautious about overhunting. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment also considers the growing wolf population, which requires a balanced approach to ensure both species can thrive together.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 45.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.72, it is important to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population. A lower theta will help reduce competition among wolves and give sheep a chance to increase their numbers, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a balance as the sheep population grows, while also considering the current wolf population, which is relatively high. A gradual increase in theta allows for adaptation to changing conditions without causing sudden shifts that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I need to maintain a balance, a slight increase in hunting intensity will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. This adjustment allows for a cautious approach to ensure both populations can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.26, which is only 21.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I need to maintain some hunting to support wolf reproduction, I should also be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a more balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for wolf population stability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.58, which is only 16.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta will help balance our needs without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.04, which is only 14.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for sustainable cycles.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.87, which is only 12.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.63, which is only 11.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for gradual hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.35 to 0.40, I can help ensure the wolf population remains healthy while still allowing the sheep to recover over time.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.52, which is only 10.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need to compete with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to support wolf reproduction."
