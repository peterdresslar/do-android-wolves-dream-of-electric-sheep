            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while also giving sheep a chance to recover. This balance helps ensure the long-term survival of both species without risking over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 41.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 70, which is relatively high, I need to balance hunting intensity to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight decrease in theta allows for some hunting while still giving sheep a chance to recover and ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment reflects a balanced approach, as the wolf population is also significant, and I want to ensure both species can thrive together. A gradual increase will help maintain the delicate ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.14, which is only 23.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.66, which is only 18.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is some opportunity for hunting, it is crucial to avoid overexploitation to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.35, which is only 15.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room to increase hunting intensity slightly without risking the depletion of the sheep population. A moderate increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still being mindful of the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.77, which is only 13.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By adopting a slightly lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.08, which is only 11.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some reproduction among wolves while still giving sheep a chance to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.93, which is only 10.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support our wolf population without risking a significant decline in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.20, which is only 10.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.74, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to stabilize while still competing with other wolves. This moderate approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.46, which is only 9.5% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity and promote a more sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.38, which is only 9.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to be cautious with our hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will enable me to maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.41, which is only 9.5% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach to hunting while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.49, which is only 9.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to allow the sheep to recover, so a lower hunting intensity will help sustain their numbers while we focus on competing with other wolves. This approach will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem and ensure both populations can thrive in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.73, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.04, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are fewer sheep available per wolf. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I will focus on reducing hunting intensity slightly to allow the sheep population to recover while still competing with other wolves.
