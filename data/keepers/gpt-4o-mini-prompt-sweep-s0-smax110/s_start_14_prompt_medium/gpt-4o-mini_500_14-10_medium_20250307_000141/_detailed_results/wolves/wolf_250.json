            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 77.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 53, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term health of both populations. This moderate adjustment helps maintain balance as the wolf population is also significant.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while I need to ensure my pack thrives, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance as the wolf population is relatively high. This approach supports long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level relative to its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are not enough sheep to support a high hunting intensity. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. This approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.59, which is only 25.1% of its maximum capacity. While I want to ensure my pack thrives, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease from my previous theta of 0.450 will help balance hunting intensity with the need for sheep population sustainability, promoting a healthier ecosystem overall.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.27, which is only 20.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our wolf population. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance and prevent over-depletion of sheep, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.38, which is only 16.7% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being mindful of the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.81, which is only 14.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.05, which is only 12.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.62, which is only 11.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can help the sheep population stabilize while still allowing for some hunting to maintain the wolf population. This approach aligns with my goal of ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.82, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a balance as the sheep population recovers while also considering the growing wolf population. A gradual increase in theta supports sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.20, which is only 10.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while maintaining a stable wolf population. A moderate theta value of 0.35 allows for some hunting without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.89, which is only 9.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be increased slightly to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A small increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.75, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need to compete with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to support our population."
