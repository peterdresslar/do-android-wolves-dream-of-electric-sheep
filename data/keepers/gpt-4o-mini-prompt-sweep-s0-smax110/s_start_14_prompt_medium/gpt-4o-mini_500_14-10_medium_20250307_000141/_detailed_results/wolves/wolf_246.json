            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 96.55, allowing for a moderate hunting approach. This value helps maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species. It allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while not over-depleting the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 84.84, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a sustainable balance. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 71.86, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we have enough prey to sustain our pack without overhunting. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a more cautious approach, ensuring that we do not deplete the sheep population while still allowing for some hunting to support our reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, promoting coexistence while ensuring our pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 41.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.67, I need to be cautious about hunting too aggressively to allow the sheep population to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance while still allowing for some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery. A moderate increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach to coexistence.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.27, which is only 20.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I can increase my hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate increase to 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.38, which is only 16.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to support our population without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.81, which is only 14.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for wolves to thrive.",

This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable, and while I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I should focus on allowing the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of both populations.",

While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will enable me to hunt more effectively while still prioritizing the sustainability of both populations. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
