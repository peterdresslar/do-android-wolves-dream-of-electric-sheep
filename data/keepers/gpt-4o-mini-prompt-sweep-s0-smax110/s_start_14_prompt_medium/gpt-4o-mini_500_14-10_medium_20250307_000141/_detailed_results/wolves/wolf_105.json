            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 126\n- Sheep population: 12.43\n- Wolf population: 37.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.350\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.34 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 11.3% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and maintain their numbers. A gradual adjustment is crucial to avoid destabilizing the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while ensuring that the sheep can recover. This adjustment supports the wolf population's growth without risking a rapid depletion of the sheep, maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 86.56, allowing for a moderate hunting approach. This value supports sustainable coexistence while also considering the growing wolf population. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach to ensure both populations can thrive without depleting resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. It reflects a cautious approach to ensure both populations can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still ensuring that the sheep population can recover and thrive. A gradual increase aligns with the current state of the ecosystem and avoids sudden changes that could destabilize the balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 67.00, it is wise to maintain a moderate hunting intensity to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly while still allowing for wolf reproduction. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the wolf population is relatively high. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still ensuring that the wolves can thrive. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from the previous theta, I can still maintain some reproduction among wolves while prioritizing the sustainability of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.69, which is only 22.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach, promoting both wolf reproduction and sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.30, which is only 18.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I need to hunt to sustain my pack, I should do so moderately to allow the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 will help maintain a balance between hunting and allowing the sheep to thrive, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.94, which is only 15.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to allow for recovery. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.08, which is only 13.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is potential for recovery if I reduce hunting intensity slightly. By increasing theta from 0.35 to 0.40, I can still maintain a focus on hunting while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.53, which is only 12.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 reflects a balanced approach, prioritizing coexistence and sustainability over immediate hunting intensity.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.43, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment helps maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can recover over time."
