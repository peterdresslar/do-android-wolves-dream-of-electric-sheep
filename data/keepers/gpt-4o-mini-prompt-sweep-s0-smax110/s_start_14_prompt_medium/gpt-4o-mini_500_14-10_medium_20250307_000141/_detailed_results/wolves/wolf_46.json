            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, and my previous theta was quite low. A gradual increase to 0.25 allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the recovery of sheep and maintaining a balance with the wolf population. This approach supports sustainable coexistence without risking a dramatic decline in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term survival for both.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, given the wolf population is also quite high, I want to ensure we don",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring the sheep can recover and thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the wolf population is relatively high. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain their numbers. This approach promotes a balanced ecosystem and avoids over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 29.55, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we are competing for limited resources. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while still enabling our pack to maintain a healthy balance. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of avoiding sudden changes and focusing on long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.74, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.35, which is only 17.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.65, which is only 15.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.58, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some reproduction among wolves while still giving sheep a chance to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure and promote a more sustainable balance, while still allowing for some competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.01, which is only 10.9% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting sustainable coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.29, which is only 10.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for the sheep to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This gradual adjustment helps maintain a balance in the ecosystem without risking a sudden depletion of sheep."
