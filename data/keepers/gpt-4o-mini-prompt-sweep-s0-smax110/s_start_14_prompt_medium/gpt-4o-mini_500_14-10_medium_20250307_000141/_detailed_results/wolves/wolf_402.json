            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly, and this balance will support long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.14, which is only 23.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some sheep recovery while also ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without risking a crash in sheep numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.66, which is only 18.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring the sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.35, which is only 15.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some reproduction among wolves while still giving sheep a chance to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach that considers both the current state of the ecosystem and the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.77, which is only 13.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from the previous theta of 0.40 to 0.35, I can still focus on competing with other wolves while allowing for some sustainable hunting. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.93, which is only 10.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is some room for hunting, we must be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach to hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.20, which is only 10.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.74, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to stabilize while still competing with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.46, which is only 9.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.38, which is only 9.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.30 to 0.35, I can still maintain some pressure on the sheep while being mindful of the need for their population to grow. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.41, which is only 9.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.35 to 0.40, I can still maintain some pressure on the sheep population while being mindful of the need for sustainability.
