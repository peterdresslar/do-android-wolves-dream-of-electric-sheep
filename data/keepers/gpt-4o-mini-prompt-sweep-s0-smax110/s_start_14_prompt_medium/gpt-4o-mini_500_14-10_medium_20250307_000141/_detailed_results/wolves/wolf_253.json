            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while it is beneficial to hunt to support wolf reproduction, I need to be cautious not to deplete the sheep too quickly. A slight reduction in hunting intensity allows for a balance that supports both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term survival of both species. This adjustment reflects a balanced approach to ensure that while I can support my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 41.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with a wolf population of 68, it is wise to maintain a moderate approach to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly while still allowing for some hunting to support our reproduction. This slight reduction from my previous theta allows for a balanced strategy that considers both immediate needs and long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 32.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 68, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure our long-term survival. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that supports both sheep recovery and wolf population stability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.59, which is only 25.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to allow for recovery. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the competition with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.27, which is only 20.2% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still being cautious. By raising theta from 0.35 to 0.40, I can support the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.38, which is only 16.7% of its maximum capacity. While I want to ensure the survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to be cautious about hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.4 will help maintain a balance while still allowing for some hunting.",

This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to help sustain wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still recognizing the need to adapt to the current conditions.",

This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.400 to 0.45, I can maintain a balance that allows for sustainable coexistence while still being mindful of the need to avoid overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.62, which is only 11.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population. This gradual adjustment will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep.",

By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring a balance that supports both populations in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.89, which is only 9.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is a need to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a slight focus on hunting to support the wolf population. A small increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while being mindful of the need for gradual adjustments.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.83, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and avoid overhunting, I will focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensifying my hunting. This will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.02, which is only 10% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is an opportunity to hunt, I should do so cautiously to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will help maintain a balance between hunting and ensuring the sheep population can grow, while also considering the rising wolf population."
