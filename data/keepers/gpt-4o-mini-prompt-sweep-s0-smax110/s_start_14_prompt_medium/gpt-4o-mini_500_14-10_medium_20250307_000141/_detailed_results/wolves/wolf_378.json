            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 398\n- Sheep population: 91.47\n- Wolf population: 50.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.190\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 1.83 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 83.2% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a gradual increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. With the sheep-to-wolf ratio being 1.83, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 70.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. A moderate increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the long-term health of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain our wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual approach is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly, especially as the wolf population is slightly higher than the ideal balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while it is beneficial to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must also consider the growing wolf population. A moderate adjustment allows for a balance that supports both species without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.22, which is only 31.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from the previous theta of 0.40, I can help ensure a sustainable balance while being cautious not to overhunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.14, which is only 23.8% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 will help balance my focus between hunting and competing with other wolves, promoting sustainability in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.66, which is only 18.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. By increasing my theta slightly from 0.35 to 0.40, I can enhance hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.35, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a significant competition among wolves. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help sustain my pack while allowing the sheep population to recover gradually. This moderate adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining balance and responding to current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.77, which is only 13.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to allow for some recovery of the sheep population while still ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.08, which is only 11.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack without depleting the sheep further, promoting a balance that can lead to long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.93, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low at 0.29. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep population to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competition with other wolves while ensuring that the sheep have a chance to increase in number, which will ultimately benefit the wolf population in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.20, which is only 10.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be slightly increased to support wolf reproduction, it is crucial to avoid overhunting to allow the sheep population to recover. A gradual increase to 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for sustenance with the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.74, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to be cautious with our hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, enabling us to maintain our wolf population while still being mindful of the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.46, which is only 9.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to stabilize while still competing with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem."
