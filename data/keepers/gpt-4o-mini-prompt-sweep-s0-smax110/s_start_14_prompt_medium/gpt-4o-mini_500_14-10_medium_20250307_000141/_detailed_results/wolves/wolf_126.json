Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need for sustainable coexistence, a gradual increase in hunting is appropriate.",

This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sustainable coexistence. A gradual increase is wise to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",

This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.69, which is only 22.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.30, which is only 18.5% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity slightly. This will allow the sheep population to recover while also managing competition with other wolves. A gradual adjustment helps maintain balance without risking a crash in either population.",
