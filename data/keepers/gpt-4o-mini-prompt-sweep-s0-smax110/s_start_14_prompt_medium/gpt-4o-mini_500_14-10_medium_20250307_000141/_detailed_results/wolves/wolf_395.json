            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 400\n- Sheep population: 60.26\n- Wolf population: 66.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.968\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.91 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 54.8% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for some increased hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sustainable coexistence. A gradual increase in hunting intensity is warranted as the sheep population is above 50% of its maximum capacity, but I must remain cautious to avoid overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still ensuring that the sheep population can recover and thrive. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the trends in both populations, a gradual increase in hunting will help maintain balance without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 31.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain our wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover gradually.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.14, which is only 23.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is an opportunity to hunt, I need to be cautious and avoid over-depleting the sheep. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, enabling some hunting while still giving sheep a chance to recover. This strategy supports the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.66, which is only 18.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a lower hunting intensity is necessary to allow the sheep to recover. By adopting a moderate theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some sustainable hunting, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.35, which is only 15.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the immediate needs of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.77, which is only 13.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I need to maintain a focus on hunting to support the wolf population, I must also be cautious to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term balance of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.08, which is only 11.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and promotes long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.93, which is only 10.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for some hunting without risking the depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.20, which is only 10.2% of its maximum capacity. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover while also addressing the competition with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.74, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be slightly increased to support wolf reproduction, it is crucial to avoid overhunting to allow the sheep population to recover. A small increase to 0.35 reflects a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while being mindful of the delicate ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.46, which is only 9.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is an opportunity to increase hunting intensity slightly without risking the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.38, which is only 9.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can help ensure the sheep population stabilizes while still allowing for some hunting to maintain the wolf population. This moderate approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.41, which is only 9.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is a need for cautious hunting to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting sustainability without risking a depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.49, which is only 9.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.04, which is only 10% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.47, which is only 10.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to allow for recovery.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.98, which is only 10.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some reproduction among wolves while still giving sheep a chance to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without risking the depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.49, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance.
