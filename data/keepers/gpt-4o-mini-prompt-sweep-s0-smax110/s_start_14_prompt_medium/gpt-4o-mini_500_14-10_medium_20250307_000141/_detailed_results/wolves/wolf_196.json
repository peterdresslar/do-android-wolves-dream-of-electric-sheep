            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 185\n- Sheep population: 71.04\n- Wolf population: 61.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.963\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 1.16 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 64.6% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

However, I must remain cautious as the wolf population is also significant at 61.00. This theta allows for a balance between hunting and maintaining the sheep population, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 50.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for increased hunting without risking depletion. However, with the wolf population at 67, which is relatively high, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A moderate increase to 0.75 allows for sustainable hunting while still considering the long-term balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still maintaining a balance that prevents over-depletion of the sheep. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the trends in both populations, a moderate increase is prudent to ensure long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 29.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 70, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both species can thrive. A moderate increase in hunting intensity allows for a balance that supports wolf reproduction while giving sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.97, which is only 23.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.75, which is only 18.9% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.89, which is only 16.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need to adapt to the changing conditions of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.32, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 represents a slight increase in hunting compared to my previous value, acknowledging the need for some hunting to support wolf reproduction, while still prioritizing the sustainability of the sheep population.",

A moderate theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while giving sheep a chance to recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.72, which is only 10.7% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensifying hunting. This will help maintain a balance and prevent the sheep population from depleting further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.23, which is only 10.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.30 to 0.35, I can still focus on competition with other wolves while allowing for some hunting to support my pack",

This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance, ensuring that we do not deplete the sheep further while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.92, which is only 9.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",

A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.11, which is only 10.1% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover while still ensuring the wolf population remains stable, a lower theta value will help reduce hunting intensity and promote coexistence. This gradual adjustment will help maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.46, which is only 10.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach while still being mindful of the need to avoid overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance while still considering the need for wolves to thrive. This approach supports sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we are nearing a critical point for both populations. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help sustain our wolf population while allowing for gradual recovery of the sheep. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and responding to the current state of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.82, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion.
