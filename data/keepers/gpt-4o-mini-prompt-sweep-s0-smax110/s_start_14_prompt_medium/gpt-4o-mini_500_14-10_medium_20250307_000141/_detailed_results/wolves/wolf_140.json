            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 90.4% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This approach balances the needs of both populations and avoids over-depletion of sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and while I want to increase hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively low. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition with other wolves. This gradual adjustment helps maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. With a high sheep-to-wolf ratio and a growing wolf population, it\u2019s crucial to focus on competition among wolves rather than depleting the sheep further. This approach will help maintain balance and ensure long-term survival for both species.",
