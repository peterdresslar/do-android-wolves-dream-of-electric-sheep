            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 56\n- Sheep population: 12.01\n- Wolf population: 38.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.350\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.32 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 10.9% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still healthy at 93.7% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help ensure the wolf population can thrive while still allowing the sheep to recover and maintain a sustainable balance. A gradual adjustment is key to avoiding overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while still ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 79.22, which allows for a moderate hunting intensity. This will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring that we can sustain our pack while allowing the sheep to recover and thrive. A slight decrease from my previous theta will help prevent overhunting as the wolf population is also significant.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity while still ensuring their recovery. This balance helps maintain both wolf and sheep populations sustainably, avoiding overhunting while adapting to the current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicating a potential strain on resources, a slight reduction in hunting intensity will help ensure the sheep can recover while still allowing for wolf reproduction. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 34.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.55, it is essential to maintain a balance that allows both populations to thrive. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity from 0.45 to 0.40, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing the sheep population to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 29.55, which is only 26.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I can increase my hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate increase to 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.74, which is only 21.6% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A lower theta value will help reduce hunting intensity and give sheep a chance to increase their numbers, while also allowing for some competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.35, which is only 17.6% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, a slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted to take advantage of the available sheep without depleting them too quickly. This adjustment allows for a more balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.65, which is only 15.1% of its maximum capacity. A moderate hunting intensity allows for some hunting while still giving the sheep a chance to recover. This approach balances the needs of the wolf population with the sustainability of the sheep, ensuring both can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.58, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need to compete with other wolves as their population is relatively high.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.92, which is only 11.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that can help both populations stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.01, which is only 10.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still being mindful of the wolf population growth."
