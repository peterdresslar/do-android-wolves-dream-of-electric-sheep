A moderate theta allows for some hunting while also enabling the sheep population to recover and ensuring the wolf population remains stable.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 67.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain the balance between wolf and sheep populations while allowing for gradual recovery if needed. This approach aligns with the wisdom of adapting to changing conditions without making sudden, drastic changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, but the wolf population is also quite high. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain their numbers.

A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow sheep to recover while still ensuring that wolves can thrive. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 29.93, which is only 27.2% of its maximum capacity.

A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our wolf population without depleting the sheep further, promoting a balanced ecosystem.",

This suggests that there is room to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction while still allowing sheep to recover. A moderate increase to 0.40 maintains a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability.",
