            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery. A gradual increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. A lower theta will help maintain a balance, ensuring that both sheep and wolves can thrive in the long term while avoiding depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and a slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep too quickly. This moderate approach allows for sustainable coexistence while also considering the current wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while ensuring the sheep can recover. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 94.40, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 48.00, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a sustainable balance. This adjustment reflects the need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy without over-depleting the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment reflects the need to balance our wolf population while ensuring the sheep can recover and thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both populations. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to ensure that the sheep can recover while also allowing the wolf population to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 34.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a wolf population of 70, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is low, suggesting that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. This will help ensure the long-term survival of both species and avoid depleting the sheep population too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 29.60, which is only 26.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.26, which is only 21.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is some room for increased hunting, it is crucial to avoid overexploitation. A moderate increase to 0.45 allows for a slight boost in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being mindful of the sheep population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.58, which is only 16.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can grow, promoting long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.04, which is only 14.6% of maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of the wolf pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.87, which is only 12.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 to 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for wolf survival while ensuring the sheep population can stabilize and grow."
