            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at its maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. A lower theta will help maintain the balance between wolves and sheep, ensuring long-term survival for both species while preventing overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at maximum capacity, and maintaining a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover and prevent overexploitation. This approach also helps to stabilize the wolf population as we compete with each other, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery. Maintaining a lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, as it prevents overhunting and promotes a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 3.55, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is very close to its maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. This will help maintain a sustainable balance between the wolf and sheep populations while also considering the current growth of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while ensuring that we do not over-deplete their numbers. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and sustaining the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 85.8% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 48, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment reflects the need to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A gradual increase is prudent given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the overall ecosystem health.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is crucial to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 45.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, which is relatively high, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting to support wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 34.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.54, it is crucial to maintain a balance that allows sheep to recover while also ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help sustain both populations without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 29.60, which is only 26.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the immediate needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.26, which is only 21.1% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, allowing both populations to stabilize without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.58, which is only 16.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.4 to 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need to compete with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to support reproduction.",
