            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 89.3% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help ensure the wolf population can thrive while still allowing the sheep to recover and maintain a sustainable balance. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 105.63, allowing for some increased hunting intensity without risking depletion. However, I want to be cautious and avoid overhunting, as the wolf population is small. A moderate increase from my previous theta allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to prevent depletion. A theta of 0.60 allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while ensuring that the sheep population can recover and maintain balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that we should not increase hunting intensity further. A moderate approach allows for some hunting while giving sheep a chance to recover and ensuring our wolf population remains stable. This balance is crucial for long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. A lower theta will help balance competition with other wolves while giving sheep a chance to rebound, ensuring long-term sustainability for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. With a high sheep-to-wolf ratio, focusing on competition with other wolves will help maintain a sustainable balance without depleting the sheep further.",

This approach also helps to stabilize the wolf population in the face of competition from other wolves.",

Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover while also keeping competition among wolves in check, ensuring our long-term survival.",

This adjustment will help maintain our wolf population while ensuring that we do not deplete the sheep too quickly. A gradual increase aligns with the current trends and promotes a sustainable balance.",
