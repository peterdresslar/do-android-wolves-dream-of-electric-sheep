            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still healthy at 96.75, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain our wolf population while ensuring that we do not over-deplete the sheep. A gradual adjustment is key to sustaining both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still above 75% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This balance helps maintain a sustainable ecosystem without risking a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while it is beneficial to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must also consider the long-term health of the sheep population. A moderate increase allows for a balance that can sustain both species without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. This will help maintain the sheep population while ensuring the wolf pack remains healthy. A slight reduction from my previous theta will also account for the growing wolf population, promoting coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the wolf population is relatively high. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still supporting the wolf population. This moderate approach helps maintain balance and avoids depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 29.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. With a wolf population of 70, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is low, suggesting that we should focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensifying hunting. This will allow the sheep to recover while maintaining our own population health.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.97, which is only 23.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need to compete with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.75, which is only 18.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 reflects a balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to support reproduction. This will help maintain a sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the wolf population is relatively high. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help sustain our population while allowing the sheep to recover gradually. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.32, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover while still ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.67, which is only 12.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting without risking depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the wolf population is relatively high. A moderate hunting intensity allows for some hunting while giving sheep a chance to recover. This approach helps maintain a balance between both populations and avoids over-depletion of sheep, ensuring long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.72, which is only 10.7% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and avoid depleting their numbers further, I will focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting. This will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem while ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.23, which is only 10.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.30 to 0.35, I can still maintain a focus on competition with other wolves while allowing for a small, sustainable hunt that won"
