            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while it is beneficial to maintain some hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I want to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight reduction from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring both populations can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 50.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 67, which is relatively high, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, enabling the sheep to recover while still supporting the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 38.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.60, it is essential to maintain a balanced approach to ensure the long-term survival of both populations. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 29.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 70, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both populations can thrive. A slight decrease in hunting intensity allows for some recovery of the sheep while still enabling the wolves to maintain a healthy presence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.97, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there is a need for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction. However, I must be cautious and avoid drastic changes, as the wolf population is also significant at 66.00. A gradual increase to 0.40 allows for sustainable hunting while still considering the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.75, which is only 18.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A slight increase in hunting intensity to 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep further, allowing for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.89, which is only 16.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.32, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A slight decrease from my previous theta will help balance our needs with the sustainability of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.67, which is only 12.4% of its maximum capacity.

A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach that supports wolf reproduction while still being mindful of the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.45, which is only 11.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This gradual adjustment helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.72, which is only 10.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach that supports wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.23, which is only 10.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a slight decrease in hunting while still allowing for some competition among wolves, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.02, which is only 10% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to allow for some recovery of the sheep population while still ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.92, which is only 9.9% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help balance the ecosystem without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.98, which is only 10.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting without risking immediate depletion. However, with the wolf population at 21.00, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the sustainability of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.11, which is only 10.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to stabilize while still competing with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.46, which is only 10.4% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still being cautious. A theta of 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, enabling me to support the wolf population",
