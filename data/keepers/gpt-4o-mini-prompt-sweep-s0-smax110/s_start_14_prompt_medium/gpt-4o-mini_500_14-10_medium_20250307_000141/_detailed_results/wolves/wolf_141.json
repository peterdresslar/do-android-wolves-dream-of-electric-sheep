            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 189\n- Sheep population: 25.97\n- Wolf population: 66.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.350\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.39 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 23.6% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that they can sustain some hunting pressure without immediate risk of depletion. However, with the wolf population being relatively low, I need to ensure that we do not overhunt and jeopardize our long-term survival. A moderate increase in hunting intensity allows for reproduction while still being mindful of the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that we should reduce hunting intensity to allow for recovery. A moderate theta value will help maintain a balance between our needs and the sustainability of the sheep population, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A moderate theta will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can stabilize, promoting long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. With a high sheep-to-wolf ratio, focusing on competition among wolves will help maintain our population while giving sheep a chance to rebound.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain balance and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively low. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also reducing competition among wolves. This approach supports long-term sustainability and prevents overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at its maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in sheep numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover and ensures the long-term survival of both species. It also helps to stabilize the wolf population as we adapt to the current conditions.",

Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition with other wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery. Maintaining a lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery. Maintaining a lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, as it allows the sheep population to stabilize while we focus on competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and hunting them aggressively could lead to depletion. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help maintain the sheep population while allowing for a gradual recovery. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both species.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be cautiously increased to maintain balance. However, given the current wolf population and the need to avoid over-depletion of sheep, a slight increase from my previous theta allows for sustainable hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and a slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep too quickly. This moderate adjustment allows for sustainable coexistence while also supporting the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 105.60, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This approach aligns with the need for a sustainable balance as both populations are currently stable.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 85.27, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.61 and a growing wolf population, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing sustainability. This adjustment will help maintain a balance as the sheep population recovers, while also considering the growing wolf population. A gradual approach is essential to avoid over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 38.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity from 0.450 to 0.40, I can allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level (29.4% of maximum capacity), and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we are competing for limited resources. A lower theta allows for a focus on competition among wolves, which can help stabilize our population while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.97, which is only 23.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly."
