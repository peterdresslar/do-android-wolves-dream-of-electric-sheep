            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the competition with other wolves. This adjustment helps maintain a balance, allowing for some sheep depletion without risking a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and sustain themselves. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual increase is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring long-term sustainability for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.72, it is essential to maintain a balance that allows for both sheep recovery and wolf population stability. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help ensure sustainable coexistence while allowing for gradual adjustments as conditions change.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing sheep to recover. Gradual changes are essential to avoid destabilizing the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 29.93, which is only 27.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing our own population. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity and promote a more sustainable balance between wolves and sheep, ensuring long-term survival for both.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.69, which is only 22.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.30, which is only 18.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I need to maintain some hunting to support wolf reproduction, I should not overhunt to allow the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still being mindful of the declining sheep numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.94, which is only 15.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover, and a lower hunting intensity will allow for their population to stabilize. Additionally, with a wolf population of 52, focusing on competition among wolves rather than aggressive hunting will help maintain our numbers while ensuring the sheep can bounce back.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.08, which is only 13.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.53, which is only 12.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to ensure our own survival. A theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting while prioritizing the long-term balance between our populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the wolf population is relatively high. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain our population while allowing the sheep to recover. This adjustment is gradual, aligning with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.77, which is only 10.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to recover while also reducing competition among wolves. By maintaining a moderate approach, I can ensure the long-term survival of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be increased slightly to support wolf reproduction. However, I must be cautious and avoid drastic changes, so a small increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that considers both the immediate needs of the wolf population and the long-term sustainability of the sheep."
