            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 264\n- Sheep population: 12.62\n- Wolf population: 41.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.450\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.31 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 11.5% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that we can afford to increase our hunting intensity slightly without risking a severe depletion of their numbers. A moderate increase to 0.65 allows for sustainable coexistence while still supporting our wolf population's growth.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations while ensuring our pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 96.55, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This value reflects a balanced approach, considering the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need to avoid over-depleting the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for some hunting without risking depletion. However, with the wolf population also present, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term health of both sheep and wolves. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to maintain balance as the sheep population is recovering, while also considering the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sustainable coexistence. A gradual increase aligns with the current trends and maintains balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 41.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.67, I need to ensure that my hunting intensity is moderate to allow for sustainable coexistence. A slight decrease from my previous theta will help balance the needs of both populations while avoiding overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population also being relatively high, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.59, which is only 25.1% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.27, which is only 20.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach while still being mindful of the need to compete with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.38, which is only 16.7% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 will help maintain a balance, allowing for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves to prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.81, which is only 14.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.05, which is only 12.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.62, which is only 11.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By lowering my hunting intensity slightly, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some sustainable hunting. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep."
