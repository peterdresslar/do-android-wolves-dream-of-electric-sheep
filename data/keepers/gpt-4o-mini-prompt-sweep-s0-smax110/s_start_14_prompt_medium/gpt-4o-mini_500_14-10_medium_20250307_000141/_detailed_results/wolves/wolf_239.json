            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. However, I must remain cautious and avoid drastic changes to ensure sustainable coexistence with both sheep and my fellow wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 87.8% of maximum capacity, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 2.15, I can maintain a sustainable coexistence while ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. This slight reduction from my previous theta allows for gradual adjustments in response to the current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity while still ensuring their recovery. This value reflects a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while being mindful of the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term health of both species. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach, as the wolf population is also significant, and I want to avoid over-depleting the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment reflects a balance between ensuring the wolf population remains healthy while allowing sheep to recover slightly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 41.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. Given the current wolf population, a slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow for better coexistence and help maintain a healthy balance between both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.45, which is only 32.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some reproduction among wolves while still giving sheep a chance to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep population too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.59, which is only 25.1% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.27, which is only 20.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for increased hunting intensity without depleting the sheep too quickly. However, since the wolf population is relatively high at 62, I want to avoid over-hunting and allow for some recovery in both populations. A slight increase to 0.45 allows for sustainable hunting while still being cautious.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.38, which is only 16.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring the sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.81, which is only 14.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still being mindful of the need to avoid overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.05, which is only 12.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is an opportunity to hunt, I need to be cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.62, which is only 11.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.82, which is only 10.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for recovery in the sheep population. By setting a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of avoiding sudden changes and promotes long-term sustainability."
