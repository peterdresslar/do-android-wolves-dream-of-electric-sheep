Maintaining a focus on competition with other wolves will help stabilize our population while ensuring that the sheep can rebound in the future.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that we should be cautious with our hunting to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the sustainability of both populations. This approach helps maintain balance without risking a crash in the sheep population.",

By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a healthy balance. This gradual adjustment will help ensure long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that they can sustain a moderate increase in hunting intensity. By gradually increasing theta to 0.40, I can balance the need for hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover and avoid overexploitation.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a sustainable balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without overly depleting the sheep population, ensuring long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 59.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population being nearly equal to the sheep population, it",

A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that supports wolf reproduction while giving sheep a chance to recover.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 29.60, which is only 26.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I need to maintain some hunting to support wolf reproduction, I should not overhunt to allow the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 will help balance the needs of both populations without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.26, which is only 21.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.450 to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, focusing on both hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.58, which is only 16.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.4 to 0.35, I can maintain a focus on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring that both populations can stabilize and thrive in the long term."
