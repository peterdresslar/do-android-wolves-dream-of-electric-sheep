            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 194\n- Sheep population: 12.45\n- Wolf population: 40.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.400\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.31 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 11.3% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. A lower theta allows for competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing sustainability. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term survival for both.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 88% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 45, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will support wolf reproduction without overly depleting the sheep population, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because it represents a balanced approach to hunting and competing. The sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and with the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicating a slight abundance of sheep, a moderate increase in hunting intensity will allow for healthy reproduction among wolves while still giving sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both species. This adjustment reflects a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring that the sheep population can recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level relative to its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A slight decrease from my previous theta will help balance the needs of both populations while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.36, which is only 29.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is some room for hunting, it is essential to prioritize the recovery of the sheep population to ensure long-term sustainability. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, which is necessary given the current wolf population of 70. This approach helps maintain balance without risking a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.97, which is only 23.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need to adapt to the changing conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.75, which is only 18.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is some opportunity for hunting, it is crucial to prioritize the recovery of the sheep population to ensure long-term sustainability. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that supports both hunting and the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.89, which is only 16.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I can increase my hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. A gradual increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.32, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for wolf reproduction with the sustainability of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.67, which is only 12.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for gradual hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of the wolf pack.",
