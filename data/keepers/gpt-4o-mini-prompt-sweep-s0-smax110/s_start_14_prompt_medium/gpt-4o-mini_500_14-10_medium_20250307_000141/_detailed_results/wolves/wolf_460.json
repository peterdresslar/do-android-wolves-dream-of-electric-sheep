            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 59.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population being nearly equal to the sheep population, a moderate approach is necessary to avoid over-depleting the sheep while allowing for some hunting to support wolf reproduction. This adjustment maintains a balance that can adapt to future changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicating a potential strain on resources, a slight reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain both populations sustainably. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of gradual changes to ensure long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and while it is important to maintain a balance, I need to focus on ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still providing enough resources for the wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 29.60, which is only 26.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to stabilize while still competing with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.26, which is only 21.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done gradually to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a more balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.58, which is only 16.9% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",

To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while maintaining a stable wolf population.
