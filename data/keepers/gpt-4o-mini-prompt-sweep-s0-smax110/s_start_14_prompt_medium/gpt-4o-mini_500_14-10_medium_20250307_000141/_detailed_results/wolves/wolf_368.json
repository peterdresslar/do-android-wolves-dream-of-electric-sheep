            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. A lower theta allows for a focus on competition among wolves, which can help maintain our numbers while giving sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment will help ensure long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 93.7% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 41, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 83.2% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 50, I need to be cautious not to overhunt and risk depleting the sheep too quickly. A gradual increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach that supports both wolf reproduction and sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a sustainable balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term survival of both species. This moderate adjustment will help maintain balance as the sheep population recovers and prevents overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for some increased hunting without risking depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing sheep to recover gradually.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while it is beneficial to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must also consider the growing wolf population. A moderate adjustment allows for a balanced approach that supports both species without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.14, which is only 23.8% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A moderate adjustment helps maintain balance and allows for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.66, which is only 18.8% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.35, which is only 15.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I need to maintain some hunting to support wolf reproduction, I should prioritize a more cautious approach to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a slight increase in hunting intensity while still focusing on competition with other wolves, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.77, which is only 13.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still being mindful of the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.08, which is only 11.9% of its maximum capacity. While I want to ensure the wolves can thrive, I need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep population to maintain a sustainable balance. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, which is necessary given the current wolf population of 47. This approach helps prevent over-depletion of the sheep and supports long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.93, which is only 10.8% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A gradual increase helps maintain balance and allows both populations to recover sustainably.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.20, which is only 10.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.400 to 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, promoting a balanced ecosystem."
