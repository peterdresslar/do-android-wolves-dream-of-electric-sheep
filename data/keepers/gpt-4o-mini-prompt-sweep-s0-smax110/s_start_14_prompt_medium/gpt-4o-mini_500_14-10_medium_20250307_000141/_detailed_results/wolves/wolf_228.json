            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution in hunting to avoid depleting their numbers. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 3.79, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and while I want to increase hunting to support wolf reproduction, I must do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is close to its maximum capacity, indicating that they can sustain a bit more hunting without significant depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach to hunting while still considering the growth of the wolf population. This adjustment promotes coexistence and ensures that both populations can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while also considering the growing wolf population. This adjustment promotes sustainable coexistence and avoids depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, but I want to ensure that we do not overhunt them as the wolf population is also significant. A slight decrease in hunting intensity allows for a sustainable balance while still enabling some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment helps ensure the wolf population can thrive while still allowing the sheep to recover and maintain their numbers. A gradual increase is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the wolf population is slightly high. A moderate hunting intensity will allow for some sheep recovery while also keeping the wolf population in check. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance without risking a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 41.6% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring both can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.52, it indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A slight decrease from my previous theta will help balance the competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.59, which is only 25.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.27, which is only 20.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a more balanced approach, focusing on both hunting and competition with other wolves as the wolf population is relatively high at 62. I want to ensure that both populations can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.38, which is only 16.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that supports both wolf reproduction and sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.81, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be increased slightly to ensure our survival and reproduction. However, given the wolf population is relatively high at 51.00, I must be cautious and avoid overhunting, allowing for a gradual adjustment to maintain balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.05, which is only 12.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting without over-depleting the sheep, promoting a sustainable balance."
