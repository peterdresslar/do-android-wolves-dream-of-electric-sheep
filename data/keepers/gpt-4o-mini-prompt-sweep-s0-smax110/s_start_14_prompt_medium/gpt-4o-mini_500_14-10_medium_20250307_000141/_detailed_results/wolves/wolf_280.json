To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition with other wolves. A gradual increase in theta is warranted as the sheep population grows, but for now, a lower value will help maintain balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in sheep numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition with other wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery and prevent depletion. Maintaining a lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep while allowing for gradual adjustments in the future.",

Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover and ensures the long-term survival of both species. It also helps to stabilize the wolf population by avoiding overexploitation of the sheep.",

By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition with other wolves. This gradual adjustment helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover and ensures the long-term survival of both species. This balanced approach is crucial as the wolf population is also relatively stable, and we need to avoid overexploitation.",

Maintaining a lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, as it prevents overhunting while allowing the sheep population to stabilize.",

A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",

This adjustment reflects a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction without risking a significant depletion of the sheep population.",

A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a more cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting. This will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
