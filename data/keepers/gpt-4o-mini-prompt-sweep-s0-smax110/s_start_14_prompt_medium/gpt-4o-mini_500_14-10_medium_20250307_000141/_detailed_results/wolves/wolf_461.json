            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 469\n- Sheep population: 65.75\n- Wolf population: 64.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.631\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 1.03 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 59.8% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.72, a moderate approach will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition among wolves, allowing both populations to thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 37.90, which is only 34.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring that both populations can recover and thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 29.60, which is only 26.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting without risking the depletion of the sheep. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.35 to 0.40, I can help sustain the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover gradually. This moderate approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",

This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A moderate increase from my previous theta of 0.400 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.58, which is only 16.9% of its maximum capacity.

This indicates that we need to allow the sheep to recover while also considering the growing wolf population.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.44, which is only 9.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover.

This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
