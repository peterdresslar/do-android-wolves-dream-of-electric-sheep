            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to prevent depletion. A balanced approach allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling the wolf population to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and while I want to ensure the wolves can reproduce, I also need to allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance between both populations, promoting sustainability without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a slight reduction in hunting intensity to promote sustainability. This adjustment will help maintain a balance between the wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term survival for both. By keeping the theta moderate, I can also account for the gradual increase in wolf numbers without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 83.8% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 48, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain the wolf population while still ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A moderate approach balances our needs with the ecosystem",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and my previous theta of 0.55 was slightly aggressive. A small reduction to 0.50 allows for continued hunting while also giving the sheep a chance to recover, ensuring a balance that supports both populations in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 45.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. Given the current wolf population, a slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that supports both the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 34.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 69, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low relative to the maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to thrive. This gradual adjustment helps maintain a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.74, which is only 21.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.35, which is only 17.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover while still ensuring the wolf population remains stable. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the long-term balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.65, which is only 15.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for gradual hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach while still being cautious about the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.58, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.92, which is only 11.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population without depleting the sheep further."
