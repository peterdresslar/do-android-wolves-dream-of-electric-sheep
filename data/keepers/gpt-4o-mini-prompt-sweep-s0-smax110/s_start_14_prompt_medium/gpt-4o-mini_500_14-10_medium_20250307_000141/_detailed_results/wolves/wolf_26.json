            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and hunting them aggressively could lead to depletion. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition with other wolves. This moderate approach supports long-term sustainability for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition with other wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in sheep numbers, jeopardizing the long-term survival of both species. Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover while we focus on competition among wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that they are abundant. However, the wolf population is also relatively stable, so I need to maintain a cautious approach to ensure that we do not deplete the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and a slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain the balance without depleting the sheep too quickly. This adjustment allows for sustainable coexistence while also supporting the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently healthy at 92.21, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring both populations can thrive together.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 72.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.44, it is essential to maintain a balance to prevent overhunting and ensure the long-term survival of both species. A slight reduction in hunting intensity allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still maintaining a balance that prevents over-depletion of the sheep population. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the trends in both populations, a moderate increase will help ensure long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 45.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 67, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still considering the need for sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low relative to the wolf population, and a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species and maintains a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.74, which is only 21.6% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase in hunting intensity to 0.40 will help sustain my pack while still being mindful of the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.35, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking their long-term survival. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.65, which is only 15.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing our wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competing with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species."
