            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 410\n- Sheep population: 10.74\n- Wolf population: 32.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.350\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.34 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 9.8% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still healthy at 93.7% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help support wolf reproduction while ensuring that the sheep population does not deplete too quickly. A gradual adjustment is key to maintaining balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 83.2% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover if needed. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.60 maintains a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must do so gradually to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach that considers both the current sheep population and the growing wolf numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 41.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with a wolf population of 70, which is relatively high, I need to be cautious about overhunting. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 31.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 71.00, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.14, which is only 23.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight reduction in hunting intensity allows for some recovery of the sheep population while still enabling the wolf population to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.66, which is only 18.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to help sustain our population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without risking the depletion of sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.35, which is only 15.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support our wolf population without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.77, which is only 13.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a more balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.08, which is only 11.9% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, it is crucial to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 will help me focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low at 11.93, which is only 10.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.20, which is only 10.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that the sheep need time to recover, and a lower hunting intensity will help ensure their survival while allowing the wolf population to stabilize. Gradually adjusting to 0.350 allows for a slight increase in hunting without overwhelming the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.74, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a bit more hunting intensity, but still prioritizes balance and sustainability."
