By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in sheep numbers, jeopardizing the long-term survival of both species. Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery and prevent depletion. Maintaining a focus on competition with other wolves will help stabilize our population while ensuring the sheep can bounce back.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at its maximum capacity, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should remain low to allow the sheep to recover. Maintaining a lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both species and prevent overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery. Maintaining a lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, as it prevents overhunting and allows the sheep population to stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at its maximum capacity, and while I need to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that we should be cautious with our hunting intensity. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still enabling the sheep to recover and maintain a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 94.40, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to maintain balance, given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need to avoid over-depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the wolf population is also quite high. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still providing enough food for the wolves. This adjustment supports long-term coexistence and prevents over-exploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 45.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a wolf population of 69, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is low, suggesting that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. This approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both species and prevent overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 37.90, which is only 34.5% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious about depleting the sheep further. A gradual increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for sustainable coexistence as I monitor both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 29.60, which is only 26.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is some room for hunting, I need to be cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the sustainability of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.26, which is only 21.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing competition among wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.58, which is only 16.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach that considers both the immediate need for food and the long-term sustainability of the ecosystem.",
