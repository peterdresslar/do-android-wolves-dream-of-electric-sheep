            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 55\n- Sheep population: 12.92\n- Wolf population: 43.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.400\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.30 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 11.7% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that we can afford to maintain a moderate hunting intensity. This allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling our pack to thrive. A slight increase from my previous theta will help balance the needs of both populations without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still healthy at 93.7% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This balance helps maintain both populations sustainably.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 83.8% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate hunting approach. This will help maintain the balance between wolves and sheep while avoiding overhunting. Gradually adjusting the theta downwards also accounts for the growing wolf population, ensuring we do not deplete our prey too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while it is beneficial to increase hunting intensity slightly, I must remain cautious to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A moderate approach allows for continued coexistence while also considering the growth of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still promoting coexistence. This adjustment reflects the need to balance the growing wolf population and the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 45.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 67, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting, which could lead to a decline in sheep numbers and ultimately harm both populations. A slight decrease in hunting intensity allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still considering the growing wolf population. This adjustment promotes a balance that supports both species without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 29.55, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A slight decrease from my previous theta will help maintain a balance, ensuring that both the sheep and wolf populations can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.74, which is only 21.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it is crucial to maintain a balance to allow the sheep to recover. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will help ensure the long-term survival of both species while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.35, which is only 17.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need to compete with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.65, which is only 15.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.4 to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.58, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I also want to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will enable me to hunt more effectively without depleting the sheep too quickly, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.92, which is only 11.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain my pack"
