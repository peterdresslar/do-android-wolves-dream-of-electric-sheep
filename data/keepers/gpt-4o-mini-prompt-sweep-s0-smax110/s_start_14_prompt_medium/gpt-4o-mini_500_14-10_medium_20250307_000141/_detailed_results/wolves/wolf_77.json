To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition with other wolves. A gradual decrease in hunting will help maintain balance without risking a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. With a high sheep-to-wolf ratio, focusing on competition with other wolves will help stabilize the wolf population while giving sheep a chance to rebound.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be cautiously increased to prevent over-depletion. However, with a relatively low wolf population, I need to ensure that we do not overhunt and allow for sustainable coexistence. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term health of both populations.",

A slight increase from my previous theta will enable some hunting while still prioritizing the balance of the ecosystem.",

By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep to recover while maintaining our numbers. This gradual adjustment will help ensure long-term sustainability for both species.",
