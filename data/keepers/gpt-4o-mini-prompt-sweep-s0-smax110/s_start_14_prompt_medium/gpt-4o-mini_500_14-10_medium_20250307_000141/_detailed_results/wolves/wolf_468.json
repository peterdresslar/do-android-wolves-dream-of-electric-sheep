With the sheep population at 45.3% of its maximum capacity, there is room for moderate hunting without risking depletion. Additionally, the wolf population is relatively high, so maintaining a sustainable balance is crucial to avoid overexploitation of the sheep.",

While I want to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I also recognize the need to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the sustainability of the sheep population.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.26, which is only 21.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I need to maintain some hunting to support the wolf population, I should not overhunt to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 will help balance the needs of both populations without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.58, which is only 16.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover, and a lower hunting intensity will allow for their population to stabilize. Additionally, with a wolf population of 60, it is wise to focus on competition among wolves rather than aggressive hunting, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.04, which is only 14.6% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking the depletion of the sheep population. By raising theta to 0.40, I can balance the need for wolf reproduction with the sustainability of the sheep, ensuring both populations can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the wolf population is relatively high. A moderate approach allows for some hunting while still giving the sheep a chance to recover. This will help maintain balance in the ecosystem and prevent over-depletion of the sheep.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.44, which is only 9.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for sheep recovery. A theta of 0.35 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for some hunting while prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both populations.",

This suggests that there is an opportunity to increase hunting intensity slightly to help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A small increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",

This balance helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
