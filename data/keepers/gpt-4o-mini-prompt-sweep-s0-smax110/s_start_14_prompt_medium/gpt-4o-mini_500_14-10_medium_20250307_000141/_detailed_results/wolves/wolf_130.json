To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity slightly to allow the sheep to recover while still competing with other wolves. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance.",

This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations while also considering the need for gradual changes.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual increase is essential to avoid sudden shifts that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 29.93, which is only 27.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is some room for hunting, it is essential to prioritize the recovery of the sheep population to ensure long-term sustainability. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, which is necessary given the current wolf population of 66. This approach helps maintain balance and avoids depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.69, which is only 22.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A moderate increase in theta to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",

A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the wolf population is relatively high. A moderate hunting intensity allows for some hunting while giving sheep a chance to recover. This approach helps maintain a balance between both populations and avoids over-depletion of sheep.",
