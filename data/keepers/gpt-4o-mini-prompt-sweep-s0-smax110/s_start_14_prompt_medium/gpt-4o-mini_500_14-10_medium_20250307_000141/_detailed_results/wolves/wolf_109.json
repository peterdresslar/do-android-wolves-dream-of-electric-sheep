            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is close to its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. A lower theta allows for competition among wolves, which can help keep our numbers in check while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual approach supports long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 88.5% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term survival for both.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still maintaining a sustainable balance with the sheep population. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need to avoid sudden changes, a gradual increase is prudent.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a sustainable balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without overly depleting the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while it is beneficial to increase hunting intensity as the sheep population grows, I need to be cautious given the current wolf population. A slight decrease in hunting intensity allows for a more balanced approach, helping both populations thrive without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 67.00, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while I want to ensure my pack thrives, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and prevent over-depletion of the sheep, which is crucial for long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level relative to the maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are not enough sheep to sustain a high hunting intensity without risking depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious to avoid overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.69, which is only 22.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.40 strikes a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.30, which is only 18.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.94, which is only 15.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is a need for the sheep to recover, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to bounce back while still enabling the wolf population to compete effectively. Gradually reducing hunting intensity will help maintain a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.08, which is only 13.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring that both populations can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.53, which is only 12.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain our wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for gradual adjustments.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.43, which is only 11.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing our own wolf population. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure, allowing for a more sustainable balance between the two populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.77, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking over-depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population"
