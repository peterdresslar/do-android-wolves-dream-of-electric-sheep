Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.67, I want to focus on maintaining a balance that allows for sustainable coexistence. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help the sheep recover while still allowing for some hunting to support the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.45, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports our wolf population while still considering the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A slight decrease from my previous theta will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can stabilize and grow.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.27, which is only 20.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for more hunting to support wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery. This balance will help maintain a sustainable ecosystem."
