            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and hunting them aggressively could lead to depletion. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep to recover while maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for a focus on competition with other wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover and ensures the long-term survival of both species. It is essential to focus on competition with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that a slight increase in hunting intensity is appropriate to ensure the wolf population can thrive. However, I must be cautious and avoid drastic changes, as the wolf population is still relatively low. A moderate increase allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling us to adapt to future changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 95.3% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 39, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 95.64, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while maintaining a sustainable balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly, as the sheep are still at 86.9% of their maximum capacity. A gradual increase is prudent to avoid sudden population crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight reduction in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term sustainability while still allowing for some hunting to support wolf reproduction.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 51.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.85, it is important to maintain a balance that allows both populations to thrive. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help ensure the sheep can recover while also allowing for some competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery. A gradual increase is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 31.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.51, it is crucial to maintain a balance that allows for the sheep to recover while also ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help sustain both populations without risking a crash.",

This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still being mindful of the need to avoid overhunting.",

This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population.

This suggests that while we need to hunt to sustain our wolf population, we must be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population.",
