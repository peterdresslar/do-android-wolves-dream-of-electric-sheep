Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to recover, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in sheep numbers, jeopardizing the long-term survival of both species. Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover while keeping the wolf population stable.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover and ensures the long-term survival of both species. This balanced approach helps prevent overexploitation while still allowing for competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at maximum capacity, indicating that further intense hunting could lead to depletion and disrupt the balance. Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition with other wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that they can sustain a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. However, given the current wolf population, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to maintain balance and ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 104.06, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 40.00, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still healthy at 94.40, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 72.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with the wolf population at 57.00, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment reflects a balance between ensuring the wolf population thrives while allowing the sheep to recover and maintain their numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 45.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.72, it is essential to maintain a balanced approach to ensure the sheep can recover while also allowing for some hunting to support the wolf population. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a more sustainable coexistence, avoiding overhunting while still addressing the needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring both populations can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 29.60, which is only 26.9% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, allowing for sustainable coexistence while still addressing the needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.26, which is only 21.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that encourages reproduction among wolves while still being mindful of the sheep"
