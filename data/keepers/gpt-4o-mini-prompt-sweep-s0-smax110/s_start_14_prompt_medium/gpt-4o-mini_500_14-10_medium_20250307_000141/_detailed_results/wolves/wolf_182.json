            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 85.27, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. However, I must remain cautious as the wolf population is also significant at 53.00. A theta of 0.76 allows for sustainable hunting while ensuring that both populations can thrive without leading to depletion or competition issues.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the sheep population at 50.7% of its maximum capacity, I can maintain a sustainable hunting intensity while ensuring that the sheep can recover. This adjustment also considers the growing wolf population, which necessitates a slight reduction in hunting to avoid over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 38.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 70, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both species can thrive. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, supporting both the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.36, which is only 29.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack without depleting the sheep further, promoting a more balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.97, which is only 23.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I can increase my hunting intensity slightly, I need to be cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. A small increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still giving sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.75, which is only 18.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta will help balance our needs without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.89, which is only 16.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain our population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.32, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from the previous theta of 0.40 to 0.35, I can still maintain some hunting while prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.67, which is only 12.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased slightly to support wolf reproduction, it is crucial to avoid overhunting to allow the sheep population to recover. A gradual increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for sustainable coexistence while being mindful of the current low sheep numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.45, which is only 11.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By adopting a lower theta, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize and gradually increase. This approach aligns with my objective of ensuring the long-term survival of both species while maintaining a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.72, which is only 10.7% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting. This will help maintain a balance and prevent over-depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.23, which is only 10.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while I need to maintain a focus on hunting to support the wolf population, I should do so cautiously to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 to 0.35 reflects a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the immediate needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.02, which is only 10.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting without risking depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery."
