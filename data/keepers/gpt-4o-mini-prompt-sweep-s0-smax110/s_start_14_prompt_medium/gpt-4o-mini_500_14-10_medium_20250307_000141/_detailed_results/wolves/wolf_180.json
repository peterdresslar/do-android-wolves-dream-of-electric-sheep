            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 88% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This value reflects a balanced approach, considering the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need to avoid overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, but I want to ensure that we do not overhunt and deplete their numbers too quickly. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a more cautious approach, focusing on maintaining balance while still allowing for some hunting to support our wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover gradually.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 50.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.83, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery. A gradual increase is essential to avoid depleting the sheep population too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.36, which is only 29.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring both populations can recover and thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.97, which is only 23.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain our wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.75, which is only 18.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a lower hunting intensity is necessary to allow the sheep to recover. Additionally, with a wolf population of 61, maintaining a focus on competition among wolves will help stabilize our numbers while ensuring the sheep can gradually increase. A small adjustment to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach without risking over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I need to maintain a balance to ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, a slight increase in hunting intensity will help sustain my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.32, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 allows for a more balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the immediate needs of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.67, which is only 12.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack but prioritizes the long-term balance and recovery of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.45, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a balance as the sheep population recovers, while also considering the growing wolf population. A gradual increase is essential to avoid sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.72, which is only 10.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting for the wolves. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, focusing on coexistence and sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.23, which is only 10.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover, and focusing on competition with other wolves will help maintain our population while allowing the sheep to bounce back. A lower theta will help ensure sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.02, which is only 10.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is potential for recovery if we reduce hunting intensity slightly. By increasing theta from 0.30 to 0.35, I can still maintain some hunting to support our wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover and grow, ensuring a sustainable balance."
