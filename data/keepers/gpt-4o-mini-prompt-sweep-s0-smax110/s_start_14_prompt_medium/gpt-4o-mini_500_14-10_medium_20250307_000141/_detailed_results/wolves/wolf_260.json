However, with the wolf population at 68, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both species can thrive. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that supports wolf reproduction while still giving sheep a chance to recover.",

This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still being cautious. A theta of 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, enabling us to hunt more effectively without depleting the sheep too quickly. It also considers the growing wolf population, ensuring we do not overhunt and can sustain both populations in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.38, which is only 16.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased slightly to support wolf reproduction, it is crucial to avoid overhunting to allow the sheep population to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach that balances the need for hunting with the sustainability of the ecosystem.",

A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance and ensure both populations can thrive.",

This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring a sustainable balance.",

This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover rather than intensifying our hunting.

This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly.
