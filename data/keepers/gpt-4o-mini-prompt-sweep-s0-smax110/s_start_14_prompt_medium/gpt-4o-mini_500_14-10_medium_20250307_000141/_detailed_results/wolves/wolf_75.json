            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 34.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A moderate increase in theta allows for some hunting while still considering the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low relative to the maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. A lower theta allows for more competition among wolves, which can help stabilize our numbers while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.74, which is only 21.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for more hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance that supports both wolf and sheep populations. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of adapting to changing conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.35, which is only 17.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 to 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to support our population. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.65, which is only 15.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should be cautious with our hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the sustainability of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.58, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.400 to 0.35, I can maintain a focus on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.92, which is only 11.7% of its maximum capacity. While I need to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of my pack.",
