            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 260\n- Sheep population: 22.27\n- Wolf population: 62.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.350\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.36 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 20.2% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and my previous theta was quite low. To allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a focus on competition with other wolves, a gradual increase is necessary. This will help ensure the long-term survival of both species without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and my previous theta was low. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to gradually increase my hunting intensity while being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A small increase to 0.25 allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves.",

Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover and ensures that our wolf population can thrive in the long term without risking a crash in the ecosystem.",

Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover and ensures that the wolf population remains sustainable in the long term. It is important to focus on competition with other wolves while allowing the sheep to stabilize.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in sheep numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both populations.",

However, with the wolf population also present, I need to maintain a balance to avoid competition issues. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for sustainable hunting while still considering the long-term health of both populations.",

This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring both can thrive in the long term.",

This approach helps maintain a balance between both populations, avoiding overexploitation of the sheep and allowing for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 84.84, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment reflects a balance between maintaining a sustainable sheep population and ensuring the wolf pack can thrive. By gradually increasing theta, I can respond to the current conditions while keeping an eye on long-term stability.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.59, which is only 25.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack without depleting the sheep further, promoting a healthier balance in the ecosystem.",
