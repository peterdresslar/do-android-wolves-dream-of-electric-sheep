            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 407\n- Sheep population: 13.08\n- Wolf population: 47.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.400\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.28 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 11.9% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that we need to be cautious with our hunting to avoid depleting their numbers too quickly. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while also giving sheep a chance to recover, which is essential for the long-term survival of both species. This approach helps maintain a balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling wolves to maintain their numbers. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of avoiding sudden changes and promotes a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively healthy at 103.03, which is close to its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still maintaining a sustainable balance. A gradual adjustment helps avoid depleting the sheep too quickly and allows for a more stable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 91.47, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a sustainable balance. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to capitalize on the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports our wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because it reflects a moderate approach to hunting that allows for sustainable coexistence. The sheep population is currently at 54.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for cautious hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. Additionally, with the wolf population slightly higher than the sheep population, a balanced strategy will help maintain both populations over the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both species. This moderate adjustment helps maintain balance as the wolf population is relatively high, and it allows for gradual adaptation to the ecosystem",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain the wolf population while ensuring the sheep do not become over-depleted. A gradual increase aligns with the current trends and avoids sudden changes that could disrupt the balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.14, which is only 23.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing competition with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.66, which is only 18.8% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.35 helps maintain balance and allows for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.35, which is only 15.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is potential for recovery if I reduce my hunting intensity slightly. By adopting a moderate approach, I can allow the sheep population to stabilize while still ensuring that my wolf pack remains healthy. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the wolf population is relatively high. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help sustain our population while allowing the sheep to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.08, which is only 11.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting to maintain our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 reflects a moderate balance, allowing for sustainable coexistence without depleting the sheep further."
