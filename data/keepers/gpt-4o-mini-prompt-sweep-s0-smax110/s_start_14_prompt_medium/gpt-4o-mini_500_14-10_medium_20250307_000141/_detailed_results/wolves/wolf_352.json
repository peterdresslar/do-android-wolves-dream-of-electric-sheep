            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A gradual increase in theta is necessary to prevent overhunting while still competing with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves, which will help stabilize the wolf population while preventing overhunting of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a high availability of prey. However, to ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover and prevent overexploitation. A gradual decrease in hunting will help maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. With the wolf population also present, a slight increase in theta will help maintain balance while avoiding over-depletion of sheep. This approach supports sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers, jeopardizing the long-term survival of both species. Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and a slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance without depleting their numbers too quickly. This adjustment allows for sustainable coexistence while still considering the current wolf population and the need for gradual changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 93.7% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 41, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still healthy at 91.47, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 50.00, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 70.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.34, it is essential to maintain a balance to avoid over-depleting the sheep. A moderate increase to 0.55 allows for sustainable hunting while still considering the growth of the wolf population and the need for coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, and while it is beneficial to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must also consider the growing wolf population. A theta of 0.45 allows for a balanced approach that promotes coexistence while avoiding overhunting, ensuring the sheep can recover and the wolves can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and while it is important to maintain a healthy wolf population, I need to allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help ensure that both populations can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 31.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 71.00, I need to be cautious and avoid over-hunting to maintain our numbers. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.14, which is only 23.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting for the wolves",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.66, which is only 18.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to allow for recovery. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting while still prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both the sheep and wolf populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be increased slightly to support wolf reproduction while still allowing for sheep recovery. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep population too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.77, which is only 13.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that the sheep need some time to recover. By setting a theta of 0.35, I can focus more on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a balance between our populations and prevent overhunting."
