            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 409\n- Sheep population: 11.20\n- Wolf population: 37.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.300\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.30 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 10.2% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 93.7% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight reduction in hunting intensity while still benefiting from reproduction. This adjustment helps maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 91.47, allowing for some hunting without risking depletion. However, given that the wolf population is also significant at 50.00, I want to avoid over-hunting and ensure sustainable coexistence. A slight reduction from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach while still supporting wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that can support wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This balance helps maintain the ecosystem without depleting the sheep too quickly, allowing for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain the balance between wolf and sheep populations while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep. A gradual approach will also help us adapt to future changes in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 41.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 70, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both species can thrive. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.14, which is only 23.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity and promote a more sustainable balance, allowing both populations to thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.66, which is only 18.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the immediate needs of the pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.35, which is only 15.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.77, which is only 13.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is potential for growth in the sheep population if I reduce hunting intensity slightly. By increasing theta to 0.40, I can still maintain some hunting to support the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover and grow, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.08, which is only 11.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize while also ensuring that our wolf pack does not overhunt and faces a decline in food sources.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.93, which is only 10.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. With a wolf population of 41.00, maintaining a lower theta will help ensure that we do not deplete the sheep further while also allowing for some competition among wolves. A gradual approach is essential to maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.20, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low at 0.30. This indicates that while I need to be cautious about overhunting, I can afford to increase my hunting intensity slightly to support the wolf population"
