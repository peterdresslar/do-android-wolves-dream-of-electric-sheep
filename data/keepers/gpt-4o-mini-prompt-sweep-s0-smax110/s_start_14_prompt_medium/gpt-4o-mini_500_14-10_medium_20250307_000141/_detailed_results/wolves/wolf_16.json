Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover and prevents overexploitation, ensuring long-term survival for both species. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of adapting to current conditions without causing sudden shifts.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable.

A gradual decrease in hunting will help maintain a sustainable balance.",

Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover while also keeping the wolf population stable. This approach supports long-term coexistence and prevents potential crashes in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating a need for cautious hunting to prevent depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring a balanced approach that supports both populations.",

However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.44, it is essential to maintain a balance to ensure the wolf population does not grow too rapidly. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves.",

This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 45.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. Given the current wolf population, a slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and allow both populations to thrive. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of making gradual changes in response to population trends.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the wolf population is relatively high. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain their numbers. This moderate approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and helps ensure long-term balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be increased slightly to support wolf reproduction while still allowing for some recovery of the sheep population. This small adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.74, which is only 21.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I can increase my hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. A moderate increase to 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, ensuring that both populations can sustain themselves."
