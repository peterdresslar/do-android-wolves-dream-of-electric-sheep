            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and a moderate hunting intensity will allow for sustainable coexistence while still enabling the wolf population to thrive. This adjustment reflects a balance between hunting and competing with other wolves, ensuring we do not deplete the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently healthy at 92.21, which allows for a moderate hunting intensity. This level helps maintain a balance between ensuring the wolf population can thrive while allowing the sheep to recover and sustain their numbers. It reflects a cautious approach, considering the current dynamics and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 72.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 55.00, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both populations can thrive. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while it is beneficial to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must also consider the potential for overhunting. A moderate adjustment allows for a balance that supports both populations without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover and maintain balance. A gradual increase is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 34.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.55, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 29.55, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without depleting their numbers too quickly. This moderate adjustment helps maintain a balance between ensuring wolf reproduction and allowing the sheep population to recover. It reflects a cautious approach to avoid sudden changes while still responding to the current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.74, which is only 21.6% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, allowing for sustainable coexistence while still addressing the needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.35, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking over-depletion. This moderate adjustment will help sustain both the wolf and sheep populations while allowing for some growth in my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.65, which is only 15.1% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.58, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. A moderate theta will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.01, which is only 10.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By increasing my theta slightly from 0.35 to 0.40, I can maintain a balance between hunting and allowing the sheep population to stabilize, while also considering the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.29, which is only 10.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.4 to 0.35, I can still maintain some hunting activity while prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep."
