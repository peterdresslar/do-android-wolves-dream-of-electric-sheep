            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 480\n- Sheep population: 10.44\n- Wolf population: 30.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.400\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.35 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 9.5% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 94.40, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 48.00, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 80.21, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This slight decrease from my previous theta reflects a cautious approach to avoid over-depleting the sheep, especially as the wolf population is also significant. Maintaining a balance is crucial for long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but still below maximum capacity. A moderate hunting intensity will allow for some reproduction among wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining balance and adapting to the current conditions without risking a sudden decline in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 45.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to prevent a crash in the sheep population. A slight decrease in hunting intensity allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still ensuring the wolves can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still ensuring their recovery. This adjustment reflects the need to balance the growing wolf population with the available sheep, promoting coexistence without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 29.60, which is only 26.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.26, which is only 21.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need to compete with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.58, which is only 16.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring a sustainable balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.04, which is only 14.6% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, a slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted to take advantage of the current sheep numbers without depleting them too quickly. This adjustment allows for a more balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.87, which is only 12.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing our need for sustenance with the necessity of allowing the sheep to rebound.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.63, which is only 11.5% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach to hunting while still prioritizing the sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we are competing for limited resources. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach helps maintain a balance between our needs and the sustainability of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.97, which is only 10.0% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep too quickly. A moderate increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.44, which is only 9.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 maintains a moderate approach, balancing the need for wolf survival while giving sheep a chance to increase their numbers."
