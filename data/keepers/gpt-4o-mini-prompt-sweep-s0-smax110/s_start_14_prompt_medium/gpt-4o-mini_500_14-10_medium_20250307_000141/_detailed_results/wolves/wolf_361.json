            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at its maximum capacity, indicating that we need to be cautious about overhunting. A moderate hunting intensity will allow for some reproduction among wolves while giving the sheep a chance to recover, maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A moderate approach will help maintain the balance between wolf and sheep populations while avoiding depletion of the sheep resource.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and a more cautious approach is needed to allow for recovery. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep while still maintaining a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 93.7% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 41, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 83.2% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance. This adjustment will help maintain the wolf population without over-depleting the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still maintaining a healthy sheep population. A gradual increase is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring long-term balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 54.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population slightly higher than the sheep population, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain the balance between the wolf and sheep populations while ensuring our long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 31.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 71, I need to be cautious about over-hunting. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.14, which is only 23.8% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A moderate increase to 0.45 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for sustainable coexistence as we monitor both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.66, which is only 18.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing more on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.35 and only 15.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I need to be cautious about overhunting, a slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted to support wolf reproduction. A theta of 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some growth in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.77, which is only 13.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing our need for sustenance with the long-term health of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.08, which is only 11.9% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain balance and avoid sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem."
