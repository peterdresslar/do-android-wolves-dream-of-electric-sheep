This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",

A moderate approach allows for some hunting while giving sheep a chance to recover and ensuring the long-term survival of both species. This small adjustment also helps maintain a balance as the wolf population is relatively stable.",

A slight increase to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach that considers both the current high sheep population and the need to maintain a sustainable ecosystem.",

This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover if needed. A gradual increase aligns with the wisdom of adapting to current conditions and trends.",

This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to capitalize on the sheep population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 50.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. However, the wolf population is also relatively high, so I need to be cautious about overhunting. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain a healthy population.",

This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight decrease in theta allows for a focus on competition among wolves while still enabling some hunting, promoting a balanced approach that supports both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.97, which is only 23.6% of its maximum capacity.

A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach while still being mindful of the need to avoid overhunting.",
