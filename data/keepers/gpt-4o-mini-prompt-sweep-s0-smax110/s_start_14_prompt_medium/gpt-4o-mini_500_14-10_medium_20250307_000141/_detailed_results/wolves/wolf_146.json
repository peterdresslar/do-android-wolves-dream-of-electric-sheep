This adjustment allows for sustainable coexistence while also supporting the wolf population",

By slightly reducing my hunting intensity from the previous theta, I can help maintain the balance as the wolf population grows and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",

However, with the wolf population at 67, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure our long-term survival. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of the pack.",

With a wolf population of 70, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is low, suggesting that we should focus on competition among wolves rather than intense hunting. A gradual decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while maintaining our population balance.",

This suggests that while I need to maintain some hunting to support the wolf population, I should do so cautiously to allow the sheep to recover.

This indicates that a more conservative approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from the previous theta of 0.450 to 0.35, I can still maintain some hunting activity while prioritizing the long-term balance between both populations.
