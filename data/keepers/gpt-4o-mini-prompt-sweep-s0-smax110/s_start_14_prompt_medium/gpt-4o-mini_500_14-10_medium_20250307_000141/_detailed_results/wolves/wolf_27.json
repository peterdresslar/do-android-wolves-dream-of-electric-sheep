            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 40\n- Sheep population: 110.00\n- Wolf population: 22.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.399\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 5.00 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 100.0% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to depletion. A moderate approach allows for some hunting while giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover and prevent overexploitation. This will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderate to allow for recovery while still competing with other wolves. A slight increase from my previous theta reflects the need to adapt to the current conditions without risking a rapid decline in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that we can afford to increase our hunting intensity slightly. However, given the current wolf population and the need to avoid over-depleting the sheep, a moderate increase allows for sustainable coexistence while still focusing on our own population health.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while ensuring that we do not deplete their numbers too quickly. This adjustment supports our wolf population growth while maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, but with the wolf population also being significant, a slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow for better coexistence. This adjustment will help ensure that both populations can thrive without depleting resources too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, but the wolf population is also quite high. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to thrive. This moderate approach helps maintain balance and prevents overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still ensuring their recovery. This adjustment reflects a balance between competing with other wolves and maintaining a healthy sheep population, promoting coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 34.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.55, it is important to maintain a balanced approach to ensure the long-term survival of both species. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while still enabling the wolf population to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low relative to the maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain a healthy population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.74, which is only 21.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.35, which is only 17.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring a balanced approach that promotes long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.65, which is only 15.1% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, a slight increase in hunting intensity will help balance the needs of both species. This adjustment allows for sustainable coexistence while being mindful of the current low sheep population."
