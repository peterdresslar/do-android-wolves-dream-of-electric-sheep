            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and my previous theta was already at a balanced level. A slight decrease allows for a more cautious approach to hunting, ensuring that both sheep and wolves can thrive without risking depletion or overcompetition.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. With a high sheep-to-wolf ratio and a growing wolf population, it is prudent to focus on competition among wolves rather than aggressive hunting, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery. Maintaining a lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, preventing overhunting and promoting a sustainable ecosystem.",
