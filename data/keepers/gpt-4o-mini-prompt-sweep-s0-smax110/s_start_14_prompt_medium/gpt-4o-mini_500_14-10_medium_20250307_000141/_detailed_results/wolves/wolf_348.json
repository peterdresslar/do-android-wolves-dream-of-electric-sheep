            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to prevent depletion. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring both wolf and sheep populations can sustain themselves over time. This adjustment also considers the current wolf population, which is relatively stable.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and hunting them more aggressively could lead to depletion. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a sustainable wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery. Maintaining a lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in sheep numbers, jeopardizing long-term sustainability. Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover.",

Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover and prevent overexploitation, which is crucial for long-term sustainability. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem.",

Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",

This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, promoting sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 83.2% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate hunting approach. This will help sustain both the sheep and wolf populations while avoiding overexploitation. A slight reduction from my previous theta reflects the need to balance competition among wolves and the ongoing recovery of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a sustainable balance. This adjustment will help support the wolf population without risking a significant depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the wolf population is slightly high. A moderate decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still providing enough food for the wolves. This adjustment aligns with the need for balance and avoids over-depleting the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 41.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 70, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both populations can thrive. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that supports reproduction while preventing depletion of the sheep.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.14, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring both can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.66, which is only 18.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.35, which is only 15.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly."
