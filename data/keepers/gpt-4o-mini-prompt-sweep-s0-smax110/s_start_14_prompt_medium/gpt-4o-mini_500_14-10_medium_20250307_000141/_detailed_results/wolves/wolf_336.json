            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 44.65, which is only 40.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is some room for hunting, I need to be cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate increase to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting to support the wolf population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
