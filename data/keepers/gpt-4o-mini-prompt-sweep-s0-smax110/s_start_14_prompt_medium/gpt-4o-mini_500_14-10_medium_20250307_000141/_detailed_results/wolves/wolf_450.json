            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly. It reflects a moderate approach that considers both the current state of the ecosystem and the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that can support both the wolf and sheep populations. This balance helps ensure that we do not deplete the sheep too quickly while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our numbers. A gradual approach is essential to adapt to the current conditions without causing drastic changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 45.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for gradual hunting without risking depletion. However, with the wolf population at 69, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level relative to its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity slightly to allow the sheep to recover while still competing with other wolves. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 29.60, which is only 26.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is some room for sustainable hunting, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.26, which is only 21.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for moderate hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A theta of 0.45 allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance with the wolf population, which is currently at 65. This approach supports sustainable coexistence and avoids sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.58, which is only 16.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring that both populations can stabilize and thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.04, which is only 14.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting without risking depletion. Increasing theta slightly from 0.35 to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach to hunting while still considering the need for sustainable coexistence as the sheep population recovers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.87, which is only 12.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for sustenance with the long-term health of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.63, which is only 11.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I need to be cautious about overhunting, a slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted to ensure my pack can sustain itself. By adjusting theta to 0.40, I can promote some reproduction in my pack while still allowing the sheep population to recover gradually.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.52, which is only 10.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for sustenance with the long-term health of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.97, which is only 10.0% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A gradual increase helps maintain balance and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.44, which is only 9.5% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also considering the growing wolf population. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance and prevent depletion of the sheep, while still allowing for some hunting to support our pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.27, which is only 9.3% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and avoid depleting their numbers further, I will focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensifying hunting. This will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem and ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
