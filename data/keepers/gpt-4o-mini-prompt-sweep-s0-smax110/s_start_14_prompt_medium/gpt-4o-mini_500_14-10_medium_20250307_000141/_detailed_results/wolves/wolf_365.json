            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 408\n- Sheep population: 11.93\n- Wolf population: 41.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.400\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.29 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 10.8% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that a slight reduction in hunting intensity is prudent to allow for recovery. This adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance between wolves and sheep, ensuring long-term survival for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the sheep population at 93.7% of its maximum capacity, a moderate theta will help sustain both sheep and wolf populations while avoiding overhunting. This adjustment allows for gradual changes in response to the current dynamics without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 83.2% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity. This will help maintain the balance between wolf and sheep populations while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep. A gradual adjustment is necessary as the wolf population is stable, and I want to ensure sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 70.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for increased hunting without risking depletion. However, with a wolf population of 58, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the sheep-to-wolf ratio being close to 1, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 41.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 70, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting, which could lead to a decline in sheep numbers. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, focusing on coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 31.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 71, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.14, which is only 23.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I can increase my hunting intensity slightly, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A small increase to 0.40 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.66, which is only 18.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.35, which is only 15.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need to adapt to the current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.77, which is only 13.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing our own population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep further, as the wolf population is already relatively high.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.08, which is only 11.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach to hunting while still being cautious about the wolf population, which is currently at 47. By making a gradual adjustment, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.93, which is only 10.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should prioritize allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing our need for sustenance with the necessity of ensuring the sheep can rebound."
