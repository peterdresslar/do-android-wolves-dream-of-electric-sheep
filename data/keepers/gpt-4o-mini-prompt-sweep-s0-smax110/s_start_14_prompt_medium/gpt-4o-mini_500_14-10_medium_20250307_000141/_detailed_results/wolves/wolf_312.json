            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a cautious approach to hunting. With the current sheep-to-wolf ratio indicating a healthy number of sheep per wolf, I want to focus on reducing competition among wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover. This gradual adjustment will help maintain balance and ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 75.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with a wolf population of 54, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both populations can thrive. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring both can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 68, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.65, which is only 31.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.23, which is only 24.8% of its maximum capacity. While I want to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I also need to allow the sheep to recover. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance and prevent over-depletion of the sheep, while still allowing for some hunting to support our pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.60, which is only 19.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to allow for sheep recovery while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.91, which is only 16.3% of its maximum capacity. While I want to ensure the wolves can thrive, I also need to allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, allowing both populations to stabilize without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.50, which is only 14.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done gradually to avoid depleting the sheep further. A theta of 0.45 allows for a slight increase in hunting while still considering the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.55, which is only 12.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to allow the sheep to recover while also considering the growing wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack without depleting the sheep further, promoting a more balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.45, which is only 11.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.61, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting strategy to ensure our own survival. A slight decrease from my previous theta will help balance our needs with the sustainability of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.05, which is only 10% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is an opportunity to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A gradual increase to 0.40 strikes a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep can sustain their numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.88, which is only 9.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a lower hunting intensity is necessary to allow the sheep to recover. Additionally, with a wolf population of 28.00, it is prudent to focus on competition among wolves rather than aggressive hunting, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem."
