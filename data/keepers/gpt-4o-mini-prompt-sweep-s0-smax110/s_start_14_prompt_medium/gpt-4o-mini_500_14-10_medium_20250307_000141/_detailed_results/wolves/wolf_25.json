            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 39\n- Sheep population: 110.00\n- Wolf population: 19.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.328\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 5.79 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 100.0% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. A lower theta will help maintain balance without risking a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at its maximum capacity, indicating that we should be cautious with our hunting to avoid depleting their numbers too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the sustainability of both populations. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help maintain a balance that supports both populations in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in sheep numbers, jeopardizing the long-term survival of both species. Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition with other wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that a slight increase in hunting intensity is appropriate to ensure our survival and reproduction. However, I must remain cautious and avoid drastic changes, as the wolf population is still relatively low. A moderate increase allows for sustainable coexistence while still addressing the needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still healthy at 93.7% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover if needed. A moderate approach balances our needs without risking a depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently healthy at 92.21, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 48.00, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 72.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.44, it is wise to maintain a moderate hunting intensity to ensure the sustainability of both populations. A slight reduction from my previous theta allows for a focus on competition with other wolves while still enabling some hunting, promoting a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery. A gradual increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, avoiding sudden changes that could disrupt the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while there is room to increase hunting intensity, it is important to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight reduction in hunting intensity allows for a more balanced approach, ensuring both the wolf and sheep populations can thrive together.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This will help support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level relative to the maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting, ensuring a balance that supports both populations over time.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.74, which is only 21.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.35, which is only 17.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.65, which is only 15.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, allowing for some hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of both populations. It also considers the current wolf population, which is relatively high, suggesting that a slight reduction in hunting intensity is wise to prevent overexploitation of the sheep."
