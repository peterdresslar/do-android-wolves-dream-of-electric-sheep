However, with the wolf population at 71, it is wise to avoid overexploitation of the sheep. A moderate increase in hunting intensity allows for a balance that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.14, which is only 23.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still giving sheep a chance to recover.",

This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain its health. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus on competition with other wolves while allowing for some hunting, ensuring a sustainable balance.",

A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to overhunt.",

This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate increase to 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population, ensuring a sustainable balance.",

A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach to hunting while still considering the need for sheep recovery. This adjustment aims to support both the wolf population and the sustainability of the ecosystem.",

This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support our wolf population without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",

To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting.",

This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover.
