            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and my previous theta was very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while still competing with other wolves. A gradual increase in theta will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. A gradual increase from my previous theta will help balance the competition with other wolves while still considering the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and my previous theta was quite low. A slight increase to 0.25 allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance without risking a sudden decline in sheep numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to depletion. A moderate approach allows for some hunting while giving the sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that we should be cautious with our hunting to prevent depleting their numbers too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a bit more hunting to support our wolf population while still prioritizing the sustainability of the ecosystem.",

A small increase to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach that supports both populations without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, I must remain cautious and avoid overhunting, as the wolf population is still relatively low. A gradual increase will help maintain balance while ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",

This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still maintaining a sustainable balance with the sheep population. It",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 78.7% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep. This moderate adjustment helps to ensure that both populations can thrive without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual increase is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",

This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still maintaining a healthy sheep population. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need for balance, a theta of 0.55 promotes coexistence and prevents overexploitation.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from the previous theta, I can still maintain some reproductive benefits for the wolf population while prioritizing the sustainability of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.69, which is only 22.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is room for some hunting to support wolf reproduction, I need to be cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. A moderate increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.30, which is only 18.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting without risking depletion.
