            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain the balance between wolf and sheep populations while avoiding overexploitation. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need for gradual changes, this moderate increase will support both the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.36, which is only 29.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is some opportunity for hunting, it is crucial to prioritize the recovery of the sheep population to ensure long-term sustainability. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain its health.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.97, which is only 23.6% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking immediate depletion. A gradual increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, enabling sustainable coexistence while still allowing for some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.75, which is only 18.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is some opportunity for hunting, it is crucial to prioritize the recovery of the sheep population to ensure long-term sustainability. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, promoting a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I need to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.32, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain its health. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from the previous theta of 0.4 to 0.35, I can balance the need for sustenance with the goal of ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.67, which is only 12.4% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will enable me to hunt more effectively while still prioritizing the sustainability of both populations. This moderate adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.45, which is only 11.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity.
