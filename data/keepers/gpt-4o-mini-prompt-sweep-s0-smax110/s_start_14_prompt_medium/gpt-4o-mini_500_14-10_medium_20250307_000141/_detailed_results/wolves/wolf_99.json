            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that we should be cautious with our hunting to avoid depleting their numbers too quickly. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring that we can sustain both our wolf population and the sheep in the long term while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and while I want to ensure the wolves can reproduce, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, preventing over-depletion of the sheep while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment helps maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring both can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and I want to ensure a sustainable balance while allowing for some hunting. This moderate adjustment will help maintain the sheep population while also considering the growth of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a sustainable balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep. This moderate adjustment will help maintain our wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.72, it is important to maintain a balanced approach to ensure the sheep can recover while also allowing the wolf population to thrive. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help stabilize both populations and promote long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery. A gradual increase is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we are competing for limited resources. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our wolf population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.69, which is only 22.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I can increase my hunting intensity slightly, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A theta of 0.40 allows for a moderate increase in hunting while still considering the need for sheep recovery and maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.30, which is only 18.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 allows for more hunting while still maintaining a balance that supports the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.94, which is only 15.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population. This balance helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.08, which is only 13.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.53, which is only 12.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a lower hunting intensity is necessary to allow the sheep to recover. Additionally, with a wolf population of 42, focusing on competition among wolves rather than aggressive hunting will help maintain our numbers while ensuring the sheep can gradually increase. A small adjustment to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence."
