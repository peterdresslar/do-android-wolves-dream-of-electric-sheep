            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for continued hunting without risking depletion. However, since the wolf population is also growing, a slight reduction in hunting intensity is warranted to ensure we maintain a sustainable balance and avoid overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 95.64, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 46.00, I need to be cautious not to overhunt and risk depleting the sheep too quickly. A theta of 0.70 strikes a balance between ensuring wolf reproduction and maintaining the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 75.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with the wolf population at 54, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while preventing over-depletion of the sheep. This balance will help maintain both populations in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but with the wolf population also being relatively high, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.65, which is only 31.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A moderate increase to 0.45 maintains a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.23, which is only 24.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I can still hunt, I should focus on a more balanced approach to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.40 allows for some hunting while also considering the need to compete with other wolves, ensuring long-term sustainability for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.60, which is only 19.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for more hunting intensity while still being cautious, as the wolf population is relatively high at 61.00. This adjustment aims to balance the needs of both populations and promote coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.91, which is only 16.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population and maintaining a balance with the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.50, which is only 14.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain our wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of the wolf pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.55, which is only 12.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a lower hunting intensity is necessary to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.400 to 0.35, I can focus on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.45, which is only 11.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting without risking depletion. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.35 to 0.40, I can help ensure the wolf population remains healthy while still allowing the sheep population to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.61, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity.
