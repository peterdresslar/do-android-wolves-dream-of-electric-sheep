This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid over-depletion of the sheep and to adapt to the current dynamics of the ecosystem.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level (29.4% of maximum capacity), and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are fewer sheep available per wolf. This suggests a need for a more balanced approach to ensure the sheep can recover while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our wolf population. A theta of 0.45 allows for moderate hunting intensity, which can help sustain both populations without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.97, which is only 23.6% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.75, which is only 18.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be slightly increased to support wolf reproduction, it is crucial to avoid overhunting to allow the sheep population to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 strikes a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sustainability of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.89, which is only 16.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some reproduction among wolves while still giving sheep a chance to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting sustainability without risking a rapid decline in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.32, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.4 to 0.35, I can still maintain some hunting activity while prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of avoiding sudden changes and responding to population trends.",
