            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 77.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep. However, my previous theta of 0.129 suggests that I have been focusing too much on competition with other wolves. By increasing my theta to 0.25, I can gradually shift towards a more balanced approach that allows for some hunting while still considering the need to maintain the sheep population. This small adjustment will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 64.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.16, I need to be cautious not to overhunt. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on maintaining a balance with the wolf population.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This will help support wolf reproduction while still ensuring that the sheep population can recover. A gradual adjustment is key to maintaining balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.36, which is only 29.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack while not overexploiting the sheep, promoting a healthier ecosystem balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.97, which is only 23.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",

This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack without depleting the sheep further, promoting a balanced ecosystem.",

This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting sustainability without risking a drastic decline in sheep numbers.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.92, which is only 9.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.11, which is only 10.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more conservative approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting to sustain the wolf population.
