            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 77.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.61, it is essential to maintain a balance to avoid over-depletion of the sheep population. A theta of 0.75 allows for increased hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being mindful of the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is necessary to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. While the sheep population is recovering, I want to ensure that my pack remains healthy without depleting their numbers too quickly. A slight reduction from my previous theta will help maintain sustainability while still allowing for some hunting.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.36, which is only 29.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to allow for recovery. A theta of 0.35 reflects a moderate approach, allowing for some hunting while prioritizing the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.97, which is only 23.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain my pack",

To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on a more balanced approach that allows the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to thrive. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 reflects a cautious strategy that prioritizes sustainability over immediate hunting intensity.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.89, which is only 16.3% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.32, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting approach to support our wolf population. A slight decrease from my previous theta of 0.4 will help balance the needs of both populations without risking a crash.",

This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting without risking depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach to hunting while still considering the need for sustainable coexistence with the sheep and managing the wolf population.",

While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the competition with other wolves, ensuring sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I need to maintain a balance, a slight increase in hunting intensity will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. This adjustment allows for a gradual response to the current conditions while still considering the long-term sustainability of both populations.",

This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance and prevent over-depletion of sheep, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
