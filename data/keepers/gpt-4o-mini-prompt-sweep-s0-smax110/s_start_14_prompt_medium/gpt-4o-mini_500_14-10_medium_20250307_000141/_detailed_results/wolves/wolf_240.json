            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 95.9% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. However, since the wolf population is also growing, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure long-term sustainability. A theta of 0.72 strikes a balance between hunting and allowing sheep to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 96.55, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while ensuring that the sheep population does not decline too rapidly. A theta of 0.65 strikes a balance between competing with other wolves and maintaining a sustainable sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 77.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.60, it is wise to maintain a balanced approach to avoid depleting the sheep population too quickly. A theta of 0.60 allows for continued hunting while also considering the need for sustainable coexistence as the wolf population grows.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly, ensuring long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, and while it is beneficial to increase hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must also consider the growing wolf population. A theta of 0.45 allows for a balanced approach that promotes coexistence while still enabling some hunting to sustain our pack. This gradual adjustment will help avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 41.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.67, it is essential to maintain a balance that allows for the sheep to recover while also ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help sustain both populations without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and while I need to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.59, which is only 25.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight reduction in hunting intensity allows for a more sustainable coexistence and gives the sheep a chance to recover while still ensuring the wolf population remains healthy.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.27, which is only 20.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for increased hunting intensity without risking immediate depletion. However, with the wolf population at 62.00, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight increase to 0.45 allows for sustainable hunting while still considering the need for balance with my fellow wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.38, which is only 16.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack without over-depleting the sheep, promoting a healthier ecosystem in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.81, which is only 14.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.05, which is only 12.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for gradual adjustments.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.62, which is only 11.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus more on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This gradual adjustment helps maintain a balance between hunting and the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.82, which is only 10.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need to adapt to the changing conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.20, which is only 10.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for some hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of both populations."
