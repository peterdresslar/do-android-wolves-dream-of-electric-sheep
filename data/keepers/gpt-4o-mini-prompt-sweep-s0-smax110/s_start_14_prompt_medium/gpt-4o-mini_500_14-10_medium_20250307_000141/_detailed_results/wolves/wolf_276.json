A lower theta will help reduce pressure on the sheep while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring a sustainable balance as the wolf population grows.",

With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 13.75, it is crucial to focus on competition among wolves rather than depleting the sheep further. This approach will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",

However, with the wolf population also present, I need to be cautious and avoid over-hunting. A slight increase in theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition among wolves to maintain a balanced ecosystem.",
