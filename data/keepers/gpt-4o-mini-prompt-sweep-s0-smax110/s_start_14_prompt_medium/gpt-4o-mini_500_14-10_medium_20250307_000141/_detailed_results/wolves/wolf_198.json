However, given the current wolf population of 67, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to maintain a sustainable balance. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for increased hunting while still considering the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for some increased hunting intensity without risking depletion. Given that the sheep population is recovering and the wolf population is relatively high, a moderate increase in hunting will help maintain our numbers while still allowing sheep to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 29.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 70, which is relatively high, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A moderate theta of 0.60 allows for continued hunting while also considering the need to maintain a balance as the wolf population grows.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.97, which is only 23.6% of its maximum capacity. While I want to ensure the survival of both wolves and sheep, a moderate hunting intensity will allow for some reproduction among wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover. This balance is crucial for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.75, which is only 18.9% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.40 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.89, which is only 16.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting to sustain the wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep further.",

While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I also want to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will enable me to hunt more effectively while still being cautious about depleting the sheep further. This balanced approach supports sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.67, which is only 12.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring a balance that supports both populations.",

This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.72, which is only 10.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover while still ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 to 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.23, which is only 10.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain a balance and prevent overhunting, ensuring sustainable cycles.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.02, which is only 10.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.30 to 0.35, I can still maintain a focus on competition with other wolves while allowing for some hunting. This approach promotes a gradual balance, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.92, which is only 9.9% of its maximum capacity. While I want to ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, a slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted to allow for some reproduction among wolves without depleting the sheep population too quickly. This moderate adjustment helps maintain a balance as we navigate the current ecosystem state.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.98, which is only 10.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while maintaining a moderate hunting intensity.

To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. This will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.46, which is only 10.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is some opportunity for hunting, it is crucial to avoid overexploitation. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a more balanced approach, enabling the sheep to recover while still supporting the wolf population",
