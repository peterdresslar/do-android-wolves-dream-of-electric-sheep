To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I will maintain a low hunting intensity while focusing on competition with other wolves. This will help prevent over-depletion of the sheep population and allow for a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and my previous low theta indicates a focus on competition with other wolves. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I will make a small adjustment to increase hunting intensity while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This gradual approach allows for a sustainable balance.",

With the sheep-to-wolf ratio being 1.34, it indicates that while there are enough sheep for hunting, we must also be cautious not to deplete their numbers too quickly. A slight reduction from my previous theta allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling reproduction among the wolves.",

However, with the wolf population at 70, I need to be cautious about over-hunting. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to thrive.",

This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover rather than intensifying hunting. A moderate theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can stabilize and grow, promoting long-term sustainability."
