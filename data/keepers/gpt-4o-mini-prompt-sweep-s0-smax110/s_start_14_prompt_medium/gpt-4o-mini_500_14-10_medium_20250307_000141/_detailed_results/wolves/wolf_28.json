            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that we should not increase hunting intensity further. A moderate approach allows for some hunting while giving sheep a chance to recover, which is essential for long-term balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution in hunting. By lowering my hunting intensity slightly, I can allow the sheep to recover while still competing with other wolves. This approach helps maintain a balance that supports both populations in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain balance and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that we can afford to increase our hunting intensity slightly without risking depletion. However, given the current wolf population, I want to ensure that we don",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 93.7% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 39, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 92.21, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a sustainable balance. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, as well as adapting to the current population dynamics.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 72.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with the wolf population at 55.00, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction without significantly depleting the sheep population, ensuring long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for some hunting without risking depletion. Given the wolf population is relatively high, a slight reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and allow for sheep recovery while still supporting wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment reflects a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while ensuring that the sheep can recover and maintain their population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 29.55, which is only 26.9% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, allowing both populations to stabilize without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.74, which is only 21.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, ensuring both species can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.35, which is only 17.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.65, which is only 15.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting but prioritizes the sustainability of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.58, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for a slight increase in hunting intensity to help sustain wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A moderate increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without risking a rapid depletion of the sheep."
