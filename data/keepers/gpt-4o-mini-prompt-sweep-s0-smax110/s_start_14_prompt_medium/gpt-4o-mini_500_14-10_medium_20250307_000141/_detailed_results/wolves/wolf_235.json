            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 264\n- Sheep population: 12.62\n- Wolf population: 41.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.400\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.31 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 11.5% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that I can afford to maintain a moderate level of hunting to ensure the wolf population remains healthy. This adjustment allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves. A gradual decrease from my previous theta will help prevent sudden population crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a sustainable balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 96.55, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This adjustment reflects a balanced approach, considering the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 77.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.60, it is wise to adopt a moderate approach to ensure sustainable coexistence. This theta allows for some hunting while also considering the need to compete with other wolves, helping to maintain a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while I want to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I also need to allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and prevent over-depletion of the sheep, while still allowing for some hunting to support wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery. It reflects a balanced approach to ensure both populations can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 41.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.67, it is important to maintain a balanced approach to ensure the long-term survival of both species. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to sustain itself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and a slight increase in hunting intensity will allow for better wolf reproduction while still giving sheep a chance to recover. This adjustment is small and aligns with the current trends, promoting a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.59, which is only 25.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while maintaining a moderate level of hunting to ensure our own survival. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for sustenance with the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.27, which is only 20.2% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being mindful of the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.38, which is only 16.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need to compete with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.81, which is only 14.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more conservative approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.05, which is only 12.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.62, which is only 11.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for sustenance with the long-term health of both species."
