A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow for better coexistence and give the sheep a chance to recover while still providing for my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 29.93, which is only 27.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support our wolf population without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",

This indicates that there is a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 to 0.35 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for some hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of both populations. It also accounts for the growing wolf population, which requires a careful strategy to avoid over-depletion of sheep.",

This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity to 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
