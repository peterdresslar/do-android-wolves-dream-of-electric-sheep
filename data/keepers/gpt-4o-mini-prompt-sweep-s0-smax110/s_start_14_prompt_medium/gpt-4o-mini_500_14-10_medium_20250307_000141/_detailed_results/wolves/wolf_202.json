            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term health of both sheep and wolves. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to ensure we do not deplete the sheep too quickly, especially with the wolf population being relatively high.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A slight decrease from my previous theta will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can stabilize and grow.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.97, which is only 23.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep while still competing with other wolves for resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.75, which is only 18.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support our wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting sustainable coexistence while still being mindful of the need to compete with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.89, which is only 16.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, promoting a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.32, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I need to be cautious about overhunting, a slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted to ensure the wolf population remains healthy. A theta of 0.40 allows for a gradual increase in hunting while still considering the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
