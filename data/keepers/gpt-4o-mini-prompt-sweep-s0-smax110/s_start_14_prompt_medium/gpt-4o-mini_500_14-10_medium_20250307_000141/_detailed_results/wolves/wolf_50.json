            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 83.8% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate hunting approach that can sustain both populations. This value helps ensure that while I maintain a healthy wolf population, I also allow the sheep to recover and thrive, avoiding overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance and avoid over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 64.55, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we are close to a balanced state. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover further while still enabling us to maintain a healthy wolf population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of avoiding sudden changes and fostering sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 34.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. Given the current wolf population, a slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow for better competition among wolves while still enabling some hunting to support reproduction. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low relative to the maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a moderate hunting approach that can help sustain both populations without risking a rapid decline in sheep numbers. This adjustment reflects a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.74, which is only 21.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting while still prioritizing the competition with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.35, which is only 17.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach that supports wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.65, which is only 15.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach that balances our need for food with the sustainability of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.58, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should be cautious with our hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.92, which is only 11.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate increase to 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population and maintaining a healthy balance with the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.01, which is only 10.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is a need to hunt to support the wolf population, I must be cautious not to over-deplete the sheep. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a moderate hunting intensity that can help sustain both populations without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.29, which is only 10.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to stabilize while still competing with other wolves. This moderate approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.92, which is only 9.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.80, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and allowing the sheep to increase in number, ensuring long-term sustainability."
