            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This balance will help sustain both populations while also supporting the growth of the wolf pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 87.8% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover if needed. A gradual adjustment is key to sustaining the balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 77.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 53.00, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that can support both wolf reproduction and sheep recovery. This balance helps to prevent over-depletion of the sheep while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, and while it is beneficial to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must also consider the growing wolf population. A theta of 0.40 allows for a balanced approach that supports both species without risking a rapid depletion of sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 41.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 68, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 32.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 68, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still providing enough sustenance for the wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.59, which is only 25.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I can increase my hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate increase to 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, ensuring both populations can thrive without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.27, which is only 20.2% of its maximum capacity. While I want to ensure my pack thrives, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, allowing both populations to stabilize without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.38, which is only 16.7% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.81, which is only 14.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the immediate needs of the pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.05, which is only 12.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I can increase my hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate increase to 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.62, which is only 11.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to allow for sheep recovery. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.82, which is only 10.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is an opportunity to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A gradual increase to 0.40 strikes a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability."
