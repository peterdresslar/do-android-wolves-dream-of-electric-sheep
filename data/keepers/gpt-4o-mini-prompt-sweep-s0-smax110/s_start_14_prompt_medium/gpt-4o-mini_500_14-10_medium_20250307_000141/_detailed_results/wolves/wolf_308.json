            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 95.64, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing for sustainable coexistence with the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 75.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with the wolf population at 54, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term survival while still allowing for some growth in the wolf pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the sheep-to-wolf ratio being 0.85, it is important to maintain a sustainable coexistence. A slight reduction from my previous theta will help ensure that both populations can thrive without depleting the sheep too quickly, while still allowing for some hunting to support wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing sustainability. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance as the wolf population grows, ensuring we do not deplete the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and while I need to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.23, which is only 24.8% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A moderate adjustment helps maintain balance and allows for potential recovery of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.60, which is only 19.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is potential for recovery in the sheep population if I reduce my hunting intensity slightly. By lowering theta to 0.40, I can focus more on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, promoting a more sustainable balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.91, which is only 16.3% of its maximum capacity. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still providing enough sustenance for the wolf population. This approach balances the need for hunting with the necessity of ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.50, which is only 14.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more moderate hunting intensity is necessary to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain its health. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help balance the need for hunting with the sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.55, which is only 12.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.400 to 0.35, I can focus on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.45, which is only 11.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain our wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.61, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to allow the sheep population to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.05, which is only 10% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to increase. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid sudden crashes in either population."
