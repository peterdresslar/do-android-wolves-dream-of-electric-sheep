            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta balances the need for hunting with the necessity of maintaining a sustainable sheep population, while also considering the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at maximum capacity, and a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This approach helps maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem and supports the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 4.78, it",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. A moderate approach will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can stabilize, which is crucial for long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and while I need to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, I must remain cautious and avoid overhunting, as the wolf population is relatively stable. A gradual increase will help maintain balance without risking a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while maintaining a sustainable balance with the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep do not become over-depleted. A moderate approach allows for sustainable coexistence as we adapt to the current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight decrease in hunting intensity to promote sustainability. This adjustment will help maintain a balance between the wolf and sheep populations while avoiding over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This approach balances the needs of both populations and avoids overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the wolf population is relatively high. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still providing enough resources for the wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population also being relatively high, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 29.60, which is only 26.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A slight decrease from my previous theta of 0.450 will help balance our needs with the sustainability of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.26, which is only 21.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need to compete with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.58, which is only 16.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.04, which is only 14.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep too quickly."
