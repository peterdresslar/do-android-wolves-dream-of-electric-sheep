            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. A gradual increase from my previous theta will help balance competition with other wolves while still considering the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. A moderate hunting intensity will allow for some sheep depletion while also giving time for the sheep to recover and ensuring that the wolf population remains healthy. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This will help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A gradual increase is necessary to adapt to the current conditions and ensure long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 87.8% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 45, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both populations can thrive. A gradual increase to 0.45 allows for sustainable coexistence while still promoting wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 77.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still a healthy number of sheep available. However, with the wolf population at 53, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure sustainable coexistence. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling my pack to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because it represents a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balanced approach. The sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and a moderate increase in hunting will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. This adjustment allows for a dynamic response to the current conditions, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and the wolf population is slightly high. A moderate hunting intensity will allow for some sheep recovery while also preventing overcompetition among wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term survival of both species. This adjustment helps maintain a balance as the sheep population is recovering, and it allows for gradual adaptation to the current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 32.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 68, I need to be cautious about overhunting. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.59, which is only 25.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is potential for recovery, I need to be cautious about hunting intensity to allow the sheep to rebound. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both populations, especially as the wolf population is relatively high.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.27, which is only 20.2% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. A small adjustment from 0.35 to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, promoting coexistence and sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.38, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking over-depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.81, which is only 14.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing our need for sustenance with the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.05, which is only 12.8% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability without depleting the sheep further."
