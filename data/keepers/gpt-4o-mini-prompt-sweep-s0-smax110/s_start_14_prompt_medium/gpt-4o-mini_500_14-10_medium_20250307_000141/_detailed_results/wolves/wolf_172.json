            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 195\n- Sheep population: 11.72\n- Wolf population: 35.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.350\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.33 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 10.7% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 105.60, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently healthy, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing sheep to recover. A gradual adjustment is necessary to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 77.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with the wolf population at 53.00, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 50.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a wolf population of 67, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is relatively low at 0.83, suggesting that we should focus on a balanced approach to allow both populations to stabilize. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help ensure the long-term survival of both species while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.36, which is only 29.4% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance and prevent over-depletion of the sheep, while still allowing for some hunting to support wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.97, which is only 23.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still being mindful of the wolf population growth.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.75, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance, ensuring that both sheep and wolves can thrive without depleting resources too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.89, which is only 16.3% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, a slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain the balance without depleting the sheep too quickly. This moderate adjustment allows for sustainable coexistence while still addressing the needs of the wolf pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.32, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to stabilize while still enabling the wolf population to maintain its health. This moderate approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.67, which is only 12.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.45, which is only 11.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate increase to 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.72, which is only 10.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should be cautious with our hunting to allow the sheep to recover. However, with a wolf population of 35, a slight increase in hunting intensity to 0.40 will help maintain our numbers without depleting the sheep too quickly. This adjustment reflects a balanced approach, allowing for sustainable coexistence."
