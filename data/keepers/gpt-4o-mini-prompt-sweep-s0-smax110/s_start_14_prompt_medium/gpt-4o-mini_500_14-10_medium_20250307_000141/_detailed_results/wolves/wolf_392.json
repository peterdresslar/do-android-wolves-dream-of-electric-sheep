            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population while still considering the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 41.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 70, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 31.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 71.00, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting, which could lead to a decline in sheep numbers and ultimately harm both species. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.14, which is only 23.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.66, which is only 18.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population and maintaining a balance with the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.35, which is only 15.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a more balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the immediate needs of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we are at risk of overhunting. A moderate approach allows for some hunting while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both our pack and the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.08, which is only 11.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while ensuring the sheep population has a chance to rebound, promoting long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.93, which is only 10.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be slightly increased to support wolf reproduction, it is crucial to avoid overhunting to allow the sheep population to recover. A gradual increase to 0.35 reflects a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while being mindful of the delicate ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.20, which is only 10.2% of its maximum capacity. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.30, it is crucial to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A lower theta will help maintain balance and prevent overhunting, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",

This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting to support the wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.46, which is only 9.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.38, which is only 9.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I need to be cautious about overhunting, a slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted to ensure my pack",

A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a gradual adjustment towards hunting while still being cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. This approach supports both the wolf population",

This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.400 to 0.35, I can focus on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.73, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help balance our needs without depleting the sheep further.",
