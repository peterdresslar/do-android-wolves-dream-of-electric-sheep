A moderate approach will help maintain balance and prevent overhunting, ensuring both species can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. A moderate approach will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term survival for both.",

This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 97.34, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that can support wolf reproduction while also giving sheep a chance to recover. This approach helps maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep, ensuring the long-term survival of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 78.7% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 52, it",

This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly, ensuring long-term sustainability.",

However, with the wolf population at 67, I need to be cautious about overhunting. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population.",

While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support reproduction, while still prioritizing the sustainability of both species.",
