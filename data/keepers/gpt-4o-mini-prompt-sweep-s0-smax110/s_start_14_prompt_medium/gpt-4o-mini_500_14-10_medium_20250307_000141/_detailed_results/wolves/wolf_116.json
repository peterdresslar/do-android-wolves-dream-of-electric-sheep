            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and the wolf population is growing. A lower theta allows for more competition among wolves, which can help stabilize our numbers while giving sheep a chance to recover. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual adjustment is necessary to maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, I must remain cautious and avoid overhunting, as the wolf population is also significant. A gradual increase to 0.40 allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still enabling the sheep to recover gradually.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover gradually.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 27.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 66, it is wise to maintain a cautious approach to hunting to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight reduction from my previous theta allows for a balanced coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.69, which is only 22.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.30, which is only 18.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it is crucial to avoid overexploitation. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population and maintaining a balance with the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.94, which is only 15.4% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still being cautious. A theta of 0.40 reflects a balanced approach that supports both the wolf population and allows for some recovery of the sheep, avoiding overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.08, which is only 13.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is potential for recovery, it is important to prioritize the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.53, which is only 12.3% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable balance, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting. This lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and promote long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.43, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we are nearing a critical point for sustainable hunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a bit more hunting to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious to avoid depleting the sheep population further. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining balance and responding to the current ecosystem state.",

This adjustment will help support the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover gradually. A moderate increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, considering both the current state and the need for sustainable coexistence.",

This suggests that we should be cautious with our hunting to allow the sheep to recover.
