            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level relative to the maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. This approach supports long-term sustainability and avoids depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 29.55, which is only 26.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is an opportunity to hunt, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This balanced approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining sustainable cycles.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.74, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between our population and the sheep, ensuring both can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.35, which is only 17.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for moderate hunting to help sustain our wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of our pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.65, which is only 15.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting a lower theta, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize while avoiding overhunting. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.58, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for a slight increase in hunting intensity to help sustain wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A gradual increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, considering both the need for wolves to thrive and the importance of not depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.92, which is only 11.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 to 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need to compete with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to support wolf reproduction.",
