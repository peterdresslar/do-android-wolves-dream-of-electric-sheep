            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that we should reduce hunting intensity to allow for recovery. A moderate theta value will help maintain a balance between our needs and the sustainability of the sheep population, ensuring long-term survival for both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A theta of 0.45 strikes a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can stabilize, promoting long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 4.07, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in sheep numbers, jeopardizing the long-term survival of both species. Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover while keeping the wolf population stable.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and a slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain the balance without depleting the sheep too quickly. This moderate adjustment allows for sustainable coexistence while also supporting the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, I must remain cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep. A gradual adjustment helps maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 95.64, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, but I need to be cautious as the wolf population is also significant. A slight decrease in hunting intensity allows for a sustainable balance, giving sheep a chance to recover while still ensuring the wolf population remains healthy.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 51.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population being slightly higher than the sheep population, I need to focus on maintaining balance and avoid overhunting. A slight decrease in theta allows for a more cautious approach while still enabling some hunting to support wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring the sheep can recover and thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level relative to its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A slight decrease from my previous theta will help balance the needs of both populations while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and while I need to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.60, which is only 19.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 strikes a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep can rebound, promoting long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.91, which is only 16.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still recognizing the need to adapt to the current conditions.",

While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I also want to allow the sheep to recover.
