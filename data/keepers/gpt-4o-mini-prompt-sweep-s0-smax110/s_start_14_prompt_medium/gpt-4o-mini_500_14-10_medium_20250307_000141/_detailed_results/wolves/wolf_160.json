            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at its maximum capacity, indicating that we should be cautious with our hunting to avoid depleting their numbers too quickly. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will allow us to maintain a healthy wolf population while still giving the sheep a chance to recover in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. A moderate theta will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can stabilize, promoting long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and while I want to ensure the survival of my pack, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A moderate approach will help maintain balance and prevent overhunting, which could lead to a crash in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and a slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain the balance while allowing for some recovery. This adjustment is gradual, ensuring that we do not deplete the sheep too quickly while still supporting our wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction without overly depleting the sheep, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 96.75, allowing for a moderate approach to hunting. This value will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can recover. It reflects a cautious strategy that prioritizes sustainability while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 85.27, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 53.00, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while I want to ensure my pack thrives, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and prevent over-depletion of the sheep population, ensuring long-term survival for both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 38.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.60, it is important to maintain a balance that allows the sheep to recover while also ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help foster a sustainable coexistence, allowing both populations to thrive without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 29.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for recovery. With a wolf population of 70, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is low, suggesting that we should focus on competing with other wolves to ensure our own survival while allowing the sheep to replenish. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance without overexploiting the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.97, which is only 23.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without risking a crash in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.75, which is only 18.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased slightly, it is crucial to prioritize the recovery of the sheep population to ensure long-term sustainability. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring a balanced approach.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.89, which is only 16.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.32, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I need to maintain some hunting to support wolf reproduction, I should focus more on competition with other wolves to allow the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the needs of both populations."
