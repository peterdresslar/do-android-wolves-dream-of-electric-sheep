A balanced approach will help sustain both populations, as the wolf numbers are relatively stable. Gradually reducing hunting intensity will prevent depletion of the sheep while still allowing for some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. With a high sheep-to-wolf ratio and a growing wolf population, focusing on competition among wolves will help maintain balance and prevent overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 4.78, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. With a high sheep-to-wolf ratio, focusing on competition with other wolves will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to depletion of their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover while also keeping the wolf population stable. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring both populations can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing sheep to recover. It reflects a balanced approach, responding to the current conditions and trends.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without drastically depleting the sheep population, ensuring long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, and the wolf population is slightly high. A theta of 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, enabling some hunting while still giving sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment helps maintain sustainability in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 41.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 68, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both populations can thrive. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves.",

However, with the wolf population at 68, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both populations can thrive. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.59, which is only 25.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is an opportunity to hunt, I need to be cautious and avoid overexploitation. A moderate approach will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to thrive. Gradually reducing hunting intensity will help maintain a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.27, which is only 20.2% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still being mindful of the need for sustainability. A gradual increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for some hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.38, which is only 16.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate increase to 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population and maintaining a balance with the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.81, which is only 14.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for wolves to thrive."
