            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 403\n- Sheep population: 26.14\n- Wolf population: 69.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.400\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.38 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 23.8% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

With a high sheep-to-wolf ratio and a growing wolf population, a moderate approach will help maintain balance and prevent depletion of the sheep while ensuring the wolves can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively low. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also reducing competition among wolves. This approach will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",

With the wolf population also present, a lower theta will help maintain balance and prevent overexploitation of the sheep, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",

Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover while also managing competition with other wolves. This balanced approach supports the long-term survival of both species.",

This approach promotes a sustainable balance between both populations, ensuring long-term survival.",

This will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover if needed. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance and avoid over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because it represents a balanced approach to hunting and competition. The sheep population is currently healthy, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a sustainable coexistence while also supporting the wolf population's needs.",

This value reflects a balanced approach, enabling us to sustain our wolf population while still allowing sheep to recover and thrive. It aligns with the wisdom of making gradual adjustments based on current trends.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover. A gradual increase is necessary to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly, and it aligns with the wisdom of adapting to current conditions.",
