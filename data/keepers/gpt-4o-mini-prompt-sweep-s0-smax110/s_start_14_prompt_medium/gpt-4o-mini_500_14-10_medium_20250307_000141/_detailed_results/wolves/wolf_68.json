            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 64.55, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction. However, I must be cautious not to overhunt, as the sheep population is only at 58.7% of its maximum capacity. This adjustment will help maintain a balance while ensuring both populations can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for some increased hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery. A gradual increase aligns with the current trends and maintains a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is necessary to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly, and this theta strikes a balance between competing with other wolves and hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 29.55, which is only 26.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, enabling us to hunt enough to support our population while still allowing the sheep to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.74, which is only 21.6% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure and promote a healthier ecosystem balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.35, which is only 17.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly, considering the current wolf population is relatively high.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.65, which is only 15.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support our wolf population without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.58, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.92, which is only 11.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.4 to 0.35, I can maintain a balance that focuses on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.01, which is only 10.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should be cautious with our hunting to allow the sheep to recover. However, with a wolf population of 38, a slight increase in hunting intensity to 0.40 will help maintain our population without depleting the sheep too quickly. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of making gradual changes to ensure a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.29, which is only 10.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 reflects a slight increase in hunting compared to my previous value, allowing for some reproduction while still prioritizing the sustainability of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.92, which is only 9.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still being mindful of the need to avoid overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.80, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance and support the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low at 10.77, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable balance, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensifying hunting. This will help stabilize the ecosystem and promote long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.89, which is only 9.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while giving sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.13, which is only 10.1% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help me maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.40, which is only 10.4% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 will enable me to hunt more effectively without depleting the sheep population too quickly. This approach supports a gradual balance between hunting and competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.75, which is only 10.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it is crucial to prioritize the recovery of the sheep population to ensure long-term sustainability. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while also focusing on reducing competition with other wolves, which is necessary given the current wolf population of 14. This approach aims to create a balanced ecosystem without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.25, which is only 11.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some reproduction among wolves while still enabling the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.83, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking over-depletion. This moderate adjustment will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover gradually. It reflects a balanced approach to ensure long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.42, which is only 12.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight reduction from my previous theta allows for a more balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still enabling some hunting to support reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.17, which is only 12.9% of maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to help sustain our wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the immediate needs of my pack.",
