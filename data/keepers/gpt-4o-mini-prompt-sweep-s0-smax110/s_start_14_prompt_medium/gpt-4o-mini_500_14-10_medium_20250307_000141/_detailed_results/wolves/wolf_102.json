            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that we should maintain a balanced approach to hunting. A moderate theta allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves. This adjustment helps prevent over-depletion of the sheep population and supports the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that we should maintain a balanced approach to hunting. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some hunting to support our wolf population. This adjustment helps prevent over-depletion of the sheep and ensures our long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This approach balances our needs with the ecosystem",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover and thrive. A gradual increase aligns with the wisdom of adapting to current conditions and trends.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 67.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with the wolf population also being relatively high, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual increase aligns with the current trends and ensures a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.72, it is important to maintain a balanced approach to ensure the sustainability of both populations. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still supporting the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing coexistence. This adjustment reflects the need to balance the growing wolf population with the available sheep, ensuring both can thrive without depleting resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 29.93, which is only 27.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover rather than intensifying our hunting. A moderate theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can rebound, promoting long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.69, which is only 22.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still considering the need for sheep recovery and the overall balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.30, which is only 18.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while being mindful of the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.94, which is only 15.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack, but not so much that it further depletes the sheep. This approach supports long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.08, which is only 13.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.53, which is only 12.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while maintaining a moderate hunting intensity.
