            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still considering the long-term health of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for some increased hunting intensity without risking depletion. Given that the sheep population is at 53.1% of maximum capacity, I can afford to increase my hunting slightly to support wolf reproduction while still being mindful of the need for sustainable coexistence. This adjustment is gradual and considers the current trends in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 41.6% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This balance supports the wolf population while ensuring that sheep can recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 32.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 68, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.59, which is only 25.1% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain a balance and prevent overhunting, which could lead to a crash in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.27, which is only 20.2% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain balance and avoid sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.38, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help sustain both the wolf and sheep populations while allowing for gradual adaptation to changing conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.81, which is only 14.4% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing competition with other wolves, which is necessary given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.31.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.05, which is only 12.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach, promoting coexistence without risking a rapid depletion of sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.62, which is only 11.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is an opportunity for hunting, I need to be cautious to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring that both populations can stabilize and thrive in the long term.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.20, which is only 10.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while maintaining a stable wolf population. A moderate theta value will help us balance our hunting needs with the sustainability of the sheep, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.89, which is only 9.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover, and focusing on competition with other wolves will help maintain our population while allowing the sheep to bounce back. A lower theta will promote a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.75, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, enabling some hunting while still considering the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.83, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should maintain a cautious approach to hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help balance the need for hunting with the necessity of sustaining the sheep population, while also considering the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.02, which is only 10.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing our own population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach that prioritizes the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.28, which is only 10.3% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.35 helps maintain balance and sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.61, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for the sheep to recover. By setting a lower theta, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I need to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.55, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations while allowing for some growth in the wolf pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.16, which is only 12.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 strikes a balance between competing with other wolves and allowing the sheep population to stabilize, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.89, which is only 12.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for wolves to thrive."
