            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 55.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population being slightly higher than the sheep population, I need to prioritize competition among wolves to prevent overhunting. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring both populations can thrive without depleting resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 67.00, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A moderate increase to 0.40 allows for some hunting while still considering the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment reflects a balanced approach, considering both the current sheep population and the growing wolf numbers. It allows for continued reproduction while maintaining the health of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 29.93, which is only 27.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight reduction in hunting intensity allows for a more sustainable balance, giving sheep a chance to recover while still enabling wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.69, which is only 22.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for moderate hunting without risking depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.30, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we are competing for limited resources. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling us to maintain our wolf population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of making gradual adjustments to ensure long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.94, which is only 15.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity to 0.35, I can still focus on competition with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.08, which is only 13.7% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will enable me to hunt more effectively without depleting the sheep population too quickly. This moderate adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a balance between hunting and competition.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.53, which is only 12.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing our need for sustenance with the necessity of ensuring the sheep can rebound.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.43, which is only 11.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.77, which is only 10.7% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a focus on competition with other wolves, a slight reduction in hunting intensity is appropriate. This will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
