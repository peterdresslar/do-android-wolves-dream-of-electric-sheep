By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while avoiding over-depletion of the sheep.",

With a high sheep-to-wolf ratio, focusing on competition among wolves is more prudent to ensure long-term sustainability for both species.",

Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover and ensures the long-term survival of both species. It also helps to stabilize the wolf population as we focus on competition among ourselves rather than overhunting.",

However, with the wolf population at 69, which is relatively high, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep.",
