            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 94.6% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and maintain a balance. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 94.40, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while maintaining a sustainable balance. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction without risking a rapid decline in the sheep population, ensuring long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must also consider the potential for overhunting. A slight decrease in theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring that both sheep and wolves can thrive without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population being close to the sheep population, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 45.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.72, it is important to maintain a balanced approach to ensure the long-term survival of both species. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 37.90, which is only 34.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is some room for hunting, it is essential to be cautious and avoid overexploitation. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population and maintaining a balance with the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 29.60, which is only 26.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some reproduction among wolves while still giving sheep a chance to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.26, which is only 21.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach to hunting while still being mindful of the wolf population, which is currently at 65.00. This adjustment aims to promote coexistence and prevent any drastic changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.58, which is only 16.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of avoiding sudden changes and promotes a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.04, which is only 14.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without risking a rapid depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.87, which is only 12.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.4 to 0.35, I can maintain a focus on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.63, which is only 11.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain our wolf population without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for gradual adjustments.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.52, which is only 10.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus more on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This gradual adjustment helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
