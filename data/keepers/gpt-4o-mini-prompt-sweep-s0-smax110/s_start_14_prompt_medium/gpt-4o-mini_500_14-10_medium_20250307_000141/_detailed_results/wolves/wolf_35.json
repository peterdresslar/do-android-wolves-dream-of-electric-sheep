            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 55\n- Sheep population: 12.92\n- Wolf population: 43.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.450\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.30 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 11.7% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that a slight increase in hunting intensity is appropriate to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 93.7% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 39, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure sustainable coexistence. A gradual increase to 0.40 allows for some growth in wolf numbers while still being mindful of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. It reflects a cautious approach to ensure both populations can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 72.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with the wolf population at 55.00, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is relatively high at 1.44. To ensure long-term sustainability, I will adopt a slightly lower hunting intensity to allow for a gradual recovery of the sheep population while still enabling some hunting to support the wolf pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep. This adjustment reflects the need to maintain a healthy wolf population without over-depleting the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 45.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 67, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still providing enough sustenance for the wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover gradually.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 29.55, which is only 26.9% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, a moderate approach allows for some hunting while still giving sheep a chance to recover. This balance will help sustain both populations in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.74, which is only 21.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done gradually to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balance between hunting and ensuring the sheep can recover, while also considering the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.35, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that competition among wolves is high. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for a slight focus on competition, which can help stabilize the wolf population while giving sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.65, which is only 15.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.58, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A moderate increase from my previous theta of 0.400 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.92, which is only 11.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to focus more on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack without depleting the sheep further, promoting a healthier balance."
