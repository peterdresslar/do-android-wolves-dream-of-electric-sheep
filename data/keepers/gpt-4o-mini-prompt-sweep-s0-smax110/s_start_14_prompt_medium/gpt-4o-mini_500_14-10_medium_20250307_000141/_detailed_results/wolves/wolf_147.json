A theta of 0.45 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for some hunting while ensuring the sheep population can stabilize and grow. This will help maintain a sustainable ecosystem and prevent future crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help maintain a balance between the wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term survival for both. This gradual adjustment will also help prevent overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 7.86, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to depletion of the sheep. Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover while also managing competition with other wolves. This balance is crucial for the long-term survival of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery and sustainability. Maintaining a lower theta will help prevent overexploitation of the sheep while allowing the wolf population to stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to depletion. Maintaining a lower theta allows the sheep to recover while we focus on competition among wolves, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers.

Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover and ensures the long-term survival of both species. This balanced approach will help sustain our ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be cautiously increased to avoid depleting their numbers too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and a slight increase in hunting intensity will help manage their numbers while still allowing for recovery. This moderate adjustment balances the need for wolf reproduction with the sustainability of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 96% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help sustain our wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover if needed.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 96.75, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to maintain balance, as the wolf population is also significant at 45. I aim to avoid overhunting while still allowing for some growth in the wolf pack.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep do not become overly depleted. A moderate increase aligns with the current trends and promotes a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 50.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 67, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both populations can thrive. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 38.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. Given the current wolf population, a slight reduction in hunting intensity from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, fostering coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.36, which is only 29.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack without depleting the sheep further, promoting a more balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.97, which is only 23.6% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still being cautious. A small adjustment to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for some hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.75, which is only 18.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate increase to 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population and maintaining a balance with the growing wolf population."
