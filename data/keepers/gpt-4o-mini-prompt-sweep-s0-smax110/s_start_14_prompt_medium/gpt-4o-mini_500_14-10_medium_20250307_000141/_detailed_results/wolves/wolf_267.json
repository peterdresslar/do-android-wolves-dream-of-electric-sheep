            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, I must remain cautious as the wolf population is also high. A moderate increase will help maintain our numbers while ensuring the sheep can recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 41.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 68, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 32.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 68, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.59, which is only 25.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still giving the sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.27, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we are nearing a critical point for sustainable hunting. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain itself. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.38, which is only 16.7% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.81, which is only 14.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.05, which is only 12.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from the previous theta of 0.40 to 0.35, I can still maintain a focus on competition with other wolves while allowing for some sustainable hunting. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.62, which is only 11.5% of its maximum capacity. While I need to maintain a balance to ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, a slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted to support wolf reproduction. However, I must be cautious and avoid drastic changes, as the wolf population is already at 41.00, and I want to prevent over-depletion of the sheep. A gradual increase to 0.40 allows for sustainable coexistence while still addressing the immediate needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.82, which is only 10.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for sheep to recover, and a lower hunting intensity will help maintain their numbers while allowing the wolf population to stabilize. Gradually reducing hunting intensity will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.20, which is only 10.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room to increase hunting intensity slightly without risking a drastic depletion of the sheep. A small increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.89, which is only 9.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that the sheep need time to recover. By setting a lower theta, I can focus more on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.75, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure their long-term survival, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensifying hunting. This will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.83, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting to support the wolf population.
