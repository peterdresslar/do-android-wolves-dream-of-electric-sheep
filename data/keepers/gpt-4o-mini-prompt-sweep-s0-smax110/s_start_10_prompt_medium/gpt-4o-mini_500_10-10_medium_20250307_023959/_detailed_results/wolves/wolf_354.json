Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover and ensures the long-term survival of both species. It also helps to stabilize the wolf population as we adapt to the current conditions.",

Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to recover, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that they can sustain some increased hunting pressure without immediate risk of depletion. However, with the wolf population also being relatively stable, a moderate increase in hunting intensity allows for a gradual adjustment while still considering the long-term health of both populations.",

This will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 90.59, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to ensure that both populations can thrive without depleting resources too quickly.",

This will help maintain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",

By slightly decreasing my hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both sheep and wolves while still maintaining a focus on competition with other wolves.",

This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still giving sheep a chance to recover.",

This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for more effective hunting while still considering the long-term survival of both species.
