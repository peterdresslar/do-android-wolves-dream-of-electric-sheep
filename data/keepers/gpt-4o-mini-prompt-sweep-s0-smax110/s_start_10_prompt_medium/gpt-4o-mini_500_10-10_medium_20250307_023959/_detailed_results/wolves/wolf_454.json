            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 81.45, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help support wolf reproduction while ensuring that the sheep population does not deplete too quickly. A theta of 0.75 strikes a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is key to avoiding any drastic impacts on either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly, and this theta reflects a balanced approach to coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level relative to the maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. By adopting a moderate approach, I can ensure the long-term survival of both species while still allowing for some hunting to support the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 30.28, which is only 27.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is some room for hunting, it is crucial to avoid overexploitation. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.35, which is only 22.1% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to help sustain wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A gradual increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for some hunting while still considering the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.57, which is only 17.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is an opportunity to hunt, it is crucial to avoid overexploitation to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term balance and health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.00, which is only 15.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.63, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without risking depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for more effective hunting while still being cautious about the sheep population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.91, which is only 11.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.92, which is only 10.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting sustainability without risking a crash in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.20, which is only 10.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.75, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help stabilize the ecosystem and avoid depleting the sheep further, while also being mindful of the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.61, which is only 9.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should be cautious with our hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach, promoting sustainable coexistence while still enabling some hunting to support our wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.50, which is only 9.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to be cautious with our hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting to support our wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.52, which is only 9.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to recover while also reducing competition among wolves. A gradual approach will help maintain balance in the ecosystem."
