            "I chose this theta because it represents a balanced approach to hunting. The sheep population is healthy at 101.97, allowing for moderate hunting without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a sustainable coexistence while also considering the gradual increase in wolf numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 81.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with a wolf population of 50, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term health of both populations. This moderate adjustment will help maintain balance as the wolf population grows.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 41.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 69, which is relatively high, I need to be cautious about overhunting. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual increase in theta reflects the need to balance our hunting with the current sheep population and the growing wolf numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.55, which is only 24.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus more on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack without depleting the sheep further, promoting a healthier balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.68, which is only 18.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some reproduction among wolves while still giving sheep a chance to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without risking a rapid decline in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.33, which is only 15.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased slightly, it is important to prioritize the recovery of the sheep population to ensure long-term sustainability. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the wolf population is relatively high. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.13, which is only 11.9% of its maximum capacity. A lower theta allows for more competition among wolves, which can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.92, which is only 10.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for gradual adjustments.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we are at risk of overhunting. A moderate approach will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling us to compete with other wolves. This gradual adjustment helps maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.77, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance."
