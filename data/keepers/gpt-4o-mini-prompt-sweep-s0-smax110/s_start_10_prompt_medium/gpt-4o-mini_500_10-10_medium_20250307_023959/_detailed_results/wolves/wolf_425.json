            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. A lower theta will help maintain a balance between competing wolves and the sheep population, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at maximum capacity, and my previous theta was already at a low level. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover and prevents overexploitation, which is crucial for long-term sustainability. Additionally, with the wolf population at 29, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at its maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that a slight increase in hunting intensity is appropriate to maintain balance and support wolf reproduction. However, I must be cautious and avoid drastic changes, as the wolf population is also relatively stable. A gradual increase allows for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 94.4% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 41, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 85.4% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 49, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to ensure that both populations can thrive without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, I must remain cautious and avoid overhunting, as the wolf population is also significant. A gradual adjustment will help maintain balance and ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 47.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.75, it's important to maintain a balance that allows both populations to thrive. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can help ensure the sheep recover while still allowing for some hunting to support the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 30.28, which is only 27.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is potential for recovery, I need to be cautious about hunting intensity to allow the sheep to rebound. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.35, which is only 22.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach to hunting while still being mindful of the wolf population growth.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.57, which is only 17.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.4 to 0.35, I can maintain a focus on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.00, which is only 15.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is potential for recovery in the sheep population if I maintain a moderate hunting intensity. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.35 to 0.40, I can still focus on hunting while allowing the sheep to recover, ensuring a sustainable balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.63, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize without depleting their numbers further. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem."
