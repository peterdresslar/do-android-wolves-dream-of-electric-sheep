            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 77.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.65, it is important to focus on competition with other wolves to ensure our population remains stable. A gradual increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term balance of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 64.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with the wolf population at 60, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is relatively high at 1.18, suggesting that we should be cautious about overhunting. A moderate increase to 0.35 allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still enabling the sheep population to recover and maintain balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 50.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 67, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that supports both sheep recovery and wolf population stability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 29.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 69, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.05, which is only 22.8% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A moderate increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance as both populations adjust.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.09, which is only 18.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing competition with other wolves, which will help stabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.98, which is only 15.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some reproduction among wolves while still giving sheep a chance to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep population too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.68, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support our wolf population without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.19, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a need for caution in hunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a more balanced approach, promoting wolf health while giving sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. A moderate approach will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can grow, which is essential for the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.44, which is only 10.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for more hunting to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious about the sheep population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.03, which is only 10% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting. This will help balance the ecosystem and prevent a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.82, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach to hunting while still considering the need for wolf population stability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.77, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are struggling, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to recover while also reducing competition among wolves. A gradual adjustment is necessary to ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.90, which is only 9.9% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable balance, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting. This will help the sheep population stabilize while also allowing for gradual adjustments in the future as conditions change."
