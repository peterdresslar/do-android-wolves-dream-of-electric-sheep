            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is necessary to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly, as the current sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we need to be mindful of our hunting practices.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 41.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, the wolf population is relatively high, so I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A moderate adjustment to 0.65 allows for continued hunting while also considering the need to maintain a balance with the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.55, which is only 24.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I can increase my hunting intensity slightly, I should still prioritize a balanced approach to allow the sheep population to recover. A theta of 0.45 reflects a moderate increase in hunting while being cautious not to deplete the sheep further, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.68, which is only 18.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is some opportunity for hunting, it is crucial to avoid overexploitation to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.33, which is only 15.8% of its maximum capacity. While I need to increase my hunting intensity to ensure the survival of my pack, I must do so gradually to avoid depleting the sheep population too quickly. A theta of 0.40 allows for a slight increase in hunting while still considering the long-term sustainability of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.80, which is only 13.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can help the sheep population stabilize while still allowing for some hunting to support the wolf population. This moderate approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.13, which is only 11.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly, considering the need for sustainable cycles.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.92, which is only 10.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to allow the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 reflects a balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our reproductive needs.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.11, which is only 10.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.77, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while I need to focus on hunting to ensure the survival of my pack, I must do so cautiously to allow the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of my pack.",
