            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover and prevent overexploitation. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 4.58, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that we should be cautious with our hunting to prevent depleting their numbers. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and a slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted to maintain balance. However, I must be cautious not to overhunt, as the wolf population is relatively stable. This moderate increase allows for sustainable coexistence while ensuring that both populations can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating a need for cautious hunting to prevent depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for sustainable hunting while still considering the growing wolf population. This approach balances immediate needs with long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 89.7% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to ensure that both sheep and wolf populations remain sustainable.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help sustain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover and thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 64.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity from 0.450 to 0.40, I can focus on maintaining a balance that allows both sheep and wolves to thrive. This moderate approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both populations while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 50.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 67, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to maintain balance. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still considering the long-term health of both populations.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.08, which is only 29.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 allows for a more balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to overhunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.05, which is only 22.8% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.45 to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, focusing on sustainable coexistence while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.09, which is only 18.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate increase to 0.35 allows for some hunting while still focusing on the competition among wolves, promoting a more sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.98, which is only 15.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still being cautious about the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.68, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support our wolf population without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance."
