            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that they are thriving. However, with a high sheep-to-wolf ratio, I need to be cautious about overhunting. A theta of 0.75 allows for increased hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being mindful of the sheep population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to prevent depletion. A theta of 0.60 allows for a balanced approach, enabling some hunting while still considering the long-term sustainability of both sheep and wolves. This adjustment reflects the need to adapt to the current high sheep population while being cautious of the growing wolf numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at its maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A balanced approach will help sustain both populations, especially as the wolf population is relatively low. This adjustment will support coexistence while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at its maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. A lower theta will help maintain the balance between wolves and sheep, ensuring long-term sustainability while also addressing the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover and maintain a sustainable balance. This lower theta will help prevent overexploitation of the sheep while still allowing for some competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow the sheep to recover. Maintaining a lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both species and prevent over-depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery. Maintaining a focus on competition with other wolves will help stabilize our population while preventing overhunting of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery and prevent depletion. Maintaining a steady focus on competition with other wolves will help stabilize our population while ensuring the sheep can bounce back.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be increased slightly to ensure the wolves can thrive without depleting the sheep too quickly. A gradual increase allows for sustainable coexistence while also considering the current wolf population, which is relatively stable.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help maintain a balance that allows the sheep to recover while ensuring the wolf population does not grow unsustainably.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at its maximum capacity, and while I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta will enable me to maintain some hunting while still being cautious about over-depleting the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover and prevent overexploitation. This lower theta will help maintain a balance while avoiding competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that a slight increase in hunting intensity is appropriate to maintain balance and support wolf reproduction. However, I must be cautious and avoid overhunting, as the wolf population is still relatively low. A moderate increase allows for sustainable coexistence while keeping an eye on future trends.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still healthy at 101.97, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, the wolf population is also significant at 41.00, so I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A moderate increase to 0.45 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for sustainable coexistence while still promoting wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 89.82, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we have enough prey to sustain our pack. However, with the wolf population at 50, it's wise to focus slightly more on competition among wolves to prevent overpopulation and allow the sheep to recover. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance without risking a depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment reflects a balance between ensuring our wolf population remains healthy while allowing the sheep to recover and thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both populations. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to maintain balance, as the wolf population is slightly high relative to the sheep. A gradual decrease in hunting intensity will help prevent over-depletion of the sheep while allowing for some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.64, which is only 31.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is some room for hunting, it is essential to avoid overexploitation. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a more cautious approach, focusing on maintaining the sheep population while still enabling some hunting to support the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.55, which is only 24.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A moderate increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.45 reflects a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without risking depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.68, which is only 18.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to allow for recovery. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of both populations. This approach helps maintain a balance as the wolf population is relatively high."
