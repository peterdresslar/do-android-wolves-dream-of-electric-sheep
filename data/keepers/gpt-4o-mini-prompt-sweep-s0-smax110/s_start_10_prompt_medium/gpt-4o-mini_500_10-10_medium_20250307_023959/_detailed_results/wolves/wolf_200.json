However, with the wolf population at 65, which is relatively high compared to the sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves while allowing the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.38 allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without overwhelming the sheep, promoting a sustainable balance.",

However, with the wolf population at 70, which is relatively high, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring that both populations can thrive without leading to depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.55, which is only 24.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of the wolf pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.68, which is only 18.8% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population, a lower theta value will help reduce hunting intensity and focus on competition with other wolves. This approach will promote a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",

While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I also want to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase in hunting intensity to 0.40 will help maintain a balance, promoting wolf reproduction while still being mindful of the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.80, which is only 13.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",

This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it is crucial to prioritize the recovery of the sheep population to ensure long-term sustainability. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow sheep to recover while still enabling wolves to compete effectively.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.35, which is only 9.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.35 to 0.40, I can still support my pack",

A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, allowing both populations to stabilize without risking over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.23, which is only 12.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for sustainable cycles."
