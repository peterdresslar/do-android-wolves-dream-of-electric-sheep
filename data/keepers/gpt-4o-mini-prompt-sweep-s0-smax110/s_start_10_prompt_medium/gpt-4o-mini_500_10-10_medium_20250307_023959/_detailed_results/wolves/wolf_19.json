            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. With a high sheep-to-wolf ratio, focusing on competition with other wolves will help stabilize our population while giving the sheep a chance to rebound.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover and prevent overexploitation. This lower theta will help maintain a balance while we adapt to the current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively low. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover and prevents overexploitation, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and the need to balance competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery. Maintaining a lower theta will help ensure the sheep can rebound while we focus on competing with other wolves, thus promoting long-term balance in the ecosystem.",

A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the balance between our populations. This approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that a slight increase in hunting intensity is appropriate to ensure the wolf population can thrive. However, I must be cautious and avoid drastic changes, as the wolf population is still relatively low. A gradual increase allows for sustainable coexistence while still addressing the immediate needs of the pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking over-depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual increase is essential to avoid sudden shifts that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 89.7% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain our wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover if needed. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 85.73, allowing for a moderate hunting approach that supports sustainability. This value balances the need to hunt for reproduction while also considering the growth of the wolf population. It allows for gradual adjustments as conditions change, ensuring both species can thrive.",

A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and prevent over-depletion of the sheep, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",

This adjustment reflects the need to balance the current sheep population with the growing wolf numbers, ensuring we do not deplete the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 38.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both populations can thrive. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still enabling some hunting.",

This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly. It reflects a cautious approach to ensure both species can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.05, which is only 22.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it is crucial to prioritize the recovery of the sheep population to ensure long-term sustainability. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while focusing on reducing competition among wolves, promoting a healthier ecosystem.",
