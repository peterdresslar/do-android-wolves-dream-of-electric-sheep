            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery. Gradually increasing from my previous theta of 0.224 helps maintain a balance while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and my previous theta was low. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A gradual increase to 0.30 reflects a balanced approach that acknowledges the current state of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and while I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover slightly. A small increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 89.1% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, but the wolf population is also significant. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow for better competition among wolves while still enabling some hunting of sheep to support reproduction. This approach helps maintain a balance, ensuring both populations can thrive without depleting resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 49.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 68, which is relatively high, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight decrease in theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring that both populations can thrive without leading to a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 41.81, which is only 38.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I can afford to hunt more intensely, I should do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach that supports both wolf reproduction and sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.73, which is only 28.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight reduction from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still enabling the sheep population to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.10, which is only 22.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A moderate increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the immediate needs of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.77, which is only 18.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By adopting a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.84, which is only 15.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.43, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.85, which is only 11.7% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I also want to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach to hunting while still being cautious about the sheep"
