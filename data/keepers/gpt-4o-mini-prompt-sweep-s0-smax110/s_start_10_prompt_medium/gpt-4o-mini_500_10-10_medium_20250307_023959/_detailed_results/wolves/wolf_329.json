            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for some hunting without risking depletion. Given the wolf population is relatively high, a slight reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and allow sheep to recover while still supporting wolf reproduction.",

A slight increase in hunting intensity will help sustain our numbers while allowing the sheep to recover. This adjustment is gradual, aligning with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.73, which is only 28.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight reduction in hunting intensity allows for some recovery of the sheep population while still enabling the wolf population to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.10, which is only 22.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without risking a rapid depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.77, which is only 18.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By lowering my hunting intensity slightly, I can focus more on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.84, which is only 15.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",

A moderate approach will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling us to compete effectively with other wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",

This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to allow for some recovery while still ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach, promoting sustainability without risking a rapid depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.70, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.400 to 0.350, I can still maintain some hunting activity while prioritizing the long-term survival of both species. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.64, which is only 9.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 to 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need to compete with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting.",
