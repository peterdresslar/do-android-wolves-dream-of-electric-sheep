            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and while it is important to maintain a healthy wolf population, I need to ensure that the sheep can recover. A moderate hunting intensity allows for some reproduction among wolves while giving sheep a chance to increase their numbers. This balance is crucial for long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 29.54, which is only 26.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.40 reflects a balanced approach that supports both the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.77, which is only 21.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need to compete with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I need to ensure my pack's survival through hunting, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, ensuring both populations can thrive in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.04, which is only 14.6% of its maximum capacity. While I want to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep. A slight increase in hunting intensity will allow for some reproduction among wolves while still giving sheep a chance to recover. This moderate approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.29, which is only 13.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some reproduction among wolves while still giving sheep a chance to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without risking a rapid depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.83, which is only 11.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach that prioritizes competition among wolves while still permitting some hunting to sustain our population.",
