            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating a need for a slight reduction in their numbers to ensure sustainability. However, I want to avoid drastic changes, so a moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance while allowing for some recovery of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that we should reduce hunting intensity to allow for recovery. A moderate theta value will help maintain a balance between our needs and the sustainability of the sheep population, ensuring long-term survival for both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and while I want to maintain a healthy wolf population, I also need to ensure the sheep can recover. A moderate hunting intensity allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is close to its maximum capacity, indicating that we should be cautious with our hunting to avoid depleting their numbers too quickly. A moderate approach allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves. This small adjustment reflects the need to balance our immediate hunting needs with the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 98.67, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to maintain balance, considering the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 85.73, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 52.00, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 64.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with the wolf population at 60, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 50.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 67, I need to be cautious not to overhunt and deplete the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for more hunting while still considering the long-term balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level relative to its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A slight decrease from my previous theta will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can stabilize and grow.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.08, which is only 29.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for more hunting while still being cautious, as the wolf population is relatively high at 69.00. This adjustment aims to maintain a balance that supports both populations over the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.05, which is only 22.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for the sheep to recover. By lowering my hunting intensity slightly, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing both populations to stabilize and ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.09, which is only 18.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.98, which is only 15.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while prioritizing the sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.68, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep too quickly."
