            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 94.53, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while maintaining a sustainable balance with the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 75.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with the wolf population at 54, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 62.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 61, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for some hunting without risking depletion. Given the wolf population is also relatively high, a slight reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and support both populations",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 41.28, which is only 37.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is still room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for more hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious to avoid overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.46, which is only 29.5% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure my hunting is effective for the survival of my pack, I must also allow the sheep population to recover. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, allowing both populations to stabilize and thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.35, which is only 24.0% of its maximum capacity. While I want to ensure the survival of my pack, I also recognize the need to allow the sheep to recover. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, allowing both populations to stabilize without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.38, which is only 19.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A gradual increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, maintaining sustainability without risking a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.07, which is only 16.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for sustenance with the long-term health of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.49, which is only 14.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase to 0.40 allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.05, which is only 12.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, ensuring we do not deplete the sheep further while still competing effectively with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.79, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help sustain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover gradually. A moderate increase to 0.40 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for food with the long-term health of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.10, which is only 11.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.400 to 0.350, I can maintain a balance that focuses on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring the long-term survival of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.50, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help sustain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual increase is necessary to maintain balance and avoid sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.96, which is only 10.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing our need for food with the necessity of sustaining both populations."
