            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 200\n- Sheep population: 13.13\n- Wolf population: 46.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.350\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.29 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 11.9% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that they can sustain some hunting pressure without immediate risk of depletion. However, with a relatively high wolf population, it is wise to moderate hunting intensity to ensure our numbers remain stable and avoid overexploitation of the sheep. A gradual adjustment allows for a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at its maximum capacity, and while it is important to maintain a healthy wolf population, we must be cautious not to deplete the sheep too quickly. A moderate hunting intensity will allow for some reproduction among wolves while still giving the sheep a chance to recover and maintain their numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that a more moderate hunting intensity is necessary to allow for recovery while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 92.7% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a sustainable coexistence as I monitor the trends in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 81.7% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 50, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 75.31, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity can be slightly reduced to allow for better coexistence. This adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance while still allowing for some hunting to support the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking over-depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 41.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.66, it is essential to maintain a balanced approach to ensure the long-term survival of both species. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 31.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 70, it's important to avoid overhunting to ensure our long-term survival. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting both sheep recovery and wolf population stability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.55, which is only 24.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some reproduction among wolves while still giving sheep a chance to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.450 to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, focusing on sustainable coexistence without depleting the sheep population too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.68, which is only 18.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is some opportunity for hunting, it is crucial to avoid overexploitation to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still enabling some hunting to support our population without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.80, which is only 13.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is an opportunity to hunt, I must be cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support the wolf population while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and making gradual adjustments.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.13, which is only 11.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that considers both the need to sustain the wolf population and the recovery of the sheep."
