            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that we should be cautious with our hunting to prevent depleting their numbers. A moderate approach allows for some hunting while still enabling the sheep to recover, ensuring a sustainable balance between our populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. A lower theta allows for competition among wolves, which can help manage our numbers while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 5.24, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that they are vulnerable to overhunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves. This balance helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",

By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a healthy balance in the ecosystem. This gradual approach helps ensure long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that we should be cautious with our hunting to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the sustainability of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help sustain both populations without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still healthy at 98.67, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment reflects a balance between ensuring our wolf population thrives while allowing sheep to recover and maintain their numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 85.73, allowing for a slight decrease in hunting intensity to promote sustainability. This adjustment will help maintain a balance as the wolf population is also significant at 52.00. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can ensure the long-term survival of both species while allowing the sheep population to recover slightly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still ensuring that the sheep population can recover. A moderate increase allows for a balanced approach, avoiding sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 50.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.82, it is essential to maintain a balanced approach to ensure the long-term survival of both species. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while still enabling the wolf population to thrive.",

This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term survival for both.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 29.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 69, it is wise to focus on competition among wolves to prevent overhunting and allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.05, which is only 22.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for moderate hunting without risking the depletion of the sheep population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 allows for a more aggressive approach to hunting while still maintaining a balance that supports both wolf and sheep populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.09, which is only 18.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be increased slightly to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover.
