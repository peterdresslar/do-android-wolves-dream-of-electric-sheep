            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 50.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with the wolf population at 67, which is relatively high, I need to balance hunting intensity to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly while still ensuring the wolves can thrive. A moderate theta of 0.5 allows for sustainable coexistence and gradual adjustments as conditions change.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 38.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, it is wise to maintain a moderate approach to avoid over-depletion of sheep while still allowing for some hunting to support wolf reproduction. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 29.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 69, it is wise to focus on competition among wolves to prevent overhunting and allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.05, which is only 22.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competing with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.09, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we are competing for limited resources. A lower theta allows for a focus on competition with other wolves, which can help stabilize our population while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.98, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is 0.30, indicating a need for cautious hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.68, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to allow the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.19, which is only 12.0% of its maximum capacity. While I need to focus on hunting to ensure the survival of my pack, I must also be cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling my pack to thrive.",

A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.82, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting sheep. This will help balance the populations and prevent a crash.",

While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover.
