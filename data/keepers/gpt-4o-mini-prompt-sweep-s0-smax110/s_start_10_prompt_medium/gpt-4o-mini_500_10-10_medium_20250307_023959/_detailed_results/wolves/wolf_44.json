            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 65\n- Sheep population: 11.44\n- Wolf population: 35.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.350\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.33 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 10.4% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 89.7% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still ensuring their long-term survival. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 85.73, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity while ensuring that the sheep can recover. This adjustment reflects a balance between maintaining a healthy wolf population and allowing the sheep to thrive, avoiding sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover and maintain balance. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the trends in both populations, a gradual approach is essential to avoid over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 50.1% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity while still ensuring the sheep can recover. This balance will help sustain both populations in the long term, as the wolf population is also growing. A gradual adjustment is key to avoiding sudden crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but with the wolf population also being relatively high, a moderate hunting intensity will allow for some sheep recovery while preventing overcompetition among wolves. This balance supports long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.08, which is only 29.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.05, which is only 22.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still being mindful of the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.09, which is only 18.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I need to maintain some hunting to support wolf reproduction, I should focus more on competing with other wolves to allow the sheep population to recover. A gradual adjustment to 0.35 reflects a balanced approach, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.98, which is only 15.4% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I also want to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase in hunting intensity to 0.40 will help maintain a balance, allowing for some reproduction among wolves while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.68, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack without depleting the sheep further, promoting a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.19, which is only 12.0% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will enable me to hunt more effectively while still prioritizing the long-term balance of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.00, which is only 10.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 strikes a balance between competing with other wolves and allowing the sheep population to stabilize, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.44, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking their long-term survival. This adjustment reflects a balanced approach, considering the need to support wolf reproduction while also allowing the sheep population to recover gradually."
