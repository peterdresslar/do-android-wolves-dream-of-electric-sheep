            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that they are thriving. However, the wolf population is relatively low, and a moderate hunting intensity will help maintain our numbers without depleting the sheep too quickly. This balance allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling us to hunt effectively.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A moderate theta value will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can stabilize, promoting long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. A moderate approach will help maintain the balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term survival for both.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and while it is tempting to increase hunting intensity, a gradual approach is more sustainable. By slightly increasing theta, I can begin to take advantage of the high sheep population while still allowing for some recovery and avoiding overexploitation. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 4.58, it is crucial to focus on competition among wolves to prevent overhunting and ensure long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery. Maintaining a lower theta will help balance the wolf population and prevent overhunting, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that they are vulnerable to overhunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves to ensure our population remains stable. This approach promotes a sustainable balance between both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and a slight increase in hunting intensity will help manage their numbers while still allowing for recovery. This adjustment also considers the growing wolf population, ensuring we maintain a sustainable balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring both can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to maintain balance, as the wolf population is also significant. A gradual decrease in hunting intensity will help prevent over-depletion of the sheep and promote long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 77.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with the wolf population at 54, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while I want to ensure my pack thrives, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease from my previous theta will help balance competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sustainable coexistence as both populations are in a delicate balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 38.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without risking depletion. However, with the wolf population at 70, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.73, which is only 28.8% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A moderate increase to 0.45 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for sustainable coexistence as both populations adjust.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.10, which is only 22.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should maintain a cautious approach to hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.450 to 0.40 reflects a balanced strategy, allowing for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
