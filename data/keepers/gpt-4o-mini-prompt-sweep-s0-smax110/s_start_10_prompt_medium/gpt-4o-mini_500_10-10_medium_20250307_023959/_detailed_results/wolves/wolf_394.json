            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual approach is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a sustainable balance. This adjustment will help support the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 68, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A moderate theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still enabling the sheep population to recover and maintain balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A slight decrease from my previous theta will help maintain a balance, ensuring that both sheep and wolves can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 29.54, which is only 26.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is some opportunity for hunting, it is essential to prioritize the recovery of the sheep population to ensure long-term sustainability. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain its health.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.77, which is only 21.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.40, which is only 17.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to help sustain our population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.04, which is only 14.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves and allow for some hunting, but without depleting the sheep further. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.29, which is only 13.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.83, which is only 11.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should prioritize allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for wolf reproduction with the necessity of not depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.92, which is only 10.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting without risking depletion.

This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting strategy. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our wolf population without depleting the sheep further. This gradual adjustment helps ensure long-term survival for both species.",

This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach that supports wolf reproduction while still being cautious about the sheep population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.81, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By adopting a lower theta, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize while still ensuring that my pack remains healthy.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.77, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and maintain a sustainable balance, I will focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensifying hunting.

This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for sustainable cycles.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.48, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we are nearing a critical point for sustainable hunting. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain its health. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims to foster a balanced ecosystem.",
