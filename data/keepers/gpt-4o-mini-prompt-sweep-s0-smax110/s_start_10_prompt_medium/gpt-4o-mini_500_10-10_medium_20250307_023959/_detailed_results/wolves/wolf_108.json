            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This moderate approach helps ensure the wolf population remains healthy without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 96.04, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that can support wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep population does not decline too rapidly. This balance will help maintain the ecosystem",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is key to maintaining balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the sheep-to-wolf ratio being above 1, it is wise to maintain a moderate hunting intensity to ensure both populations can thrive without depleting resources too quickly. This adjustment allows for gradual adaptation to the ecosystem",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring long-term sustainability for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 68, it is wise to maintain a cautious approach to avoid over-depleting the sheep. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced strategy that promotes coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.95, which is only 24.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing our wolf population. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity and promote a sustainable balance, preventing overexploitation of the sheep and allowing for gradual recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.63, which is only 19.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach while still being mindful of the need to compete with other wolves as the population grows.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.77, which is only 16.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is some opportunity for hunting, it is crucial to avoid overexploitation. A moderate theta allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population and maintaining a sustainable balance with the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.47, which is only 14.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting sustainability while being mindful of the current wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.74, which is only 12.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 reflects a slight increase in hunting compared to my previous value, acknowledging the need to adapt to the current conditions without overexploiting the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.59, which is only 11.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
