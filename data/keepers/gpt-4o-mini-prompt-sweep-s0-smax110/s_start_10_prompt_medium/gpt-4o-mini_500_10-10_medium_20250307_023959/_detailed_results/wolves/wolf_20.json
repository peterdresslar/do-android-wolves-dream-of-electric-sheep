Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. This balanced approach supports the long-term survival of both species.",

This approach also helps to stabilize the wolf population as we focus on competition with other wolves, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",

A small increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring both populations can thrive.",

A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the balance between both populations.",

However, the wolf population is also significant, so I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A moderate increase to 0.45 allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves.",
