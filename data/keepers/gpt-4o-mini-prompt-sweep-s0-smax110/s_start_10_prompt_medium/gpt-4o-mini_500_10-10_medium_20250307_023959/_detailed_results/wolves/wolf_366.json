            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 412\n- Sheep population: 12.83\n- Wolf population: 42.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.400\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.31 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 11.7% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to prevent depletion. A theta of 0.60 allows for a balanced approach, ensuring that both the sheep and wolf populations can sustain themselves while still allowing for some hunting to support wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that a slight reduction in hunting intensity is necessary to allow for recovery while still maintaining a sustainable balance. This moderate approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently healthy at 101.90, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment reflects a moderate approach, ensuring the wolf population can thrive without depleting the sheep too quickly. It allows for sustainable coexistence as we adapt to the current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 82.4% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity. This will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations while avoiding overhunting. Additionally, with the wolf population at 49, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the growth of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring the sheep can recover and thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the wolf population is relatively high. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to thrive. This approach maintains a balance and avoids depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly. It reflects a cautious approach to ensure both species can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 29.54, which is only 26.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more conservative approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while maintaining a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.77, which is only 21.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.40, which is only 17.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for moderate hunting without risking depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for sustainable hunting while still being cautious about the overall balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.04, which is only 14.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is some opportunity for hunting, I need to be cautious and avoid overexploitation. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, enabling the sheep to recover while still ensuring the wolf population remains healthy.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.29, which is only 13.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some recovery of the sheep while still ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.83, which is only 11.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring both populations can thrive in the long term."
