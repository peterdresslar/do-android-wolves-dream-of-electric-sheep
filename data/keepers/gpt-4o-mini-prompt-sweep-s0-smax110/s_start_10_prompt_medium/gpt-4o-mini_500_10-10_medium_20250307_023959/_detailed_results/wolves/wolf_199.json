            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 193\n- Sheep population: 59.91\n- Wolf population: 65.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.919\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.92 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 54.5% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 41.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a more balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 31.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 70, which is relatively high, I need to balance hunting intensity to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A moderate theta of 0.60 allows for continued reproduction of wolves while ensuring that the sheep population can recover.",

While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the balance needed for long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.33, which is only 15.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing competition among wolves, which will help stabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.80, which is only 13.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase to 0.40 allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still being mindful of the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance while still considering the need for wolves to thrive.",

This indicates that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still being cautious about the sheep population",

To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable balance, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting. This lower theta will help maintain the sheep population while also allowing for gradual adjustments in the future as conditions change.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.54, which is only 9.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be slightly increased to support wolf reproduction, it is crucial to avoid overhunting to allow the sheep population to recover. A small increase to 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for wolf survival with the sustainability of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.37, which is only 9.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is a need for cautious hunting to allow the sheep to recover. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.41, I can afford to slightly increase my hunting intensity to ensure the wolf population remains healthy without depleting the sheep too quickly. A gradual increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.35, which is only 9.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting a lower theta, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize while avoiding overhunting. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",

This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.30 to 0.35, I can still maintain some hunting activity while prioritizing the long-term balance between our populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.04, which is only 10.0% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly.
