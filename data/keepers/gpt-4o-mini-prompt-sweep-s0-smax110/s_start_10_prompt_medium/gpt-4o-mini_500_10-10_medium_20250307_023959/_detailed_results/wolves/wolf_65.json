            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 64.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with the wolf population at 60, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 50.1% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, as it allows for sustainable coexistence while also considering the growth of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 38.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. With a wolf population of 69, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is relatively low, suggesting that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a presence in the ecosystem. A theta of 0.35 allows for a moderate approach, balancing competition with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can stabilize and grow.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.08, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderate to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring both populations can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.05, which is only 22.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 allows for a more balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.09, which is only 18.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to allow the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack without depleting the sheep further, promoting a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.98, which is only 15.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some reproduction among wolves while still giving sheep a chance to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting sustainability without risking a rapid depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.68, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for wolf reproduction with the sustainability of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.19, which is only 12.0% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, a slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted to help stabilize the sheep population without depleting it too quickly. This moderate adjustment allows for a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta value will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can grow, which is essential for the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.44, which is only 10.4% of its maximum capacity. With the wolf population at 35.00, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low, indicating that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species and avoid depleting the sheep population further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.03, which is only 10% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for the sheep to recover, and a slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance without depleting their numbers too quickly. By adjusting theta to 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, promoting a sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.82, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can help the sheep population stabilize while also managing competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.77, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. While I need to be cautious about overhunting, a slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a gradual adjustment to support my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.90, which is only 9.9% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting intensively. This will help maintain the balance and prevent a crash in both populations.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low at 11.49, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a balance as the sheep population recovers while also considering the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.86, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a potential strain on resources. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while still competing with other wolves. This moderate approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.36, which is only 11.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need to adapt to the changing conditions."
