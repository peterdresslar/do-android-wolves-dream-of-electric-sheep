            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and a slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep too quickly. This moderate adjustment allows for sustainable coexistence while also considering the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 105.01, and I want to gradually increase my hunting intensity to ensure the wolf population can thrive. However, I must be cautious and avoid overhunting, as the sheep are close to their maximum capacity. A small increase from my previous theta allows for sustainable coexistence while still focusing on the needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 87.3% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can continue to thrive. A gradual adjustment is key to maintaining balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 84.57, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the sheep-to-wolf ratio at 1.60, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This approach balances the needs of both populations and avoids sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 51.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 66.00, it is important to avoid overhunting to ensure both species can thrive. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow sheep to recover while still enabling wolves to maintain their population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 31.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.51, I need to focus on maintaining a balance that allows both populations to thrive. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help the sheep recover while still allowing for some hunting to support the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.95, which is only 24.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.63, which is only 19.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By maintaining a moderate theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I need to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.47, which is only 14.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, reducing the risk of depleting the sheep further while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.74, which is only 12.5% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking the depletion of the sheep population. A moderate increase to 0.40 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for wolf reproduction with the sustainability of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.59, which is only 11.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while prioritizing the long-term balance."
