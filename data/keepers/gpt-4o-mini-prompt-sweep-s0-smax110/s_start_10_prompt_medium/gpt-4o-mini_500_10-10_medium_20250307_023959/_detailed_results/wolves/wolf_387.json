            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 82.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.85, it is essential to maintain a balance that allows for sustainable coexistence. A slight increase in theta to 0.35 reflects a cautious approach to hunting, allowing for some reproduction among wolves while still enabling the sheep population to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sustainable coexistence. A gradual increase is prudent to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With the wolf population at 68, which is relatively high, I need to focus on maintaining a balance. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still ensuring that the wolf population remains healthy.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term survival for both.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 29.54, which is only 26.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.40 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population and maintaining a balance with the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.77, which is only 21.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is some room for increased hunting, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 allows for a balanced approach that supports wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.40, which is only 17.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should maintain a moderate hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while still ensuring that our wolf population remains healthy. A slight decrease from my previous theta of 0.45 will help balance our needs with the sustainability of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.04, which is only 14.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing on competition among wolves while still allowing for some hunting to ensure our population remains healthy without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.29, which is only 13.0% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking the depletion of the sheep population. A gradual increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for some growth in the wolf population while still being mindful of the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.83, which is only 11.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of both populations, ensuring that we do not deplete the sheep further and can maintain a healthy wolf population in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.92, which is only 10.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.31, which is only 10.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack while also prioritizing the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.94, which is only 9.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are under pressure, and focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while allowing the sheep population to stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.81, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should be cautious with our hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will help maintain a balance between hunting and allowing the sheep population to stabilize, while also considering the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.77, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting sheep. This will help balance the populations and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.95, which is only 10.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some recovery of the sheep while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without risking depletion of the sheep."
