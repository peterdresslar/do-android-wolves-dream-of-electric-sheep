With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 6.88, it is crucial to avoid overhunting, which could lead to a decline in sheep numbers and ultimately harm the wolf population as well. Maintaining a steady approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",

This will help sustain our wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover if needed. A gradual adjustment is key to maintaining balance.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.73, which is only 28.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is potential for recovery if I maintain a moderate hunting intensity. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.40 to 0.45, I can balance the need for hunting to support the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
