            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 51\n- Sheep population: 109.55\n- Wolf population: 31.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.029\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 3.53 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 99.6% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and my previous low theta indicates a focus on competition with other wolves. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to gradually increase my hunting intensity while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A theta of 0.25 strikes a balance between hunting and competition, promoting sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring both can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 98.67, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, the wolf population is also significant at 43, so I need to be cautious not to overhunt and risk depleting the sheep. A gradual increase to 0.40 allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 85.73, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 64.5% of its maximum capacity, which indicates that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with a wolf population of 60, it is wise to maintain a slightly lower hunting intensity to allow for the recovery of both sheep and wolves. This gradual adjustment will help ensure long-term coexistence and prevent overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing sheep to recover. It reflects a balanced approach to ensure long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 38.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.61, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.08, which is only 29.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for more hunting to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious to avoid overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.05, which is only 22.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that the sheep need time to recover, and a lower hunting intensity will allow for their population to stabilize. Additionally, with a wolf population of 66, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.09, which is only 18.3% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still being cautious. A theta of 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, enabling me to hunt more effectively without depleting the sheep population too quickly, thus ensuring long-term survival for both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.98, which is only 15.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking a rapid depletion of the sheep, ensuring a more sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.68, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to help sustain the wolf population while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep too quickly. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.35 aligns with the wisdom of making small adjustments based on current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.19, which is only 12.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.00, which is only 10.9% of its maximum capacity. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover while also addressing the competition among wolves. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both populations."
