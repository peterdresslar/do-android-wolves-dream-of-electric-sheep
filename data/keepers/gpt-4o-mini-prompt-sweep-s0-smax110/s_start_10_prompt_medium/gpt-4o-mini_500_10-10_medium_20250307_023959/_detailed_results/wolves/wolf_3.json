            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 0\n- Sheep population: 10.00\n- Wolf population: 10.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.500\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 1.00 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 9.1% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.00, which is only 9.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.40 strikes a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.54, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate increase will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. It aligns with the wisdom of making gradual adjustments based on current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.15, which is only 10.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 will help balance our needs with the sustainability of the ecosystem, ensuring that both wolves and sheep can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.84, which is only 10.8% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A gradual increase helps maintain balance and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.64, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term sustainability while allowing for gradual recovery of both species."
