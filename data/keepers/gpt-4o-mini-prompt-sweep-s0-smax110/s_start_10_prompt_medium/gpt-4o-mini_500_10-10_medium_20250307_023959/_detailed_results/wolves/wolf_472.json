            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 30.28, which is only 27.5% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, allowing for sustainable coexistence without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.35, which is only 22.1% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.40 will help maintain balance and avoid sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.57, which is only 17.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack without depleting the sheep further, promoting a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.00, which is only 15.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the immediate needs of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.63, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should be cautious with our hunting to allow the sheep to recover. However, with a moderate wolf population of 49, a slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted to ensure our pack can thrive without depleting the sheep too quickly. A theta of 0.45 strikes a balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep sustainably.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.91, which is only 11.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This gradual adjustment helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.92, which is only 10.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.20, which is only 10.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta value of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both populations. It also reflects a cautious approach as the wolf population is relatively high at 34.00, indicating a need to balance competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.75, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.61, which is only 9.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population and maintaining a balance with the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.50, which is only 9.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for gradual adjustments.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.52, which is only 9.6% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population, a moderate approach is necessary. This theta value allows for some hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of both species.",

This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable, and while I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must prioritize the recovery of the sheep. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to stabilize while still enabling some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I need to increase my hunting intensity to ensure the survival of my pack, I must do so gradually to avoid depleting the sheep population too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a more sustainable approach while still considering the current wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.82, which is only 10.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I want to maintain a healthy wolf population, I also need to allow the sheep to recover. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will help ensure that both populations can stabilize and thrive over time.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.96, which is only 11.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to help sustain wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach, ensuring that I do not over-deplete the sheep while still focusing on maintaining a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.63, which is only 12.4% of its maximum capacity. While I want to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must prioritize the recovery of the sheep. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting for sustenance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.44, which is only 13.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is an opportunity to hunt, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a more balanced approach, encouraging sustainable coexistence while still enabling some hunting to support the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.34, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. While I want to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, allowing both populations to stabilize without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.38, which is only 14.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I can increase my hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate increase to 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of the wolf population."
