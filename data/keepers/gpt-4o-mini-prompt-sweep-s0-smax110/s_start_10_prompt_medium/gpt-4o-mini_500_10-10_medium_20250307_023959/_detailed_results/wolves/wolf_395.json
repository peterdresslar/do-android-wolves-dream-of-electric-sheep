            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 403\n- Sheep population: 76.40\n- Wolf population: 58.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.184\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 1.32 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 69.5% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 69.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep. However, my previous theta was quite low, and I need to gradually increase my hunting intensity to ensure the wolf population remains sustainable. A theta of 0.25 allows for a slight increase in hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of sheep and avoiding overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 55.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population slightly higher than the sheep population, a moderate approach will help maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly while allowing for some hunting to support wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but still below maximum capacity. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain our population while allowing for some recovery in the sheep numbers. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining balance and responding to current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 37.76, which is only 34.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a more balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to overhunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 26.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 67.00, a moderate approach is necessary to prevent overhunting and allow both populations to stabilize. This theta value reflects a cautious strategy that balances hunting with the need to compete with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.77, which is only 21.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A moderate increase from my previous theta of 0.400 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.40, which is only 17.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to allow for recovery. A moderate theta of 0.35 balances the need for hunting with the necessity of allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow, ensuring long-term sustainability for both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.04, which is only 14.6% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, ensuring both populations can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.29, which is only 13.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing our own population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack without depleting the sheep further, promoting a more balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.83, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a balance as the wolf population is relatively high, and a moderate increase in hunting can support our reproduction while still allowing the sheep to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.92, which is only 10.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.31, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking their long-term survival. This adjustment helps maintain a balance as the sheep population is only at 10.3% of its maximum capacity. A gradual increase in theta will support wolf reproduction while still allowing for the sheep to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.94, which is only 9.9% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable balance, I will slightly reduce my hunting intensity while still competing with other wolves. This approach will help maintain the wolf population without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low at 9.8% of maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a scarcity of prey. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a bit more hunting to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep further. This approach maintains a balance that can help both populations recover over time.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.77, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta value of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both populations. It also accounts for the growing wolf population, which suggests a need to balance competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.95, which is only 10.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.18, which is only 10.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that considers both the need for wolves to thrive and the necessity of maintaining a sustainable sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.48, and the wolf population is relatively high at 15.00. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover.
