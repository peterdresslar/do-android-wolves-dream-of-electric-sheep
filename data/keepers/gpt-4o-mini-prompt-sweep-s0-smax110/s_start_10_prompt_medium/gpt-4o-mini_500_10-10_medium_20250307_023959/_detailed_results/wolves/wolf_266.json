This adjustment allows for continued reproduction among wolves while ensuring that the sheep population does not decline too rapidly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 48.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 67, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to prevent future crashes. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance while allowing both populations to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term survival for both. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need to avoid over-depletion of the sheep, a slight reduction from my previous theta will help adapt to the growing wolf population while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.46, which is only 29.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still giving sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.35, which is only 24.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it is crucial to avoid overexploitation. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population and maintaining a balance with the growing wolf population.",

A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.49, which is only 14.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, promoting a sustainable balance between both populations.",

A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.50, which is only 10.5% of its maximum capacity.

This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A moderate theta value of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack while prioritizing the long-term balance of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.88, which is only 9.9% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover.

This suggests that we need to allow the sheep to recover while also ensuring that our wolf population remains healthy. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, focusing on sustainable coexistence while still enabling some hunting to support our reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.38, which is only 10.3% of its maximum capacity.

A moderate increase to 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for sustainable cycles.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I want to ensure my pack thrives, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, preventing over-exploitation of the sheep while still allowing for some hunting to support wolf reproduction.",

A moderate theta allows for some hunting while also giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring a sustainable balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.69, which is only 11.5% of its maximum capacity.

A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.35 helps maintain balance and allows for sustainable coexistence.",
