This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.35, which is only 24.0% of its maximum capacity.
