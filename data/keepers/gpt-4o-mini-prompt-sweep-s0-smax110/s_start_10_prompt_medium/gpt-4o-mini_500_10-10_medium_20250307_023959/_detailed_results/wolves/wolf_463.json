            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 475\n- Sheep population: 67.02\n- Wolf population: 63.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.345\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 1.06 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 60.9% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population remains sustainable.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 47.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, it is wise to maintain a moderate hunting intensity to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly while still allowing for some reproduction among the wolves. This small increase from my previous theta allows for a gradual adjustment to the current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but with the wolf population also being relatively high, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 30.28, which is only 27.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, ensuring that we do not deplete the sheep further while still competing effectively with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.35, which is only 22.1% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking immediate depletion of the sheep. A moderate increase to 0.40 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for wolf reproduction with the sustainability of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.57, which is only 17.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is some room for hunting, it is crucial to maintain a balance to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while also focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.00, which is only 15.5% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. This lower theta will help maintain a balance and prevent overexploitation of the sheep, while also considering the current high wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.63, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for the sheep to recover, and a slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain our wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A moderate adjustment allows for a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves.",

This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly, as I need to be mindful of the growing wolf population.",

This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach that can support wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.75, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to stabilize while still competing with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.61, which is only 9.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is an opportunity to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A small increase to 0.40 maintains a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.50, which is only 9.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This approach promotes long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.52, which is only 9.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should be cautious with our hunting to allow the sheep to recover. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.50, there is still a need to maintain some hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A slight increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing our immediate needs.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.69, which is only 9.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 will help balance the needs of both wolves and sheep, ensuring long-term survival while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.99, which is only 10.0% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still being cautious. A moderate increase to 0.40 will help maintain a balance, allowing for some reproduction among wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover without depleting their numbers too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.39, which is only 10.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without risking depletion.
