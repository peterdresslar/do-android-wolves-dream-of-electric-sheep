            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 412\n- Sheep population: 12.83\n- Wolf population: 42.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.400\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.31 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 11.7% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and while I need to maintain a healthy wolf population, I must also ensure that I do not deplete the sheep too quickly. A moderate decrease from my previous theta allows for sustainable hunting while still enabling reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term survival for both.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 101.90, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This adjustment reflects a balance between competing with other wolves and maintaining a sustainable sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 82.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep. However, the wolf population is also significant at 49, suggesting that a slight reduction in hunting intensity is prudent to allow for sustainable coexistence. By adjusting theta to 0.55, I can maintain a balance that supports both populations without risking depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while I want to maintain a healthy wolf population, I also recognize the importance of allowing the sheep to recover. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will help balance the needs of both species while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while I want to increase hunting to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep too quickly. A moderate increase allows for a balance that can support both populations without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. With a wolf population of 68, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is low, suggesting that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a presence in the ecosystem. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing competition among wolves, which will help stabilize both populations over time.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 37.76, which is only 34.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I need to maintain some hunting to support the wolf population, I should be cautious not to overhunt and risk depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting sustainability while still considering the current dynamics.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 29.54, which is only 26.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.77, which is only 21.6% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting sheep. This will allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a healthy balance in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.40, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery. A gradual increase helps maintain balance and avoids sudden population crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.04, which is only 14.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach that balances our need for sustenance with the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.29, which is only 13.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain our wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing our immediate needs.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.83, which is only 11.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is some opportunity for hunting, it is crucial to maintain a balance to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both populations."
