To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover. This lower theta will help balance the ecosystem and prevent overexploitation of the sheep.",

A moderate increase allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling the wolf population to thrive.",

This adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, promoting sustainability while also considering the growth of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.77, which is only 21.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is some opportunity for hunting, it is crucial to be cautious and avoid overexploitation. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that supports both wolf reproduction and sheep recovery.",
