            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 414\n- Sheep population: 11.31\n- Wolf population: 33.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.400\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.34 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 10.3% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 82.4% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. However, I must remain cautious as the wolf population is also significant. A theta of 0.72 strikes a balance between ensuring my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity while still ensuring the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep. This adjustment reflects the need to balance our hunting with the growing wolf population, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that can support wolf reproduction while preventing over-depletion of the sheep. This balance will help maintain both populations in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring both populations can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A theta of 0.45 strikes a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can stabilize, promoting long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 29.54, which is only 26.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By lowering my hunting intensity slightly, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some sustainable hunting. This will help maintain a balance between the wolf and sheep populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.77, which is only 21.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the long-term health of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.40, which is only 17.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without risking the sheep population too much. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach that encourages both wolf growth and sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.04, which is only 14.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from the previous theta of 0.450 to 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring sustainability in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.29, which is only 13.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach that considers both the immediate need for food and the long-term health of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.83, which is only 11.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover while also considering the growing wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while prioritizing the long-term balance of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.92, which is only 10.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is potential for recovery in the sheep population. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity to 0.40, I can still focus on maintaining a balance while allowing the sheep to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of adapting to changing conditions without risking a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we are nearing a critical point for sustainability. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling us to compete with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in our ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.94, which is only 9.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability."
