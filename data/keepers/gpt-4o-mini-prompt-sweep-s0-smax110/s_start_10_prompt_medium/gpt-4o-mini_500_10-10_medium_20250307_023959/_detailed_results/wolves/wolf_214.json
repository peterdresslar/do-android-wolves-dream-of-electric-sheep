Maintaining a focus on competition with other wolves will help stabilize our population while ensuring the sheep can bounce back in the future.",

A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",

However, with the wolf population also present, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A gradual increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach that supports both wolf reproduction and sheep recovery.",

This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly. A gradual increase is wise to ensure sustainability.",

This adjustment allows for a slight increase in hunting while still focusing on the competition with other wolves, which is necessary as the wolf population is growing. This balance will help maintain both populations over time.",

This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population. A moderate theta value will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.46, which is only 29.5% of its maximum capacity.

This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly.
