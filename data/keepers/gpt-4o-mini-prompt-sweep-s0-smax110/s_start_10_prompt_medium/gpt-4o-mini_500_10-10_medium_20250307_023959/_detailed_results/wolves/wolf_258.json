However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.53, it is important to focus on competition among wolves to prevent overhunting and allow the sheep population to recover. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.135 to 0.25 reflects a cautious approach to ensure both populations can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 62.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population also being relatively high, a moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep too quickly. This gradual adjustment allows for coexistence while ensuring the wolves can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support the wolf population while still considering the need for sheep recovery. A gradual increase is essential to avoid over-depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 41.28, which is only 37.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is some room for hunting, I need to be cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population and maintaining a balance with the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.46, which is only 29.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to allow for some recovery while still ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.35, which is only 24.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is potential for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a more aggressive approach to hunting, which can help support wolf reproduction while still being mindful of the need to maintain a balance. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of responding to population trends.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.38, which is only 19.4% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity slightly while allowing the sheep to recover. This moderate approach will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem without depleting the sheep further.",

This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking the depletion of the sheep population. A gradual increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for sustainable coexistence while still considering the need for wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.49, which is only 14.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack without depleting the sheep further, promoting a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.05, which is only 12.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase to 0.40 allows for more hunting while still considering the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.79, which is only 11.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.4 to 0.35, I can maintain a focus on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",

This suggests that we should be cautious with our hunting to allow the sheep to recover. However, with a moderate wolf population of 31, a slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted to ensure our pack",
