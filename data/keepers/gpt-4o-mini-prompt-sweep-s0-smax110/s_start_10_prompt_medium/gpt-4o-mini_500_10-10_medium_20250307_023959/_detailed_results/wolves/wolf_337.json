However, with the wolf population at 70, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to prevent a decline in the sheep population. A moderate increase in hunting intensity allows for a balance that supports both wolf reproduction and sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.73, which is only 28.8% of its maximum capacity. While I want to maintain a healthy wolf population, I also recognize the need to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.55 strikes a balance between hunting and allowing the sheep population to stabilize, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.10, which is only 22.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.77, which is only 18.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach that balances our need for sustenance with the necessity of ensuring the sheep population can rebound, thus supporting long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.84, which is only 15.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support our wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting sustainable coexistence while still addressing the needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.43, which is only 13.1% of its maximum capacity.

This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover.
