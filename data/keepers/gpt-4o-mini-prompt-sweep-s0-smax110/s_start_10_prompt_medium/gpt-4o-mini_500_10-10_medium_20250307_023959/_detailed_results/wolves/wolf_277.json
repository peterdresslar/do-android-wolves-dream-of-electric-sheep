A moderate approach allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some hunting to support the wolf population. This balance helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively small. Focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to recover and maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem. This gradual approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
