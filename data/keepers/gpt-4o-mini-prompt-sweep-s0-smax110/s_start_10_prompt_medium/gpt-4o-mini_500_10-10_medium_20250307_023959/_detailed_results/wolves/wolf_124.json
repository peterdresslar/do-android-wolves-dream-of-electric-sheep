            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 84.57, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 53.00, I need to be cautious not to overhunt and risk depleting the sheep too quickly. A theta of 0.68 strikes a balance between sustaining our pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for moderate hunting that supports wolf reproduction while preventing over-depletion of the sheep. This balance will help maintain both populations in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 51.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 66, which is relatively high compared to the sheep, a moderate approach will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep too quickly. This theta allows for a gradual increase in hunting intensity while still considering the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. Given the current wolf population, a slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and allow both populations to thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population also being relatively high, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A gradual increase to 0.45 allows for continued reproduction while maintaining a balance that prevents depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.95, which is only 24.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some sustainable hunting. This will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem and ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.63, which is only 19.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.77, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a need for caution in hunting. A moderate approach allows for some hunting while giving the sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.47, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a need for caution. While I want to increase hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must also ensure that the sheep population has room to recover. A slight increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.74, which is only 12.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need to compete with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to support our population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.59, which is only 11.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.76, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring both populations can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I need to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.91, which is only 9.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover rather than intensifying our hunting. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both populations while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.79, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting. This will help maintain the balance and prevent a further decline in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.84, which is only 9.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that the sheep are under pressure, and while I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.02, which is only 10% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking immediate depletion of the sheep. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance as the sheep population recovers, while also considering the growing wolf population."
