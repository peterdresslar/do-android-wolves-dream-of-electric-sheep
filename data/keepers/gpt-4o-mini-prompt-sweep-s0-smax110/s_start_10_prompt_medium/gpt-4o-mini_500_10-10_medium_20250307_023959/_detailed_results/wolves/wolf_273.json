            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep do not become over-depleted. A gradual approach is essential to avoid sudden crashes in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 29.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 68, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.35, which is only 24.0% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I also want to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.55 strikes a balance between hunting enough to support wolf reproduction while not over-depleting the sheep, allowing for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.38, which is only 19.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while we can increase our hunting intensity, we should do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for some hunting to support our wolf population while still giving the sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.07, which is only 16.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.450 to 0.35, I can still maintain some hunting activity while prioritizing the long-term balance and sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.49, which is only 14.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.05, which is only 12.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to allow for recovery. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while also prioritizing the competition among wolves, ensuring that we do not deplete the sheep population too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.79, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can recover over time.",
