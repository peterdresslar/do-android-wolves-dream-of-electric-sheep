This gradual adjustment allows for sustainable coexistence while also supporting the wolf population.",

This adjustment helps maintain a balance between wolf competition and sheep availability, promoting long-term sustainability.",

With the sheep-to-wolf ratio being slightly above 1, it is wise to maintain a moderate hunting intensity to ensure the sheep can recover while also supporting the wolf population. This adjustment allows for gradual adaptation to changing conditions without risking a sudden decline in either population.",

This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of gradual changes to ensure sustainability.",

A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help balance the ecosystem and prevent over-depletion of sheep, while still allowing for some hunting to support wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 30.28, which is only 27.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring both populations can recover sustainably.",
