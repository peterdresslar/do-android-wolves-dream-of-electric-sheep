            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 269\n- Sheep population: 14.05\n- Wolf population: 44.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.350\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.32 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 12.8% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and a slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep too quickly. This adjustment allows for a gradual response to the current conditions while still prioritizing the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 94.2% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 2.66, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 94.53, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction. However, I must remain cautious as the wolf population is also significant at 46.00. A moderate increase to 0.45 allows for sustainable coexistence while still addressing the needs of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 75.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 54, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for some hunting without risking depletion. With the wolf population also being significant, a slight reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and allow for recovery of both populations. This approach aligns with the wisdom of making gradual adjustments to ensure long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 41.28, which is only 37.5% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.400 helps maintain balance and allows for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.46, which is only 29.5% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, allowing both populations to stabilize without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.35, which is only 24.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is some room for hunting, I need to be cautious as the wolf population is relatively high at 64.00. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain a healthy population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of making gradual adjustments to ensure long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.38, which is only 19.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without risking depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach to hunting while still considering the need for the sheep population to recover. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.07, which is only 16.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.49, which is only 14.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a presence in the hunting cycle. A moderate theta of 0.35 will help balance our competition with other wolves and ensure that we do not deplete the sheep population further, promoting long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.05, which is only 12.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for a slight increase in hunting intensity to help sustain wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A gradual increase to 0.40 strikes a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep can bounce back."
