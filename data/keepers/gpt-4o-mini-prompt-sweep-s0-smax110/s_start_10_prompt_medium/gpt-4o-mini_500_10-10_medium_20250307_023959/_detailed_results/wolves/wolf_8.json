This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.40 allows for some hunting while prioritizing competition with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.54, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring both populations can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.15, which is only 10.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for the sheep to recover, and a lower hunting intensity will allow for sustainable coexistence. By slightly decreasing my hunting intensity from 0.45 to 0.40, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing the sheep population to grow, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.84, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.64, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we need to be cautious with our hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a more balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still maintaining some hunting to support our population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.49, which is only 12.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need to adapt to the current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and while it is important to maintain a healthy wolf population, I need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to stabilize and grow, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.57, which is only 14.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level relative to its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both sheep and wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain the balance between wolf and sheep populations while avoiding overexploitation. A gradual increase is prudent as it supports our long-term survival and allows for the sheep to recover if needed.",

This will help support wolf reproduction while still maintaining a balance that prevents over-depletion of the sheep. A gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of my ancestors, ensuring both populations can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 24.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 9.04, it is wise to maintain a moderate hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while still ensuring the wolf population remains healthy.
