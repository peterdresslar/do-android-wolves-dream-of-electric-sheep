            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 94.4% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. A moderate theta of 0.60 will enable me to maintain a sustainable coexistence while still allowing for some hunting to support the wolf population. This adjustment considers the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and aims to prevent over-depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 85.4% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain our wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while it is beneficial to maintain some hunting to support wolf reproduction, I want to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A moderate approach allows for coexistence while also considering the gradual increase in wolf numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while it is beneficial to increase hunting intensity as the sheep population grows, I must also consider the current wolf population. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.06, it indicates a slight competition among wolves. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition, ensuring both populations can thrive without depleting resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover gradually.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must also consider the growing wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that promotes coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 30.28, which is only 27.5% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A gradual increase is essential to maintain balance and ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.35, which is only 22.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is some room for hunting, it is essential to maintain a balance to allow for recovery. A slight decrease from my previous theta of 0.450 will help ensure that we do not deplete the sheep too quickly while still allowing for some hunting to support our wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.57, which is only 17.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing competition with other wolves, which will help stabilize our numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.00, which is only 15.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.63, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on the competition with other wolves, ensuring a balanced approach for long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.91, which is only 11.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.92, which is only 10.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be slightly increased to support wolf reproduction, it is crucial to avoid overhunting to allow the sheep population to recover. A gradual increase to 0.35 reflects a balanced approach, considering both the need for wolves to thrive and the necessity of maintaining a sustainable sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.20, which is only 10.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach that acknowledges the need for wolves to thrive while still being mindful of the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.75, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensifying hunting. A slight decrease from my previous theta will help maintain a balance that supports both populations in the long run."
