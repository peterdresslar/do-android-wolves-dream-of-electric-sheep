            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity can be increased moderately to ensure the wolf population remains healthy. However, I must be cautious not to overhunt, as this could lead to a depletion of sheep and destabilize the ecosystem. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for sustainable hunting while still considering the long-term balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that we should reduce hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help balance our competition with other wolves while ensuring the sheep population can stabilize and grow again.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. With a high sheep-to-wolf ratio and a growing wolf population, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution in hunting to prevent depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the sustainability of both populations. This approach helps maintain a balance as I monitor the trends in both sheep and wolf numbers.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that they are vulnerable to overhunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of sheep and maintaining a balance with the wolf population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments to ensure long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and a slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain the balance without depleting the sheep too quickly. This adjustment allows for sustainable coexistence while also supporting the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 89.7% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a sustainable coexistence as the wolf population grows.",

A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still providing enough resources for the wolves. This approach aligns with maintaining a balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sustainable coexistence.",

However, with the wolf population at 69, it is important to avoid overhunting to ensure sustainability. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.08, which is only 29.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach that supports wolf reproduction while still being cautious about the sheep population",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.09, which is only 18.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for increased hunting intensity to help sustain the wolf population. However, since the wolf population is relatively high at 62, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A moderate increase to 0.45 allows for a balanced approach that supports both populations without risking a crash.",
