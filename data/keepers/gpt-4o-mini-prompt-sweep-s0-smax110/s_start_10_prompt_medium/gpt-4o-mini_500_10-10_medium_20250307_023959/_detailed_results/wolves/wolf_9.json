This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.40 strikes a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can stabilize and grow, promoting long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.54, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking over-depletion. This moderate adjustment will help sustain both the wolf and sheep populations while allowing for gradual recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.15, which is only 10.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a more balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still enabling some hunting to support our population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.84, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between ensuring wolf reproduction and allowing the sheep population to recover.",

This approach aligns with my goal of ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
