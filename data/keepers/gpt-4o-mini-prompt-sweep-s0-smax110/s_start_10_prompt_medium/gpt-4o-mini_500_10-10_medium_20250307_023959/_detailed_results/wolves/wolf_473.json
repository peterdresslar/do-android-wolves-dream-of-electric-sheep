            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting approach. This will help maintain the balance between wolves and sheep while ensuring that the wolf population does not grow too rapidly. A gradual increase in hunting intensity is warranted as the sheep population is still below maximum capacity, but I want to avoid overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 30.28, which is only 27.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it is crucial to prioritize the recovery of the sheep population to ensure long-term sustainability. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, helping to balance both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.35, which is only 22.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach that supports both wolf reproduction and sheep recovery, while still being cautious of the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.57, which is only 17.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring a balance that supports both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.00, which is only 15.5% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.63, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a slight hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A small increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach that encourages coexistence without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.91, which is only 11.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",

This indicates that we need to allow the sheep to recover while also considering the growing wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack without depleting the sheep further, promoting a healthier balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.20, which is only 10.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase to 0.40 allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.75, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still competing with other wolves. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance and prevent over-depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.61, which is only 9.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for gradual hunting to help sustain wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.50, which is only 9.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of both populations, ensuring that we do not deplete the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.52, which is only 9.6% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between hunting and allowing the sheep population to stabilize, avoiding over-depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.69, which is only 9.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack without depleting the sheep further, promoting a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.99, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a balance as the sheep population recovers while also considering the growing wolf population. A gradual increase in theta will support sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.39, which is only 10.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting sustainability while still being mindful of the wolf population growth.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.34, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking over-depletion. This moderate adjustment helps maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can recover. It aligns with the wisdom of making gradual changes in response to current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.96, which is only 11.8% of its maximum capacity. While I want to ensure the wolves can reproduce, I also need to allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and prevent over-depletion of the sheep, allowing for a more sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.63, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. However, with the wolf population at 9.00, it",

While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, allowing both populations to stabilize without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.34, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still being mindful of the sheep population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.38, which is only 14.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight decrease in hunting intensity allows for some recovery of the sheep population while still enabling the wolf population to thrive."
