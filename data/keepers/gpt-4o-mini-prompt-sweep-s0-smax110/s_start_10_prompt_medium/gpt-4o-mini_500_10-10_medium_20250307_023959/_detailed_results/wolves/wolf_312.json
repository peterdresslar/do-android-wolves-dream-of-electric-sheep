            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 89.1% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 46, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must also consider the potential for overhunting. A moderate approach allows for coexistence while still enabling some growth in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 49.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. Given the current wolf population, a slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow for better competition among wolves while still enabling some hunting to support reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 41.81, which is only 38.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased slightly to support wolf reproduction, it is crucial to avoid overhunting to allow the sheep population to recover. A moderate increase to 0.45 reflects a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.73, which is only 28.8% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, allowing for sustainable coexistence without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that considers both the current sheep population and the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.77, which is only 18.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is some opportunity for hunting, it is crucial to allow the sheep to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.84, which is only 15.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. By increasing theta slightly from 0.35 to 0.40, I can enhance hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.43, which is only 13.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on the competition among wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.85, which is only 11.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without over-depleting the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.70, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from the previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35, I can maintain a balance that supports the wolf population while giving sheep a chance to rebound.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.15, which is only 10.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I need to be cautious about overhunting, a slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted to ensure the wolf population can sustain itself. A theta of 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the immediate needs of the wolf pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.64, which is only 9.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 reflects a balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain wolf health."
