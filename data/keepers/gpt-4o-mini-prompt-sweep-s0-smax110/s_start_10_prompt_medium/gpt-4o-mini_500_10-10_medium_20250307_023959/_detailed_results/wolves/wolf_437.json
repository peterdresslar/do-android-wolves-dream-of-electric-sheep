            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 484\n- Sheep population: 11.92\n- Wolf population: 39.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.400\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.31 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 10.8% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3. Adjust your hunting intensity gradually in response to population changes\n4. Find a balance that creates sustainable cycles rather than crashes\n5.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and while I want to maintain a healthy wolf population, I also need to ensure that the sheep can recover. A moderate theta allows for balanced hunting while still considering the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 103.80, which allows for a moderate hunting intensity that can sustain both the wolf and sheep populations. This adjustment maintains a balance, allowing for some hunting while also considering the potential growth of the sheep population. It reflects a cautious approach to ensure long-term survival and avoids depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 93.97, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are enough sheep to sustain hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring that both populations can thrive while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help sustain our wolf population while still allowing sheep to recover. A gradual increase is necessary to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we can maintain a balance without overhunting. A slight reduction from my previous theta allows for continued coexistence while still enabling some hunting to support our population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of making gradual adjustments based on current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing sustainability. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term survival for both.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 35.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for recovery. With a wolf population of 70, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is low, suggesting that we should focus on competition among wolves rather than intense hunting. This will allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a healthy balance in our pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the wolf population is relatively high. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain our population while allowing the sheep to recover. This adjustment is gradual, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.35, which is only 22.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for more hunting intensity while still being cautious, promoting a balance that can support both wolf and sheep populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.57, which is only 17.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I need to increase my hunting intensity to ensure the survival of my pack, I must do so gradually to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach that considers both the current sheep population and the need to maintain a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.63, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population and maintaining a balance with the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be increased slightly to ensure our survival. However, I must be cautious not to overhunt, as the sheep population needs to recover. A gradual increase allows for a sustainable balance while still considering the current wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.92, which is only 10.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to be cautious with our hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta value of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both populations."
