            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 6.11, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. A moderate approach will help maintain a balance between the wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term survival for both.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at its maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to depletion. Maintaining a lower theta allows sheep to recover while we focus on competition among wolves, ensuring long-term balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers, jeopardizing long-term sustainability. Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover and ensures that the wolf population remains stable without overexploiting the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover and prevent overexploitation. This lower theta will also help mitigate competition among wolves as we adapt to the current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while also helping to stabilize the wolf population. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that a moderate increase in hunting intensity is appropriate to maintain balance. This value allows for sustainable coexistence while also supporting the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 101.90, allowing for a slight reduction in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a sustainable balance while still allowing for some hunting to support the wolf population. Gradually adjusting my theta downwards will help ensure that both populations can thrive without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help sustain both the wolf and sheep populations while responding to the current dynamics.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 69.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still a healthy number of sheep available. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.32, it is essential to maintain a balance that allows for both wolf and sheep populations to thrive. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will help ensure that the sheep can recover while still allowing for some hunting to support our wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover and maintain balance. It is important to avoid drastic changes, so a moderate increase is appropriate given the current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 68, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 37.76, which is only 34.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I can increase my hunting intensity slightly, I must do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A theta of 0.45 allows for a moderate increase in hunting while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 29.54, which is only 26.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is some room for hunting, I need to be cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, enabling sustainable coexistence while still considering the need for wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.77, which is only 21.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.40, which is only 17.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is a need to hunt to support the wolf population, a more moderate approach will allow the sheep to recover. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity from 0.450 to 0.40, I can help maintain a balance that supports both species in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.04, which is only 14.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while maintaining a moderate hunting intensity.
