            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 202\n- Sheep population: 11.11\n- Wolf population: 36.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.400\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.31 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 10.1% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still healthy and close to its maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover if needed. A gradual adjustment is key to maintaining balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 81.7% of maximum capacity, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. A slight reduction from my previous theta will help maintain the sheep population while still allowing for some hunting to support the wolf population. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of gradual changes and ensures sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the sheep-to-wolf ratio being 1.30, it is wise to moderate hunting intensity to ensure both populations can thrive. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover and grow.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep too quickly. A moderate increase allows for a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring both populations can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 41.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 69, which is relatively high, I need to be cautious about overhunting. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain a healthy population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery. A gradual increase is prudent to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.55, which is only 24.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.68, which is only 18.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.33, which is only 15.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting, but not enough to deplete the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.80, which is only 13.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly, considering the current wolf population is also relatively high.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.13, which is only 11.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the competition with other wolves, ensuring that we do not deplete the sheep further and can maintain a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.92, which is only 10.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting without risking depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for more hunting intensity while still being cautious, as the wolf population is relatively high at 41.00. This adjustment aims to maintain a sustainable balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.11, which is only 10.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for sustenance with the long-term health of both species."
