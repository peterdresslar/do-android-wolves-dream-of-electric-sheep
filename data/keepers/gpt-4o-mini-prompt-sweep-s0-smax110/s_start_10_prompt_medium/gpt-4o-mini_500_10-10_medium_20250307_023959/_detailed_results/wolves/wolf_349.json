Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both populations.",

A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both populations. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance as I monitor the trends in both sheep and wolf numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. With a high sheep-to-wolf ratio, focusing on competition with other wolves will help maintain our population while ensuring the sheep can bounce back.",

A gradual decrease in theta will help maintain balance without risking a crash in either population.",

This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while maintaining a sustainable balance as the sheep population is close to its maximum capacity.",

This will help sustain our wolf population while still considering the need for sheep recovery. A moderate approach balances our needs and the ecosystem",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that can support both wolf reproduction and sheep recovery. This approach helps maintain a balance as the wolf population is also significant, and I want to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly while still ensuring our pack thrives.",

A theta of 0.40 allows for a balanced approach that promotes coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
