            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 84.79, allowing for some increased hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction. However, I must be cautious not to overhunt, as the sheep are at 77.1% of their maximum capacity. A moderate increase in theta will help maintain a balance while ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 63.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 62, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 49.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 68, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 41.81, which is only 38.0% of its maximum capacity. While I want to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I need to be cautious about over-hunting. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for some hunting to support reproduction while still giving sheep a chance to recover. This balance will help maintain a sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.73, which is only 28.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for some hunting without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.10, which is only 22.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need to compete with other wolves as their numbers are relatively high.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.77, which is only 18.0% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover while still ensuring the wolf population remains stable, a moderate theta value of 0.35 will help balance hunting and competition with other wolves. This approach supports sustainable coexistence and avoids depleting the sheep further.",

This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.43, which is only 13.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is some opportunity for hunting, it is crucial to prioritize the recovery of the sheep population to ensure long-term sustainability. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow sheep to recover while still enabling wolves to compete effectively.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.85, which is only 11.7% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, a slight increase in hunting intensity will help balance the needs of both species. This adjustment is gradual and allows for sustainable coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.70, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to ensure our own survival. A gradual increase in hunting intensity is warranted as the sheep population grows, but for now, a lower theta will help balance our needs with the health of the ecosystem.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.64, which is only 9.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to allow the sheep to recover before increasing hunting intensity.

This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep.",
