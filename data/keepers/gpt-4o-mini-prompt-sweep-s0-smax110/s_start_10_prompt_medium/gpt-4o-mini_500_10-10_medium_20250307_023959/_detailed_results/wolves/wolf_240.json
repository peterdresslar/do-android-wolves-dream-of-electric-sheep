            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still healthy at 94.2% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction without risking a rapid decline in sheep numbers. A moderate approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This approach balances our needs with the ecosystem",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term survival of both species. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to ensure that the wolf population does not grow too quickly and that the sheep can recover if needed.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery. It",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the wolf population is relatively high. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining enough pressure to support wolf reproduction. This moderate approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 29.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 68, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.35, which is only 24.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for more hunting intensity while still being cautious about the wolf population growth. This approach helps maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep can recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.38, which is only 19.4% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will help balance the ecosystem without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.07, which is only 16.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of the wolf pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.49, which is only 14.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.05, which is only 12.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 reflects a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without risking a rapid depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.79, which is only 11.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack without depleting the sheep further. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.10, which is only 11.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is an opportunity to increase hunting intensity slightly to ensure my pack can thrive, while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A gradual increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting sustainability."
