            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that we should reduce our hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while still ensuring our wolf population remains healthy. A moderate increase in hunting will help maintain our numbers without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at maximum capacity, and while I need to maintain hunting to support wolf reproduction, I must also be cautious not to deplete the sheep too quickly. A moderate hunting intensity allows for a sustainable balance, ensuring both populations can thrive in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A balanced approach will help maintain both sheep and wolf populations sustainably, avoiding depletion of resources while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. With a high sheep-to-wolf ratio, focusing on competition with other wolves will help stabilize the wolf population while giving sheep a chance to rebound.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery. Maintaining a lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, preventing overhunting and potential crashes in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that a slight increase in hunting intensity is appropriate to ensure my pack can thrive. However, I must be cautious and avoid overhunting, as the wolf population is still relatively stable. A moderate increase allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling my pack to grow.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 101.90, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and maintain their numbers. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly, and this theta reflects a balanced approach to coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing sustainability. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to ensure that both sheep and wolf populations can thrive without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be adjusted downwards to allow for recovery. This will help maintain a sustainable balance as the wolf population is slightly higher than the sheep population, and a gradual reduction in hunting will support both species",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 68, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 34.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.56, it\u2019s important to maintain a balance that allows for the sheep to recover while also ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help sustain both populations without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 29.54, which is only 26.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still being mindful of the wolf population growth.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.77, which is only 21.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is some room for hunting, it is important to avoid overexploitation. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still giving sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.40, which is only 17.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a more balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.04, which is only 14.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance, reducing hunting intensity slightly to support sheep recovery while still allowing for some hunting to sustain our pack."
