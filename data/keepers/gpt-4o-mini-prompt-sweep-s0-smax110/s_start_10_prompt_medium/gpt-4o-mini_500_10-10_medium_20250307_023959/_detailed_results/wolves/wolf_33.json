            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover and prevent overexploitation. This lower theta will help maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and while I want to increase hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term survival for both.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 89.7% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 85.73, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are enough sheep to sustain our pack without overhunting. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a more cautious approach, ensuring that we do not deplete the sheep too quickly while still allowing for some hunting to support our population. This balance will help maintain the ecosystem",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly. It reflects a cautious approach to ensure both populations can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 50.1% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term survival of both species. This moderate adjustment helps maintain a balance as the wolf population is relatively high, and I want to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment reflects a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover and maintain their population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level relative to its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both sheep and wolves while still competing effectively with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.05, which is only 22.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is an opportunity for hunting, we must be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach that supports wolf reproduction while still considering the long-term sustainability of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.09, which is only 18.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is an opportunity to hunt, I need to be cautious and not overexert pressure on the sheep. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population and reducing competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.98, which is only 15.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a more balanced approach while still being mindful of the need to avoid overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.68, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.19, which is only 12.0% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will enable me to hunt more effectively while still prioritizing the long-term balance of the ecosystem."
