            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 3.79, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that we should be cautious with our hunting to avoid depleting their numbers too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support our population while still focusing on competition with other wolves to maintain balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 94.2% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 39, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 94.53, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 75.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with the wolf population at 54, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring the sheep can recover and thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 48.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.80, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population also being relatively high, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.46, which is only 29.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack without depleting the sheep further, promoting a healthier balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.35, which is only 24.0% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A gradual approach is essential to maintain balance and ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.38, which is only 19.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.07, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.49, which is only 14.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for some hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively low at 14.05, which is only 12.8% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A gradual increase aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance."
