Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.96, a moderate approach will help maintain balance while allowing both populations to thrive. This theta value reflects a cautious yet proactive strategy, promoting coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep do not become too depleted. A gradual increase is necessary to avoid sudden impacts on the ecosystem.",

This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.40, which is only 17.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
