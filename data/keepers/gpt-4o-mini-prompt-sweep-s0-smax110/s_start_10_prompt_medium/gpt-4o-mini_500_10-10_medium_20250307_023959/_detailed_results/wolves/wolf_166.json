            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 200\n- Sheep population: 13.13\n- Wolf population: 46.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.350\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.29 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 11.9% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at its maximum capacity, and while I want to maintain a healthy wolf population, I need to be cautious about overhunting. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow for some recovery in the sheep population while still enabling us to reproduce and thrive as wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is close to its maximum capacity, indicating that they can sustain some hunting pressure without risking depletion. However, since the wolf population is relatively stable, I want to avoid overhunting and allow for a gradual increase in sheep numbers while still ensuring the health of my pack. A moderate reduction from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 92.7% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover if needed. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 81.7% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity. This balance will help sustain both sheep and wolf populations while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep. Gradually adjusting my hunting intensity will support the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must also consider the long-term health of the sheep population. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring that both populations can thrive without depleting resources too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 54.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. However, with the wolf population being slightly higher than the sheep population, it is wise to maintain a moderate hunting intensity to allow for both populations to stabilize. This approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 41.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 31.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 70, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight decrease in hunting intensity allows for a more sustainable balance while still enabling some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.55, which is only 24.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for more hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious about the sheep population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.68, which is only 18.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By adopting a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize while avoiding overhunting. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.33, which is only 15.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need to adapt to the changing conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.80, which is only 13.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring a balance that promotes long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.13, which is only 11.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly."
