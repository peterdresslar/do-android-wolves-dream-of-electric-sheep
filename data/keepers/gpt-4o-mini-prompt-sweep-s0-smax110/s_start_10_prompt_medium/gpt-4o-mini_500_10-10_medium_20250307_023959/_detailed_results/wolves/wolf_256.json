            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 82.83, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports the wolf population's growth without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but I need to be cautious as the wolf population is also growing. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while ensuring that the sheep can recover and maintain their numbers, promoting a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for some hunting without risking depletion. With the wolf population also being relatively high, a slight reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and allow both populations to stabilize. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of responding to current conditions while ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 37.5% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term survival for both.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.46, which is only 29.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack while prioritizing the long-term balance of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.35, which is only 24.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of the wolf population.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.49, which is only 14.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, reducing hunting intensity to promote sheep recovery while still ensuring our survival.",

While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help me maintain a balance between hunting and allowing the sheep to grow, avoiding any drastic changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.79, which is only 11.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while giving sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.10, which is only 11.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting without risking depletion. However, with a wolf population of 35.00, it",
