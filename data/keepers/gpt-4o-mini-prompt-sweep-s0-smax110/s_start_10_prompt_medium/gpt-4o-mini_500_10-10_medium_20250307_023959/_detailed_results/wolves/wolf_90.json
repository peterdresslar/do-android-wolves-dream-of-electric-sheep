            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. A lower theta allows for competition among wolves, which can help maintain our numbers while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment will help ensure long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. With a current sheep-to-wolf ratio of 5.5, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to depletion of their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover and ensures the long-term survival of both species. It also helps to stabilize the wolf population as we adapt to the current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery. Maintaining a lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, as it prevents overhunting and allows the sheep population to stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be increased slightly to maintain balance without depleting resources too quickly. A gradual increase allows for sustainable coexistence while also considering the current wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that they can sustain a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. A gradual increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the long-term health of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 95.5% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 38, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep. This moderate adjustment helps ensure that both populations can thrive without risking depletion or overcompetition.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 76.9% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 53, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, but the wolf population is also significant. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling us to compete effectively with other wolves. This adjustment aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence and avoids sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. Given the current wolf population, a slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow for a more balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still ensuring the wolves can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still maintaining a balance with the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.95, which is only 24.5% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.63, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf competition and sheep recovery, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.77, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A slight decrease from my previous theta will help balance the competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring the long-term survival of both species."
