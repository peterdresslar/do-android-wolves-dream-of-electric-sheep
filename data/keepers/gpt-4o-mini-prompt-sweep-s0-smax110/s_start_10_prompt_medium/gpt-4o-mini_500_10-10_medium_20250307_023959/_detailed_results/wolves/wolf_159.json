            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover and maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem. This gradual adjustment will help prevent overhunting and ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at its maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery. Maintaining a lower theta helps ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, avoiding overhunting and potential crashes in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that we should be cautious with our hunting to avoid depleting their numbers too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations while ensuring our pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment reflects a balance between ensuring the wolf population can thrive while allowing the sheep to recover and maintain their numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 81.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.80, it is essential to maintain a balance that allows for sustainable coexistence. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help ensure that both populations can thrive without depleting the sheep too quickly, while still allowing for some hunting to support the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 54.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 65, which is relatively high compared to the sheep, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and allow both populations to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 41.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level relative to its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A slight decrease from my previous theta will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can stabilize and grow.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.55, which is only 24.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for moderate hunting without risking the depletion of the sheep population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach that supports wolf reproduction while still being mindful of the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.68, which is only 18.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.33, which is only 15.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.80, which is only 13.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is an opportunity to hunt, I must be cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate approach allows for some hunting while still giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term survival for both species."
