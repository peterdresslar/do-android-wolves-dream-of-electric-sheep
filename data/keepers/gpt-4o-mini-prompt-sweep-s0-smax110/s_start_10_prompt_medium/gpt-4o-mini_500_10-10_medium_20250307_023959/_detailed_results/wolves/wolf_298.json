            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. A lower theta will help maintain the balance between wolves and sheep while preventing overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. A gradual increase from my previous theta will help balance the competition with other wolves while still considering the sustainability of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. A slight increase in hunting intensity will allow for some sheep population control while still prioritizing the long-term health of both species. This moderate approach helps maintain a balance without risking over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between the wolf and sheep populations, ensuring sustainable coexistence while also allowing for some growth in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 89.1% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 46, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, but I want to ensure that we do not overhunt and deplete their numbers too quickly. A slight decrease in hunting intensity allows for a sustainable balance while still enabling our wolf population to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still considering the need to maintain a balance with the sheep population. A gradual increase is prudent to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 49.5% of its maximum capacity, which indicates that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.80, a slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow for a more balanced approach, helping both populations to stabilize and thrive over time.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 38.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 70, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting, which could lead to a crash in the sheep population. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for more hunting while still maintaining a balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.73, which is only 28.8% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a focus on competition with other wolves, a moderate theta value of 0.35 will help balance our needs without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.10, which is only 22.8% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to help sustain my pack",

This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate increase to 0.45 allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.84, which is only 15.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack while not over-depleting the sheep, promoting a more balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.43, which is only 13.1% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking the depletion of the sheep population. A moderate increase to 0.40 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for wolf reproduction with the sustainability of the sheep.",
