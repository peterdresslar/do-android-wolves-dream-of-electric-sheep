However, with a relatively low wolf population, I need to ensure that we maintain a balance to prevent overhunting. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help support our reproduction while allowing the sheep population to stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at maximum capacity, and while it is important to maintain hunting intensity for wolf reproduction, I must also consider the long-term sustainability of the sheep population. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while preventing over-depletion of the sheep, ensuring both populations can thrive.",

A balanced approach will help maintain both the sheep and wolf populations sustainably, avoiding depletion while still allowing for some hunting.",

By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",

Maintaining a lower theta will help prevent over-depletion of the sheep, ensuring long-term survival for both species while allowing for gradual adjustments as conditions change.",

This moderate adjustment will also support the wolf population without risking a drastic decline.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still maintaining a sustainable balance with the sheep population. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the sheep population at 47.1% of its maximum capacity, I can afford to maintain a slightly lower hunting intensity to ensure the sheep can recover while still allowing for some reproduction among the wolves. This adjustment helps avoid over-depletion of the sheep and supports a sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 39.36, which is only 35.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is some opportunity for hunting, I need to be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still enabling some hunting to support reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 30.28, which is only 27.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is some potential for hunting, it is crucial to avoid overexploitation to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.35, which is only 22.1% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking the depletion of the sheep population. A moderate increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, enabling us to maintain our wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover gradually."
