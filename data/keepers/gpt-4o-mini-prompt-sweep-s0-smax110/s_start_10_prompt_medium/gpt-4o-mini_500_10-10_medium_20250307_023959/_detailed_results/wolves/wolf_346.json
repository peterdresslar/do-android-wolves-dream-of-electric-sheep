            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery. Maintaining a lower theta will help prevent overhunting and ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover while ensuring the wolf population remains stable. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover and prevents overexploitation, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and focuses on long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover and ensures the long-term survival of both species. Additionally, with the wolf population at 12, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery. Maintaining a lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, preventing overhunting and allowing for a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and maintaining a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover and prevent overexploitation. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both wolves and sheep, aligning with the wisdom of gradual adjustments.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in sheep numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover while also keeping the wolf population stable. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover and prevents overexploitation. This approach also helps stabilize the wolf population as we face competition from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery. Maintaining a lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, as it prevents overhunting and allows the sheep population to stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover while preventing overcompetition among wolves. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to depletion of their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This balance is crucial for the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating a need for a slight increase in hunting intensity to ensure the wolf population can thrive. However, I must be cautious and avoid overhunting, so I will make a moderate adjustment to maintain balance and allow for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 101.90, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover if needed. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can still recover. A gradual adjustment is key to maintaining balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight reduction in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a balance as the wolf population grows, ensuring both species can thrive without depleting resources too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting approach. This will help maintain the balance between the wolf and sheep populations while also considering the recent growth in wolf numbers. A slight decrease from my previous theta will help ensure that we do not over-deplete the sheep, allowing for their recovery and the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 68, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, allowing for some increased hunting without risking depletion. However, with the wolf population also being relatively high, a moderate approach will help maintain balance and prevent overexploitation of the sheep. This gradual increase in hunting intensity will support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize our population while giving the sheep a chance to rebound. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.77, which is only 21.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to help sustain our wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of my pack."
