            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 203\n- Sheep population: 10.77\n- Wolf population: 32.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.300\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.34 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 9.8% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 101.97, which allows for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking over-depletion. This value supports my objective of maintaining a healthy wolf population while ensuring the sheep can recover if needed. It reflects a balanced approach, allowing for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 81.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with a wolf population of 50, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both populations can thrive. A moderate increase in hunting intensity allows for a balance that supports wolf reproduction while giving sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while I want to maintain a healthy wolf population, I also recognize the need to allow the sheep to recover slightly. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help balance our needs without risking a depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 54.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 65, which is relatively high, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, ensuring that both sheep and wolves can thrive without depleting resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 41.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. However, the wolf population is relatively high, so I need to focus on competition among wolves to avoid overhunting and allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain balance while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover gradually.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.55, which is only 24.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, ensuring that I can still hunt effectively while also considering the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.68, which is only 18.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is some room for hunting, it is crucial to avoid overexploitation to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 reflects a more cautious approach, focusing on maintaining balance and ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.33, which is only 15.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for more hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious to avoid overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.80, which is only 13.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting while prioritizing the long-term balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.13, which is only 11.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly. By increasing theta slightly from 0.35 to 0.40, I can maintain a balanced approach that allows for some hunting while still considering the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.92, which is only 10.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still enabling some hunting to support our population without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.11, which is only 10.1% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.77, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be slightly increased to support wolf reproduction, it is crucial to avoid overhunting to allow the sheep population to recover. A small increase to 0.35 reflects a cautious approach to balance both populations sustainably."
