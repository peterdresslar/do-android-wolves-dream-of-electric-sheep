            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 201\n- Sheep population: 11.92\n- Wolf population: 41.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.400\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.29 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 10.8% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that we should maintain a balanced approach to hunting. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some hunting to support wolf reproduction. This adjustment helps prevent over-depletion of the sheep population while considering the current trends.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still healthy at 101.97, which allows for a balanced approach to hunting. Maintaining a moderate theta of 0.50 will help ensure that both the sheep and wolf populations can coexist sustainably while allowing for gradual adjustments as conditions change.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 81.7% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 50, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but I need to be cautious as the wolf population is also growing. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still ensuring that my pack can thrive. This moderate adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a balance and responding to the current ecosystem state.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 54.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 65, which is relatively high, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on maintaining a balance with the other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 41.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.66, it is essential to maintain a balance that allows both populations to thrive. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help the sheep recover while still allowing for some hunting to support the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment reflects a balance between the need to support wolf reproduction and the importance of maintaining the sheep population for future cycles.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.55, which is only 24.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is some room for hunting, we must be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for sustainable hunting while still focusing on the competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.68, which is only 18.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate increase to 0.35 allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.33, which is only 15.8% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A gradual increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.80, which is only 13.5% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.13, which is only 11.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some reproduction among wolves while still giving sheep a chance to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach that considers both the need for wolf population maintenance and the sustainability of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.92, which is only 10.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting a lower theta, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize while still ensuring the wolf pack"
