            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 201\n- Sheep population: 11.92\n- Wolf population: 41.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.350\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.29 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 10.8% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that a more moderate hunting intensity is appropriate. This allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves. A gradual adjustment helps maintain balance without risking a sudden decline in sheep or wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 101.97, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. This moderate theta value will help maintain the sheep population while ensuring the wolf pack remains healthy. It allows for gradual adjustments as conditions change, promoting sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 81.7% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 50, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while I want to ensure my pack thrives, I also recognize the need to allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and prevent over-depletion of the sheep population, which is crucial for long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations while also considering the recent growth in wolf numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 41.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that considers both the current sheep population and the need to maintain a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.55, which is only 24.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is some room for hunting, it is crucial to prioritize the recovery of the sheep population to ensure long-term sustainability. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while also focusing on competition with other wolves, helping to stabilize the wolf population without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.68, which is only 18.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to help sustain our population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help balance the need for food and the health of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.33, which is only 15.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased slightly, it is crucial to maintain a cautious approach to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 reflects a balance between hunting and competing with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.80, which is only 13.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased slightly to support wolf reproduction, it is crucial to avoid over-depleting the sheep. A moderate increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach that supports both populations without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.13, which is only 11.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.4 to 0.35, I can maintain a focus on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring that both populations can stabilize and thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.92, which is only 10.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should be cautious with our hunting to allow the sheep to recover. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.29, there is a need to slightly increase our hunting intensity to ensure our pack"
