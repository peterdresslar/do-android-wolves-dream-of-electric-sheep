However, with the wolf population at 60, it is wise to maintain a slightly lower hunting intensity to allow for recovery and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. This adjustment aligns with the need for balance and gradual adaptation to ensure the long-term survival of both species.",

However, the wolf population is also relatively high, so a moderate increase in hunting intensity allows for some sheep depletion while still considering the long-term health of both populations. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, but the wolf population is also significant. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain their numbers. This approach supports a sustainable balance without risking a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.08, which is only 29.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I can increase my hunting intensity slightly, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep too quickly. A small increase to 0.45 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.05, which is only 22.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.45 to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, focusing on sustainable coexistence while still considering the need for wolf population health.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.09, which is only 18.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring a balance that can support both populations in the long term."
