This will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance and avoid over-depletion of the sheep.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 39.36, which is only 35.8% of its maximum capacity. While I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",

This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack without depleting the sheep further, promoting a healthier balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.35, which is only 22.1% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still being cautious. By raising theta to 0.40, I can focus on ensuring the wolf population remains healthy without depleting the sheep too quickly. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",

This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 to 0.35 reflects a cautious approach to balance competition with other wolves and the need for sustainable sheep hunting.",
