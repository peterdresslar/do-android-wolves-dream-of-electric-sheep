            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover and prevent overexploitation. This lower theta value will help maintain a balance while avoiding sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be cautiously increased to prevent over-depletion. However, with a wolf population of 19, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a high availability of prey. However, to ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain balance and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderate to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the balance between wolf and sheep populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing sheep to recover. A gradual increase is essential to avoid sudden population crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a moderate hunting approach that ensures sustainability. With the sheep-to-wolf ratio at 2.05, it\u2019s wise to focus on maintaining balance rather than intensifying hunting. This will help prevent over-depletion of the sheep while allowing for gradual adjustments as conditions change.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 82.83, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment reflects a balanced approach, considering the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need to maintain wolf health. Gradually increasing theta will help sustain both populations while avoiding sudden shifts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual increase in theta will support both immediate hunting needs and long-term ecosystem balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the sheep population at 48.8% of its maximum capacity, I can maintain a sustainable level of hunting while ensuring that both sheep and wolf populations can thrive. This slight reduction from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach as the wolf population is also significant, which helps prevent over-exploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and while it is important to maintain a healthy wolf population, I need to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta will help balance hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring that both populations can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 29.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 68, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.35, which is only 24.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.35 to 0.40, I can focus on hunting while still allowing for the sheep population to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.38, which is only 19.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it is crucial to avoid overexploitation. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to thrive. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.07, which is only 16.4% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being mindful of the sheep"
