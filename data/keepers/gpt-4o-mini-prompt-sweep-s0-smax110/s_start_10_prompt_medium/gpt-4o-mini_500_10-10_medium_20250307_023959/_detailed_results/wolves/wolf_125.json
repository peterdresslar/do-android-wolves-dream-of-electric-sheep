            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports both wolf reproduction and sheep recovery. This balance helps ensure the long-term survival of both species while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 64.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with a wolf population of 60, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to prevent a crash in the sheep population. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring both populations can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 51.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 66.00, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for more hunting to support wolf reproduction while still maintaining a balance that prevents overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level relative to its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain its health. This moderate approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.95, which is only 24.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I can increase my hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate increase to 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.63, which is only 19.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.35, I can focus more on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I need to maintain a balance, a slight increase in hunting intensity will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. This adjustment allows for a gradual response to the current conditions while keeping an eye on the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.47, which is only 14.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is a need for wolves to hunt to sustain their population, it is crucial to avoid overhunting to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term balance between the two populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.74, which is only 12.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some reproduction among wolves while still giving sheep a chance to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without risking a rapid depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.59, which is only 11.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the competition with other wolves, ensuring a balance that supports both populations in the long run.",

A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.22, which is only 10.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, promoting a gradual balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.91, which is only 9.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still being mindful of the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.79, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population. This gradual adjustment helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.84, which is only 9.9% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting sheep. This will help balance the populations and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.02, which is only 10% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population and maintaining a balance with the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.25, which is only 10.2% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will enable me to hunt more effectively without depleting the sheep too quickly, promoting a sustainable balance."
