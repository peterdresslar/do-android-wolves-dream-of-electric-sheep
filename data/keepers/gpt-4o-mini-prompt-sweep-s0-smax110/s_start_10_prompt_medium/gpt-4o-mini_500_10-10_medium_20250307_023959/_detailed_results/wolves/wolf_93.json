To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition with other wolves. A gradual increase in theta will help maintain balance without overwhelming the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity slightly to allow the sheep to recover while still competing with other wolves. This moderate approach will help maintain a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that we should be cautious with our hunting to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that we need to reduce hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 4.23, it is crucial to focus on competition among wolves rather than depleting the sheep further. This adjustment will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at maximum capacity, and while I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta will enable me to maintain some hunting intensity while still prioritizing the balance of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is near its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 95.5% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population while still enabling the sheep to recover. A gradual increase is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring a balanced ecosystem.",

A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves. This approach balances the needs of both populations without risking depletion of the sheep.",

This adjustment helps support wolf reproduction without risking a significant depletion of the sheep population. It reflects a cautious approach to ensure both species can thrive together.",
