            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 123\n- Sheep population: 71.28\n- Wolf population: 60.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.742\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 1.19 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 64.8% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring both populations can thrive without leading to a crash.",

A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to thrive. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",

This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still being cautious. A moderate increase to 0.45 reflects a balanced approach, enabling us to sustain our wolf population without over-depleting the sheep. It also allows for gradual adjustments as conditions change.",
