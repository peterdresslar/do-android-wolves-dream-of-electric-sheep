            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 200\n- Sheep population: 13.13\n- Wolf population: 46.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.350\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.29 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 11.9% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 4.07, it is crucial to focus on competition among wolves to prevent overhunting and ensure long-term sustainability. A gradual decrease in theta will help maintain balance without causing sudden population crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. A lower theta allows for a focus on competing with other wolves, which can help reduce our numbers slightly and give the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that they can sustain a bit more hunting pressure without risking depletion. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain a healthy wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover slightly from previous pressures.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 92.7% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 41, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 89.82, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep. This moderate adjustment will help maintain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports the growth of the wolf population while still considering the need for balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 54.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 65, which is relatively high, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight decrease in hunting intensity allows for a balance that can support both populations without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 41.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 69, it is wise to maintain a moderate hunting intensity to allow both populations to stabilize. This approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 31.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 70, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting, which could lead to a crash in the sheep population. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on the long-term balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.55, which is only 24.1% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. A moderate increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence and sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.68, which is only 18.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to allow for recovery. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both sheep and wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.33, which is only 15.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.80, which is only 13.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is some opportunity for hunting, it is crucial to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both populations. It reflects a cautious approach to ensure that we do not deplete the sheep further, which could jeopardize our own future.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.13, which is only 11.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain my pack while allowing the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of my wolf pack."
