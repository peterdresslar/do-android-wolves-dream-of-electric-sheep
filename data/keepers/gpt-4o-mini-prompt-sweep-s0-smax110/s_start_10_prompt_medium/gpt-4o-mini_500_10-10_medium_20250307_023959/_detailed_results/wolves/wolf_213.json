With the sheep-to-wolf ratio at 1.12, it is wise to maintain a moderate hunting intensity to ensure the long-term survival of both populations. This adjustment allows for gradual adaptation to the current conditions without risking depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing coexistence. This moderate adjustment helps ensure that both the wolf and sheep populations can thrive without depleting resources too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 41.28, which is only 37.5% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting sheep. This will allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a healthy balance in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.46, which is only 29.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is potential for recovery if I reduce hunting intensity slightly. By increasing theta from 0.35 to 0.40, I can still maintain some hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.35, which is only 24.0% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.400 aligns with the wisdom of making small adjustments based on current conditions."
