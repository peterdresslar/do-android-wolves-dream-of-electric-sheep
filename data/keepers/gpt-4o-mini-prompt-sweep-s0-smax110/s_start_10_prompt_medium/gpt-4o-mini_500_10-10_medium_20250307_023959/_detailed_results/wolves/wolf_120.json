            "I chose this theta because it represents a moderate approach to hunting that balances the need for wolf population growth with the sustainability of the sheep population. Given that the sheep population is still below its maximum capacity and the wolf population is relatively stable, a slight increase in hunting intensity will help support reproduction without risking a significant depletion of sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual increase aligns with the current trends and avoids sudden shifts that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 51.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population being higher than the sheep population, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring that both populations can thrive without leading to depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 68, it is wise to focus slightly more on competition with other wolves to prevent overhunting and allow both populations to stabilize. A gradual adjustment to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach that considers both immediate needs and long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still considering the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.95, which is only 24.5% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, allowing both populations to stabilize without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.63, which is only 19.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.77, which is only 16.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to allow the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack without depleting the sheep further, promoting a balance between competition and hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.47, which is only 14.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.74, which is only 12.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term survival.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the wolf population is relatively high. A moderate hunting intensity allows for some hunting while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This approach helps maintain a balance between both populations and avoids depleting the sheep further.",

While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.91, which is only 9.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By adopting a lower theta, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize while still ensuring the wolf pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.79, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a bit more hunting to support reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.84, which is only 9.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to stabilize while still competing with other wolves.
