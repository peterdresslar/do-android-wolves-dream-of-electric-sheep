            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 481\n- Sheep population: 17.00\n- Wolf population: 55.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.350\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.31 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 15.5% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to prevent depletion. A balanced approach allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some hunting to support the wolf population. This adjustment helps maintain a dynamic equilibrium between both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A lower theta will help maintain a balance between competing wolves and the sheep population, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. A moderate approach will help maintain the balance between wolves and sheep, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover and prevent overexploitation. This lower theta will help maintain a balance while considering the current high sheep population and the need to avoid competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at its maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep too quickly. A small increase allows for a more sustainable balance while still considering the current trends in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 94.4% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 41, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 93.97, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly, considering the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 74.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. A moderate increase to 0.55 allows for a balanced approach, enabling us to hunt effectively while ensuring the sheep population can recover and thrive. This adjustment also considers the growing wolf population, which necessitates a careful balance to avoid over-depletion of our prey.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight decrease in hunting intensity while still enabling reproduction among wolves. This adjustment helps maintain balance as the sheep population is recovering, and it prevents overexploitation, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance of the ecosystem. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the wolf population is relatively high. A slight decrease in hunting intensity allows for a balance that supports both populations, giving sheep a chance to recover while preventing overcompetition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 30.28, which is only 27.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to allow for recovery. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both sheep and wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.35, which is only 22.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.57, which is only 17.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery of the sheep. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need to compete with other wolves while still allowing sheep to stabilize and grow.",
