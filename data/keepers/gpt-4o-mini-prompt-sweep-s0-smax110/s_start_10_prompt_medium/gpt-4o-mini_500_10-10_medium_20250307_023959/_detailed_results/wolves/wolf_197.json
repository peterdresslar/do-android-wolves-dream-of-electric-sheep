            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. This value will help sustain both the sheep and wolf populations while gradually increasing hunting intensity as the sheep numbers rise. It reflects a cautious yet proactive strategy to ensure long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 41.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both populations can thrive. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.64, which is only 31.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I need to maintain a focus on hunting to support wolf reproduction, I must also be cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. A slight reduction in hunting intensity allows for some recovery of the sheep while still enabling wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.55, which is only 24.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for moderate hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.68, which is only 18.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta value of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing competition with other wolves, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.33, which is only 15.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.80, which is only 13.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring a balance that promotes long-term sustainability for both species.",

This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from the previous theta of 0.4 to 0.35, I can still maintain a focus on competition with other wolves while allowing for some sustainable hunting. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.11, which is only 10.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to gradually increase without depleting their numbers further. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.77, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are in a vulnerable state, and a slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain our population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A gradual increase to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, ensuring both our survival and the recovery of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.54, which is only 9.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without risking the sheep population too much. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting sustainability while still being mindful of the current low sheep numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.37, which is only 9.4% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population.
