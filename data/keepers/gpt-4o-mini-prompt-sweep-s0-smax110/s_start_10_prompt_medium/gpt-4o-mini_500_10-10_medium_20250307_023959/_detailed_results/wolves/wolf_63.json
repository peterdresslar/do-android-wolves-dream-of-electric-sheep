            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This will help support wolf reproduction while still maintaining a healthy sheep population. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need to avoid sudden changes, a moderate increase in theta will help ensure long-term balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. This value will help maintain a sustainable coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves. It reflects a gradual increase in hunting intensity, responding to the sheep population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 29.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 69, which is relatively high, I need to be cautious about overhunting. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while also giving sheep a chance to recover and maintain a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.05, which is only 22.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is an opportunity to hunt, I should be cautious and not over-exploit the sheep to allow for their recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.45 to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for sustainable coexistence while still considering the need to compete with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.09, which is only 18.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased slightly to support wolf reproduction, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate increase to 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.98, which is only 15.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By adopting a lower theta value, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.68, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.19, which is only 12.0% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing competition with other wolves, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.00, which is only 10.9% of its maximum capacity. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while also addressing the competition among wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.44, which is only 10.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is an opportunity to increase hunting intensity slightly without risking immediate depletion of the sheep. A small increase to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still being mindful of the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.03, which is only 10.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help ensure the sheep population stabilizes while allowing the wolf population to adjust gradually. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.82, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I need to be cautious about hunting too intensely, a slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted to allow for some reproduction among wolves. A theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.77, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a stable wolf population. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of adapting to changing conditions and avoiding sudden shifts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.90, which is only 9.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while we need to be cautious about overhunting, a slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted to help sustain our population. A theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while giving sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.11, which is only 10.1% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and avoid depleting their numbers further, I need to focus on competing with other wolves rather than intensifying hunting. This lower theta will help maintain a balance and ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.49, which is only 10.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.86, which is only 10.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly."
