            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 85.9% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This balance helps maintain a sustainable ecosystem without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 75.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with the wolf population at 54, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the sheep-to-wolf ratio being slightly above 1, it is wise to maintain a moderate hunting intensity to ensure both populations can thrive without depleting resources too quickly. This adjustment allows for gradual adaptation to the current conditions while keeping an eye on future trends.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population while still considering the need for sustainable coexistence. A gradual approach is essential to maintain balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 41.28, which is only 37.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate increase to 0.375 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.46, which is only 29.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a moderate hunting intensity is appropriate to allow for some recovery of the sheep while still ensuring the wolf population can sustain itself. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.375 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.35, which is only 24.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is room for the sheep to recover, I should not increase hunting intensity too much, as the wolf population is also significant at 64.00. A moderate theta of 0.40 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.38, which is only 19.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.07, which is only 16.4% of its maximum capacity. While it is important to hunt to support wolf reproduction, I need to be cautious and avoid over-depleting the sheep. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a more balanced approach, giving the sheep a chance to recover while still ensuring the wolf population remains healthy.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.49, which is only 14.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively low at 14.05, which is only 12.8% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.35 helps maintain balance and allows for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.79, which is only 11.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.10, which is only 11.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for gradual hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring both populations can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.50, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between our population and the sheep, ensuring both can thrive in the long term."
