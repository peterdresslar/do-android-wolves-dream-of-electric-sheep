            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep have a chance to rebound.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is very close to its maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be kept moderate to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 89.7% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while ensuring that we do not deplete their numbers too quickly. This moderate adjustment helps maintain a balance between our needs and the sustainability of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, I must remain cautious and avoid overhunting, as the wolf population is also significant. A gradual increase helps maintain balance while ensuring both populations can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 50.1% of maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 67.00, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure our long-term survival. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because it represents a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balanced approach. The sheep population is currently at 38.2% of its maximum capacity, which allows for some hunting without risking depletion. This adjustment will help sustain both populations as I respond to the current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 29.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 69, which is relatively high, I need to be cautious about overhunting. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain their numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.05, which is only 22.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for more effective hunting while still considering the long-term survival of both species. This approach helps maintain a balance as the wolf population is relatively high.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.09, which is only 18.3% of its maximum capacity. Given the high wolf population of 62, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.98, which is only 15.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to help sustain our population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help balance the need for hunting with the necessity of maintaining a healthy ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.68, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting a theta of 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.19, which is only 12.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sustainable coexistence."
