            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 89.7% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, but the wolf population is also significant. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover further while still enabling the wolves to thrive. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 64.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 60, it is wise to avoid over-hunting to prevent a decline in sheep numbers and ensure our long-term survival. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that supports both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 50.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.82, it is important to maintain a balanced approach to ensure the sheep can recover while also allowing for some hunting to support the wolf population. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a more sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly, considering the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need for gradual changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 29.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is potential for recovery. With a wolf population of 69, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is low, suggesting that focusing more on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a healthy wolf population. This moderate approach helps ensure long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.05, which is only 22.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without risking the depletion of the sheep population. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still being mindful of the need to compete with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.09, which is only 18.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while we can increase our hunting intensity slightly, we must be cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, enabling us to compete with other wolves while still allowing the sheep population to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.98, which is only 15.4% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will enable me to hunt a bit more effectively while still prioritizing the sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.68, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack without over-depleting the sheep, promoting a healthier balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.19, which is only 12.0% of its maximum capacity. While I need to increase my hunting intensity to ensure the survival of my pack, I must do so gradually to avoid depleting the sheep population further. A slight increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach that supports both my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.00, which is only 10.9% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. This approach will help balance the ecosystem and prevent overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I need to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.03, which is only 10.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also considering the growing wolf population. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance and prevent overexploitation of the sheep, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.82, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more moderate hunting intensity is necessary to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain its health. By increasing theta slightly from 0.35 to 0.40, I can promote a sustainable balance between hunting and competition with other wolves without risking a dramatic decline in the sheep population."
