            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 202\n- Sheep population: 11.11\n- Wolf population: 36.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.350\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.31 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 10.1% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 92.7% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 41, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, but the wolf population is also significant. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to sustain themselves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring sustainability in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 41.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.66, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.64, which is only 31.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I need to maintain some hunting to support the wolf population, I should not overhunt to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 will help balance the need for food with the sustainability of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.55, which is only 24.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is some opportunity for hunting, we must be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the sustainability of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.68, which is only 18.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I need to maintain some hunting to support wolf reproduction, I should prioritize a more cautious approach to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 reflects a balance that encourages coexistence while still considering the needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.33, which is only 15.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for gradual hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a more balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of the wolf pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.80, which is only 13.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to stabilize while still competing with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.13, which is only 11.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach that supports wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.92, which is only 10.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support our wolf population without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.11, which is only 10.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By increasing my theta slightly from 0.35 to 0.40, I can maintain a balance that supports both my hunting needs and the sustainability of the sheep population, while still being mindful of the growing wolf population."
