            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 487\n- Sheep population: 10.61\n- Wolf population: 27.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.350\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.39 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 9.6% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 85.4% of maximum capacity, allowing for some hunting without risking depletion. However, my previous theta was very low, and I need to gradually increase my hunting intensity to ensure the wolf population can thrive. A theta of 0.25 allows for a cautious approach that balances the need for food with the sustainability of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations while avoiding overhunting. A gradual adjustment is essential to ensure sustainability and prevent drastic fluctuations in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is key to avoiding drastic fluctuations in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 47.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.75, it is essential to maintain a balance that allows both populations to thrive. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help ensure the sheep can recover while also allowing the wolf population to stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 39.36, which is only 35.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 30.28, which is only 27.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support the wolf population without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.35, which is only 22.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for increased hunting without risking immediate depletion. However, with a wolf population of 65, I must also be cautious to avoid overhunting. A slight increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the sustainability of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance while still considering the competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I need to increase my hunting intensity to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.63, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to allow the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still permitting some hunting to sustain our pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I need to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.92, which is only 10.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population. This gradual adjustment is essential for long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low at 11.20, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate increase will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.75, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity slightly. This will allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A gradual adjustment helps avoid sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.61, which is only 9.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without risking a crash in the sheep population."
