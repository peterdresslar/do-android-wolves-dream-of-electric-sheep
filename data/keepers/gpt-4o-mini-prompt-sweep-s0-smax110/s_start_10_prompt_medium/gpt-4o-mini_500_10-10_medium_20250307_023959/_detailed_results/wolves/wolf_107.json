            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help sustain both the wolf and sheep populations while avoiding sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still healthy at 96.04, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This balance helps maintain the ecosystem without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 76.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still a healthy number of sheep available. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.60, it is wise to adopt a moderate hunting intensity to ensure that both populations can thrive. This balance allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some hunting to support wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while it is beneficial to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep too quickly. A moderate adjustment allows for a balance that supports both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term health of both species. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to ensure sustainable coexistence, especially as the wolf population is relatively high.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover gradually.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 31.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.51, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.95, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking over-depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations while still considering the need for wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.63, which is only 19.7% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, allowing for sustainable coexistence while still addressing the needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.77, which is only 16.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for sustenance with the long-term health of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.47, which is only 14.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.74, which is only 12.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.4 to 0.35, I can maintain a balance that focuses on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.59, which is only 11.4% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 to 0.40 reflects a cautious approach to hunting, balancing the need for sustenance with the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.76, which is only 10.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep, ensuring that both populations can thrive."
