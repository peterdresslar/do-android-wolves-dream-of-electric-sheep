            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at its maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A theta of 0.45 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for some hunting while also considering the need to maintain sheep numbers for future sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. A lower theta will help balance competition among wolves while preventing overhunting of sheep, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. With a high sheep-to-wolf ratio, focusing on competition among wolves will help maintain balance and prevent over-depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution in hunting to prevent depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term balance of the ecosystem. This approach helps maintain the wolf population without overwhelming the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating a need for cautious hunting to prevent over-depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is close to its maximum capacity, indicating a need for careful hunting to avoid depleting their numbers. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still focusing on maintaining a balance with the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 89.1% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help ensure the wolf population remains healthy without over-depleting the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while I want to ensure my pack thrives, I also recognize the need to allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and prevent over-depletion of the sheep population, ensuring long-term survival for both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a balance as the sheep population is recovering, while also considering the growing wolf population. A gradual increase will support sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 41.81, which is only 38.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A slight decrease from my previous theta will help balance the competition among wolves and ensure sustainable hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.73, which is only 28.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, a more moderate approach is necessary to allow the sheep to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.10, which is only 22.8% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep can recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.77, which is only 18.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I can increase hunting intensity slightly, I must be cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while still giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.84, which is only 15.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without over-depleting the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.43, which is only 13.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support our wolf population without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance."
