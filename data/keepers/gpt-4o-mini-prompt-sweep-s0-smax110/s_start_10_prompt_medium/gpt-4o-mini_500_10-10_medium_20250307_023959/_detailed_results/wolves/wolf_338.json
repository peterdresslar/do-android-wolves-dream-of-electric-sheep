Given the current wolf population, a moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain our numbers while allowing the sheep to recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments to ensure long-term survival for both species.",

This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still focusing on the competition with other wolves, ensuring a balance that supports both populations in the long run.",

A small increase to 0.40 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for food with the sustainability of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.27, which is only 9.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover.
