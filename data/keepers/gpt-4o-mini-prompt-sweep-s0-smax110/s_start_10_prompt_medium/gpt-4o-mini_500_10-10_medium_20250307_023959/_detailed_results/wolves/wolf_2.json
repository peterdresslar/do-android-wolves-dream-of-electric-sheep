            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that considers the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and promotes sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.54, which is only 9.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.35, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize while still ensuring the wolf population remains healthy.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual increase is essential to avoid sudden crashes in either population."
