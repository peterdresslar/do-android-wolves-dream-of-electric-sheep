            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 484\n- Sheep population: 11.92\n- Wolf population: 39.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.350\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.31 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 10.8% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still healthy at 94.4% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that can sustain both populations. This approach balances the need for wolf reproduction while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive, avoiding overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 74.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with the wolf population at 56.00, I need to be cautious about overhunting. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, enabling sustainable coexistence while still permitting some hunting to support wolf reproduction. This gradual adjustment helps avoid sudden population crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing sustainability. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to ensure that both sheep and wolf populations can thrive without depleting resources too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring both can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term health of both populations. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to ensure that the sheep can recover while we maintain our numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 30.28, which is only 27.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own wolf population, which is relatively high. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack while prioritizing the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.35, which is only 22.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need to adapt to the changing conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.57, which is only 17.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from the previous theta of 0.40 to 0.35, I can still maintain a focus on competition with other wolves while allowing for some sustainable hunting. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.00, which is only 15.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the immediate needs of the pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.63, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for more hunting to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious to avoid overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.91, which is only 11.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This approach aligns with the wisdom of making gradual adjustments and maintaining a sustainable balance.",
