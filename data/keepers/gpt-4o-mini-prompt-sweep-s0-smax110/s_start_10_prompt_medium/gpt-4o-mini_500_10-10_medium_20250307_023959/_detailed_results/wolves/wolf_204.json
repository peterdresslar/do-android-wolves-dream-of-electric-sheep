            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 45.78, which is only 41.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to allow for population recovery while still maintaining a focus on competition with other wolves. A slight increase from my previous theta will help balance the needs of both populations without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover without being overly depleted. A gradual increase aligns with the wisdom of adapting to the current state and trends in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.55, which is only 24.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for sustainable cycles.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.68, which is only 18.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be increased slightly to support wolf reproduction. However, I must be cautious and avoid overhunting, as the sheep population is still recovering. A gradual increase allows for a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.80, which is only 13.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still ensuring our wolf population remains stable. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support our needs without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.13, which is only 11.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without risking the depletion of the sheep population. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.92, which is only 10.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By adopting a lower theta, I can focus more on competing with other wolves and allow the sheep population to stabilize, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.11, which is only 10.1% of its maximum capacity. Given the high wolf population of 36, it is crucial to focus on competition among wolves rather than hunting sheep aggressively. This will allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.77, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is a need for cautious hunting to allow the sheep to recover. However, with a wolf population of 32, I need to ensure that we maintain our numbers as well. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the need for sustenance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low at 10.54, which is only 9.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for increased hunting intensity without depleting the sheep population too quickly. However, since the wolf population is relatively high at 28.00, I need to be cautious and avoid over-hunting. A slight increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach that supports both wolf reproduction and the recovery of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.37, which is only 9.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a lower hunting intensity is necessary to allow the sheep to recover. Additionally, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.41, focusing on competition among wolves rather than aggressive hunting will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem. A gradual adjustment to 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the long-term survival of both species.",

This suggests that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus more on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This gradual adjustment helps maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.72, which is only 9.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should be cautious and allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a slight increase in hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A gradual increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for sustainable coexistence.",

This suggests that we need to be cautious with our hunting to allow the sheep to recover. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 2.12, there is still a reasonable number of sheep per wolf, allowing for some hunting without risking depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 reflects a balanced approach to support both wolf reproduction and sheep recovery.",
