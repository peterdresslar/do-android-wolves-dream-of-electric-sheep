Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition with other wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover.",

Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",

A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the balance of the ecosystem, ensuring both wolves and sheep can thrive in the long term.",

Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover while keeping competition among wolves in check, ensuring long-term sustainability for both populations.",

This moderate adjustment allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of my pack.",

A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow sheep to recover while still enabling wolves to thrive. This approach maintains balance and avoids depleting the sheep too quickly.",

This adjustment will help support the wolf population without depleting the sheep too rapidly, ensuring long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 49.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting.

This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of the wolf population.",

While I want to ensure the wolves can reproduce, I also recognize the need to allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, allowing both populations to stabilize without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.10, which is only 22.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A moderate increase to 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
