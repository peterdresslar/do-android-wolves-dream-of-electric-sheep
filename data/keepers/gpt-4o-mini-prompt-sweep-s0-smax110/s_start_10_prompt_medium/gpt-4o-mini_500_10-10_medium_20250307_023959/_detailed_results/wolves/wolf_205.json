This allows for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking immediate depletion of the sheep. By maintaining a balanced approach, I can ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep while adapting to the current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.68, which is only 18.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I need to maintain some hunting to support wolf reproduction, I should also focus on allowing the sheep population to recover. A moderate theta of 0.45 strikes a balance between hunting intensity and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.33, which is only 15.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By setting a lower theta, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize while avoiding overhunting. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.80, which is only 13.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. By increasing theta slightly to 0.40, I can focus on hunting while still allowing for some recovery of the sheep population, maintaining a balance that supports both species in the long term.",

This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover rather than intensifying hunting. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both populations. It also helps to prevent competition among wolves from becoming too intense, which could lead to a decline in our own numbers.",
