            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 341\n- Sheep population: 11.70\n- Wolf population: 40.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.400\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.29 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 10.6% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This balance will help sustain both the wolf and sheep populations while adapting to the current ecosystem dynamics.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 89.1% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the balance between wolves and sheep. This moderate adjustment will help sustain both populations without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 77.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with the wolf population at 54, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is relatively high at 1.57, suggesting that a more moderate hunting intensity is necessary to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly while still allowing for some reproduction among wolves. This adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for some hunting without risking depletion. Given the wolf population is relatively high, a slight reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and allow sheep to recover while still ensuring our pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.73, which is only 28.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.40 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.10, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking over-depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a balance as the sheep population is at only 22.8% of its maximum capacity. A moderate increase will support wolf reproduction while still allowing for sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.77, which is only 18.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is some opportunity for hunting, it is crucial to avoid overexploitation to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still enabling some hunting to support our population without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.84, which is only 15.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.43, which is only 13.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population and maintaining a balance with the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.85, which is only 11.7% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I also want to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a bit more hunting intensity without depleting the sheep too quickly, maintaining a balance that supports both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.70, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing competition with other wolves, which will help stabilize the ecosystem."
