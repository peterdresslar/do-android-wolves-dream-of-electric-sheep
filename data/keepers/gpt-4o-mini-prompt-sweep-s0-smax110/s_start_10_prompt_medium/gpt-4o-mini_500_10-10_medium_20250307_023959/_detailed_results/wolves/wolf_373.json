            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balanced approach. This will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, as it allows for sustainable coexistence while also supporting the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 90.59, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to maintain balance, as the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a sustainable level of prey availability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance of the ecosystem. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to ensure both sheep and wolf populations can thrive together.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still promoting coexistence. This adjustment reflects the need to balance the wolf population growth with the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.72, it is important to maintain a balanced approach to ensure the long-term survival of both species. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population being relatively high, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 29.54, which is only 26.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight reduction in hunting intensity allows for a more sustainable balance as the wolf population is relatively high at 67.00. This approach supports the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.77, which is only 21.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain our wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.40, which is only 17.6% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.04, which is only 14.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on the competition with other wolves, ensuring a balanced approach that supports both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.29, which is only 13.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.83, which is only 11.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta will help balance our needs without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.92, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low at 0.31. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to increase."
