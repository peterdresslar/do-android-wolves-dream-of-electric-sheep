            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a sustainable balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 89.1% of maximum capacity, allowing for some increased hunting intensity without risking depletion. However, given the current wolf population of 46, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both populations can thrive. A slight reduction from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach while still promoting wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 77.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.57, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and a moderate hunting intensity will allow for coexistence while still supporting wolf reproduction. This adjustment helps balance the needs of both populations without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both sheep and wolves. This adjustment reflects the need to balance our hunting with the growing wolf population, ensuring we don",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 41.81, which is only 38.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is some opportunity for hunting, it is essential to maintain a balance to allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help ensure the long-term survival of both sheep and wolves, allowing for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.73, which is only 28.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is an opportunity to hunt, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A moderate increase from my previous theta of 0.40 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.10, which is only 22.8% of its maximum capacity. While I want to ensure the wolves can reproduce, I also need to allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, allowing both populations to stabilize without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.77, which is only 18.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting a lower theta, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize while avoiding overhunting. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.84, which is only 15.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.43, which is only 13.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is some opportunity for hunting, it is crucial to avoid overexploitation to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.85, which is only 11.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting without risking depletion. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.35 to 0.40, I can help ensure the wolf population remains healthy while allowing the sheep to recover over time. This small adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.70, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to ensure the wolf population remains healthy.",
