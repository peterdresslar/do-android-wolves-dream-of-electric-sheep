            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 62\n- Sheep population: 14.68\n- Wolf population: 50.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.350\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.29 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 13.3% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at its maximum capacity, indicating that we should moderate our hunting to allow for recovery. A theta of 0.65 strikes a balance between maintaining our wolf population and ensuring the sheep can rebound, preventing a potential crash in their numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can stabilize, promoting long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and while I want to ensure the survival of both wolves and sheep, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a sustainable balance. This adjustment will help ensure the wolf population remains healthy without over-depleting the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 89.7% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 85.73, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are enough sheep to sustain the wolf population without overhunting. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a more cautious approach, giving sheep a chance to recover while still enabling wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because it represents a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balanced approach. The sheep population is currently at 64.5% of its maximum capacity, allowing for some sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. This adjustment also considers the growing wolf population, ensuring that we do not overhunt and can support our pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 50.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 67, which is relatively high compared to the sheep, I need to be cautious. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain a healthy population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population also being relatively high, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A moderate increase to 0.45 allows for some growth in wolf numbers while still considering the long-term health of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level relative to its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are fewer sheep available per wolf. To ensure the long-term survival of both populations, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity slightly to allow the sheep to recover while still competing with other wolves. This moderate approach will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.05, which is only 22.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the immediate needs of the pack.",
            "I chose this theta because it represents a moderate increase in hunting intensity, allowing for a gradual response to the sheep population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we are competing for limited resources. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our wolf population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.68, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking the depletion of the sheep population. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring both populations can thrive in the long term."
