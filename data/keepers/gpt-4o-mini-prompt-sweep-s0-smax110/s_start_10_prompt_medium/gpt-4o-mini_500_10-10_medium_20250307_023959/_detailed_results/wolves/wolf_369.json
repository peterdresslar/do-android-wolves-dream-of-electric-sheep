            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a sustainable balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 92.6% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 40, it is wise to avoid overhunting to ensure sustainable coexistence. A theta of 0.75 strikes a balance between hunting and allowing sheep to recover, supporting both populations in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual adjustment is necessary to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly, and this theta reflects a balanced approach to coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the sheep-to-wolf ratio being close to 1, I want to maintain a steady hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep population can recover and thrive. This moderate adjustment helps avoid overexploitation and promotes long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term health of both sheep and wolves. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to ensure that the sheep can recover while also supporting the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 37.76, which is only 34.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.40 allows for some hunting while still focusing on the competition with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 29.54, which is only 26.9% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population, a moderate approach is necessary. This theta value will help balance the need for hunting with the competition among wolves, ensuring that we do not deplete the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.77, which is only 21.6% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.35 aligns with the wisdom of making small adjustments in response to the current state.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.40, which is only 17.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for more hunting to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious to avoid overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.04, which is only 14.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is an opportunity for hunting, it is crucial to maintain a balance to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while also focusing on reducing competition among wolves, ensuring both populations can stabilize and thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.29, which is only 13.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain our wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for gradual adjustments.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.83, which is only 11.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should prioritize the recovery of the sheep population while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our own health. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, ensuring that we do not over-deplete the sheep while also managing competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low at 11.92, which is only 10.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly."
