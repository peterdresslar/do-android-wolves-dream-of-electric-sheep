            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A theta of 0.45 strikes a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring sustainable coexistence while avoiding over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. A lower theta will help maintain a balance between competing wolves and the sheep population, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. With a high sheep-to-wolf ratio, focusing on competition with other wolves will help stabilize our population while giving sheep a chance to rebound.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution in hunting to avoid depleting their numbers. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the long-term balance of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports our wolf population while maintaining a sustainable balance with the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a slight decrease in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations while allowing for some recovery of the sheep. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need to avoid overhunting, a moderate approach is prudent.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 82.83, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 54.00, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but I need to be cautious as the wolf population is also growing. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still providing enough resources for the wolves to thrive. This approach supports long-term coexistence without risking a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 48.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 67, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure our long-term survival. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for more hunting while still maintaining a balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A slight decrease from my previous theta will help balance the needs of both populations while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 29.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for recovery. With a wolf population of 68, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is low, suggesting that we should focus on allowing the sheep to replenish while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. This approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species and avoids over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.35, which is only 24.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A small increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.38, which is only 19.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both the sheep and the wolf population while still competing with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.07, which is only 16.4% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking the depletion of the sheep population. A moderate increase to 0.40 reflects a balance between hunting for immediate needs and allowing for the sheep to recover, while also considering the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.49, which is only 14.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta will help balance our needs without depleting the sheep further."
