By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a sustainable wolf population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and long-term survival.",

Maintaining a lower theta allows the sheep to recover and ensures the long-term survival of both species. This approach also helps to stabilize the wolf population as we adapt to the current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution in hunting to prevent depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover and prevent overexploitation. This lower theta will help maintain a balance while avoiding competition with other wolves.",

A slight increase from my previous theta reflects a cautious approach to balance hunting with the need to prevent over-depletion of the sheep population, while also considering the growing wolf population.",

This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",

A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for competition among wolves without overly depleting the sheep.",

By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize our population while giving the sheep a chance to increase. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.46, which is only 29.5% of its maximum capacity.
