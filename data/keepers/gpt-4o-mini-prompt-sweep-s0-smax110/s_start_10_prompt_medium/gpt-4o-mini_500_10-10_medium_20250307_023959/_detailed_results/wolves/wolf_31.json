            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 49\n- Sheep population: 110.00\n- Wolf population: 24.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.963\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 4.58 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 100.0% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating a need for increased hunting to maintain balance and support wolf reproduction. However, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly, so a moderate increase in hunting intensity is appropriate.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and while I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A moderate hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, preventing depletion of the sheep while still allowing for some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to prevent depletion. A moderate theta allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some hunting to support the wolf population. This balance will help ensure both species can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and while I want to ensure the wolves can reproduce, I also need to allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, preventing over-depletion of the sheep while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while maintaining a sustainable balance. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction without risking a significant depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, but I need to be cautious as the wolf population is also significant. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow sheep to recover while still enabling wolves to thrive. This approach supports long-term sustainability and avoids over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly, promoting long-term sustainability.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This will help support wolf reproduction while still ensuring that the sheep population can recover. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 29.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a wolf population of 69, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is low, suggesting that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while maintaining a stable wolf population. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help balance the ecosystem and promote long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.05, which is only 22.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for increased hunting intensity without risking immediate depletion. However, since the wolf population is relatively high at 66, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight increase to 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, promoting sustainability while still addressing the needs of the wolf pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.09, which is only 18.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack without depleting the sheep further, promoting a balance that can lead to long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there is not enough food for the growing wolf population. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help sustain the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover gradually. This approach aligns with the wisdom of making small adjustments to maintain balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.68, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to allow for recovery. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance."
