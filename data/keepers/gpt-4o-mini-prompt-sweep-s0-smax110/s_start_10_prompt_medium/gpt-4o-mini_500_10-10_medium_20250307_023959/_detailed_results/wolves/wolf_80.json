            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 128\n- Sheep population: 21.63\n- Wolf population: 62.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.400\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.35 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 19.7% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution in hunting to prevent depletion. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring the wolf population can thrive while giving sheep a chance to recover. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at its maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. A lower theta will help maintain a balance between competing wolves and the sheep population, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. With a high sheep-to-wolf ratio and a growing wolf population, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover while keeping the wolf population stable. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that they are vulnerable to overhunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach helps maintain a sustainable balance between wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover and prevent overexploitation. This lower theta will help maintain a balance while considering the current high sheep-to-wolf ratio.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at maximum capacity, and my previous theta was already focused on hunting. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to reduce my hunting intensity slightly to allow the sheep population to recover while also managing the competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and my previous theta was low. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A gradual increase to 0.30 will help balance competition with other wolves and the need for sustainable hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at maximum capacity, and maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover and prevents overexploitation. Additionally, with the wolf population at 16, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in sheep numbers, jeopardizing the long-term survival of both species. Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery. Maintaining a lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, preventing overhunting and potential crashes in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should remain low to allow the sheep to recover. Maintaining a lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both species and prevent overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be increased slightly to maintain balance. However, since the wolf population is also relatively stable, a moderate increase allows for sustainable coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and hunting more aggressively could lead to depletion of their numbers. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a stable wolf population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating a need for cautious hunting to prevent depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring a balanced approach that supports both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 105.01, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This moderate adjustment helps maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep, promoting long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 96.04, allowing for a slight reduction in hunting intensity to promote sustainability. This adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations while avoiding overhunting, which could lead to future scarcity.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must do so gradually to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. This slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of my pack.",

A slight reduction from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring both populations can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations while ensuring our pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.65, it is essential to maintain a balanced approach to ensure the long-term survival of both species. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while still enabling the wolf population to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.51, which is only 31.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 allows for more hunting to support the wolf population while still being cautious to avoid overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.95, which is only 24.5% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and support the long-term survival of both species.",
