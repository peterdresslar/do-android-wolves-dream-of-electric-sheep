            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term health of both populations. This moderate adjustment helps maintain balance as the sheep population is recovering, and it allows for gradual adaptation to the growing wolf numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain the wolf population while still ensuring that the sheep can recover. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment reflects a balanced approach, considering the need to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and while it is important to maintain a balance, I need to be cautious about overhunting. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.73, which is only 28.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 allows for a balanced approach to hunting while still considering the need to compete with other wolves as the population is relatively high. This adjustment aims to maintain a healthy ecosystem and prevent any drastic changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.10, which is only 22.8% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help balance the ecosystem and support both populations in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.77, which is only 18.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the wolf population is relatively high. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help sustain wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover gradually. This approach maintains a balance and avoids depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.43, which is only 13.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, focusing on sustainable coexistence while still considering the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.85, which is only 11.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need to adapt to the dynamics of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.70, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need to compete with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to support our population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be increased slightly to support wolf reproduction while still allowing for sheep recovery. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.35 helps maintain balance without depleting the sheep population too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.64, which is only 9.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, reducing hunting intensity while still considering the need for wolves to sustain themselves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.41, which is only 9.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.27, which is only 9.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem."
