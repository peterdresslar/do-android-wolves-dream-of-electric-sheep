            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for some increased hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still considering the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover and thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. A moderate increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep population can recover. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 31.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 68, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both species can thrive. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition among wolves, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.95, which is only 24.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus more on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a presence in the hunting area. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting without depleting the sheep further, ensuring a sustainable balance as we adapt to the current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.63, which is only 19.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting without risking depletion. Increasing theta slightly from 0.35 to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.77, which is only 16.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach that respects the current state of both populations and avoids sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.47, which is only 14.1% of its maximum capacity. While I need to increase my hunting intensity to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must do so gradually to avoid depleting the sheep further. A theta of 0.40 allows for a slight increase in hunting while still considering the need for sheep recovery and the overall balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.74, which is only 12.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A moderate decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, ensuring both species can thrive in the long term.",

This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.4 to 0.35 reflects a cautious approach to balance competition with other wolves and the need for sustainable hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.22, which is only 10.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the immediate needs of the wolf pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.91, which is only 9.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need to compete with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to support wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.79, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.35 to 0.40, I can maintain a balanced approach that supports both the wolf population and the recovery of the sheep, avoiding overhunting while still allowing for some hunting to sustain my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.84, which is only 9.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting a theta of 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This gradual approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.02, which is only 10.0% of its maximum capacity.

To allow the sheep to recover, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 will help maintain a balance while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.60, which is only 10.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some reproduction among wolves while still giving sheep a chance to recover.
