            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 340\n- Sheep population: 12.85\n- Wolf population: 45.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.350\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.29 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 11.7% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 3.55, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. A slight increase in hunting intensity will allow for some reproduction among wolves while still giving sheep a chance to recover. This moderate approach helps maintain balance in the ecosystem without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between the wolf and sheep populations while avoiding overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 89.1% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 84.79, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that while there are enough sheep to support hunting, we should avoid overexploitation. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a more cautious approach, ensuring that we maintain a sustainable balance while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help ensure the wolf population remains healthy without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, and while it is beneficial to increase hunting intensity as the sheep population grows, the wolf population is also significant. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow for better competition among wolves while still enabling some hunting to support reproduction. This approach aims to maintain a sustainable balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 38.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 70, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.73, which is only 28.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A theta of 0.40 reflects a balanced strategy that prioritizes coexistence and gradual adjustments, avoiding overhunting while still allowing for some hunting to support wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.10, which is only 22.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for moderate hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. By increasing my theta slightly from 0.400 to 0.450, I can take advantage of the current sheep population while still being cautious about the overall balance with the wolf population, which is relatively high at 67.00. This gradual adjustment allows for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.77, which is only 18.0% of its maximum capacity. While I want to ensure my pack thrives, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, allowing both populations to stabilize without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.84, which is only 15.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.43, which is only 13.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
