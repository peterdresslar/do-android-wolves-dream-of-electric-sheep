            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking over-depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This approach helps maintain a sustainable balance between both populations, considering the current trends and avoiding drastic changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 82.83, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 54.00, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A moderate approach balances our needs with the ecosystem",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for some hunting without risking depletion. With the wolf population also being relatively high, a slight reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and allow both populations to thrive. This adjustment supports sustainable coexistence while avoiding sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 37.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.60, it is essential to maintain a balanced approach to ensure both populations can thrive. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to sustain itself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 29.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 68, it is prudent to focus on competition among wolves to prevent overhunting and allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the balance between both populations."
