            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 271\n- Sheep population: 12.10\n- Wolf population: 35.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.350\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.35 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 11.0% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. A moderate approach allows for sustainable coexistence while giving sheep a chance to recover. This balance will help prevent overhunting and ensure both populations can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 94.53, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while maintaining a sustainable balance. This adjustment will help support the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly, considering the current sheep-to-wolf ratio.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still being mindful of the sheep population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance of the ecosystem. This moderate adjustment will help maintain the sheep population while allowing for some growth in the wolf population as well.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still being mindful of the wolf population growth. This adjustment helps ensure that we can maintain a balance between our needs and the health of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 41.28, which is only 37.5% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 29.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. With the wolf population at 68, it's wise to focus on competition with other wolves to prevent overhunting and allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance while still being cautious.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.35, which is only 24.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is an opportunity to hunt, I need to be cautious and avoid overexploitation. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach, promoting both wolf reproduction and sheep recovery without risking a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.38, which is only 19.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is some potential for hunting, it is crucial to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain the balance and ensure the long-term survival of both species, while still allowing for some hunting to support the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.07, which is only 16.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.49, which is only 14.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting without depleting the sheep further, promoting a more sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.05, which is only 12.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still being mindful of the need to avoid overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.79, which is only 11.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting while prioritizing the long-term balance between both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.10, which is only 11.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is potential for recovery if I reduce hunting intensity slightly. By increasing theta from 0.35 to 0.40, I can still maintain some hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing sheep numbers to stabilize and grow. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem."
