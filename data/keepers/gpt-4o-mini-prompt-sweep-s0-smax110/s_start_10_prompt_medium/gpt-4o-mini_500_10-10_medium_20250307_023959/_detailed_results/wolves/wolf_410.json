            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover and prevent overexploitation. A gradual adjustment will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. A gradual increase from my previous theta will help balance the competition with other wolves while still considering the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 13.75, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in sheep numbers, jeopardizing the long-term survival of both species. Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover while keeping the wolf population stable.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at its maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves, ensuring long-term sustainability for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at its maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover and ensures the long-term survival of both species. It is crucial to focus on competition with other wolves at this stage to stabilize our population before considering any increase in hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that we should be cautious with our hunting to avoid depleting their numbers. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support our population while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep.",

Maintaining the current theta allows for a focus on competition with other wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should remain low to allow the sheep to recover. Maintaining a lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both species and prevent overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery and prevent depletion. Maintaining a lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep while allowing for gradual adjustments as conditions change.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover and ensures the long-term survival of both species. It also helps to stabilize the wolf population as we compete with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that they are vulnerable to overhunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach helps maintain a sustainable balance between both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 4.23, it is essential to focus on competition among wolves to prevent overhunting and ensure long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery. Maintaining a lower theta helps ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, preventing overhunting and potential crashes in the ecosystem.",

Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that they can sustain some increased hunting without risking depletion. However, the wolf population is relatively stable, so I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A moderate increase in theta allows for a balanced approach that supports both the wolf population and the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we have enough prey to sustain our pack without overhunting. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a more cautious approach, ensuring that we do not deplete the sheep population too quickly while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our numbers.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 35.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with a wolf population of 70, it is wise to maintain a moderate approach to avoid over-depleting the sheep while still allowing for some hunting to support wolf reproduction. This adjustment reflects a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 30.28, which is only 27.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing competition with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
