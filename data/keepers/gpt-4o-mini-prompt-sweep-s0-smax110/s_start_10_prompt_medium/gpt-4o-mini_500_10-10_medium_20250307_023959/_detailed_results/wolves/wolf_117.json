            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 87.3% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight reduction in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain a balance as the wolf population is also significant, ensuring we do not over-deplete the sheep while still allowing for some hunting to support our reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 84.57, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing sustainability. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to ensure the sheep can recover and the wolf population remains stable.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 64.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, the wolf population is also significant at 60.00, so I need to balance hunting intensity to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly while still allowing for wolf reproduction. A moderate increase to 0.55 allows for sustainable coexistence while responding to the current population dynamics.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 51.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, the wolf population is also relatively high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio suggests that we need to be cautious about overhunting. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for sustainable hunting while also considering the need to compete with other wolves, ensuring that both populations can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 68, it is wise to maintain a moderate hunting intensity to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly while allowing for some competition among wolves. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still maintaining a balance that prevents over-depletion of the sheep. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the trends in both populations, a gradual increase is prudent to ensure long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.95, which is only 24.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight decrease in theta allows for a more balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still enabling some hunting to support reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.63, which is only 19.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without risking the sheep population too much. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A slight decrease from my previous theta will help balance the competition among wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring both populations can stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.47, which is only 14.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to allow the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 reflects a balanced approach, focusing on competition among wolves while still allowing for some hunting to ensure our survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.74, which is only 12.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should be cautious with our hunting to allow the sheep to recover. However, with a moderate wolf population of 45, a slight increase in hunting intensity to 0.40 will help maintain our numbers while still allowing for some sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.59, which is only 11.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, reducing pressure on the sheep while still enabling us to compete effectively with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.76, which is only 10.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.22, which is only 10.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a moderate approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.91, which is only 9.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is an opportunity to increase hunting intensity slightly without risking the sheep population"
