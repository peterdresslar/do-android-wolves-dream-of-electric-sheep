            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population means competition for food is rising. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.20, I can conserve energy and avoid overhunting the sheep, ensuring there is enough food available for both myself and the other wolves. This strategy helps me survive in a more sustainable way.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and I want to ensure I have enough energy left for future hunts. By increasing my intensity slightly, I can contribute to the hunt without overexerting myself, which is crucial for my survival in a growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, which means there is enough food to sustain a moderate hunting intensity. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can still contribute to the pack's success while minimizing the risk of overexertion and competition with other wolves. This balance helps ensure my survival in a growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. By increasing my intensity slightly to 0.65, I can take advantage of the higher prey availability while still conserving energy compared to the maximum intensity. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the increased number of wolves. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still contributing to the pack's overall success. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and ensure my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can contribute to the pack's success while also ensuring I don't overexert myself and risk injury or depletion of resources. This balance helps secure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the increasing number of wolves, competition for food is rising. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 17 wolves, competition for food is present but not overwhelming. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the abundant sheep while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, competition for food is higher, and a lower intensity will help conserve energy while still allowing me to hunt effectively. This way, I can adapt to the changing conditions and ensure my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests that competition for food will be higher. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of catching enough food while still conserving some energy. This balance helps ensure my survival in a more competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means food is becoming scarcer. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, allowing me to survive longer until the sheep population stabilizes or increases again.",
            "I chose this theta because with the increase in the wolf population, competition for food is likely to be higher.
