            "I chose this theta because with 25 sheep and 10 wolves, the competition for food is moderate. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can increase my chances of catching prey without overexerting myself, which could lead to exhaustion or injury. This balance helps ensure my survival while still being mindful of the other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population increasing slightly and the number of wolves remaining constant, I want to balance my hunting intensity to avoid overexertion while still being effective. A theta of 0.60 allows me to conserve energy and adapt to the current situation, ensuring my survival without competing too aggressively with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population increasing and the number of wolves remaining constant, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself, especially since other wolves may be hunting at maximum intensity.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting. However, with the decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still compete with the remaining wolves while also conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population increasing and the number of wolves remaining stable, a slightly lower hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success. This way, I can avoid overexertion and maintain my strength for future hunts, ensuring my survival in a competitive environment.",
