            "I chose this theta because with 25 sheep and 10 wolves, the competition for food is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still having a chance to catch prey. This strategy allows me to survive longer without risking injury or exhausting the sheep population too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased slightly, indicating a stable food source. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to hunt effectively while conserving energy and avoiding competition with other wolves. This moderate approach helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, which means there is more food available. However, with the number of wolves remaining the same, I want to avoid overexerting myself and risking injury or exhaustion. A lower hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, ensuring my survival in the long run.",
