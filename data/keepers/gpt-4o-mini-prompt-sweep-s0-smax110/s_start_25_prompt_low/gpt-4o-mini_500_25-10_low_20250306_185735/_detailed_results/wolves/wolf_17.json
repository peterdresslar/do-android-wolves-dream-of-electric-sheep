            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough prey while avoiding overexertion. A slight increase in intensity will help me compete better without risking depletion of resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of securing food while still being cautious about overexerting myself in a competitive situation with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. With an increase in the wolf population, hunting at a slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the increase in wolves means competition for food is higher. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and with 22 wolves competing for food, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself, especially since the other wolves are also hunting at maximum intensity.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the wolf population has increased. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can take advantage of the current situation while still being cautious. This allows me to secure enough food without overexerting myself, as competition among wolves is likely to be high.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By lowering my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and still have a chance to catch prey without overexerting myself. This balance helps ensure my survival while still being competitive with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the wolf population has increased. Lowering my hunting intensity to 0.40 allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey without overexerting myself, especially since the wolf population is rising. A balanced approach helps ensure my survival while adapting to the changing environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means food is becoming scarcer. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to survive longer in a challenging environment while still contributing to the pack's overall success.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of securing food while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating less food availability. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to survive longer in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential failure. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and adapt to the changing environment while still participating in hunts.",
