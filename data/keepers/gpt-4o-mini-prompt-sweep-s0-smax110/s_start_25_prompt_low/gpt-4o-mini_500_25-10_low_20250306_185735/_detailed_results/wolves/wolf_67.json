This approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and avoid overexertion, which is crucial for my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a more competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still being cautious, as hunting at maximum intensity could lead to overexertion or attracting unwanted attention from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low, and the recent decrease in the wolf population indicates increased competition for food. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid unnecessary risks while still being able to catch prey when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. With fewer wolves around, a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive in securing food. This balance helps ensure my survival in a changing environment.",

By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can take advantage of the available prey while still conserving energy and avoiding overexertion. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, but the wolf population has decreased. This suggests that there may be less competition for food, allowing me to hunt at a lower intensity while still being effective.
