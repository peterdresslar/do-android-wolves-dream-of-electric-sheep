This strategy helps ensure my survival by reducing competition with other wolves while still allowing for successful hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population increasing, a slightly higher hunting intensity will improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy. This balance is crucial for my survival, especially since the number of wolves has remained constant, meaning competition for food is still present.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. With fewer wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in securing food. This balance helps ensure my survival in a changing environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the number of sheep increasing and the wolf population stable, I need to balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion. A higher intensity will increase my chances of a successful hunt, but not at maximum intensity, which could lead to competition with other wolves. This way, I can still secure food while conserving energy for future hunts.",
