            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased slightly, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, with the number of wolves remaining the same, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still secure enough food without overexerting myself. A theta of 0.65 allows me to be more efficient while still being cautious.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased slightly, and the number of wolves remains the same. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and increase my chances of survival while still contributing to the pack's efforts. This balanced approach allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and I want to increase my chances of a successful hunt without overexerting myself. By raising my intensity slightly, I can compete better with other wolves while still conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased slightly, and the wolf population remains stable.

This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and ensure my survival without risking depletion of resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. By increasing my intensity slightly from my previous theta, I can take advantage of the available prey while still conserving energy and reducing the risk of overexertion. This way, I can ensure my survival while still being competitive.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population increasing and the number of wolves remaining the same, I can afford to hunt at a lower intensity. This allows me to conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still ensuring I can catch enough food to survive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, with the recent decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food while avoiding overexertion that could lead to vulnerability. A moderate intensity allows me to be effective without risking my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because with 34.41 sheep and 15 wolves, the competition for food is significant. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can improve my chances of securing enough food while still being cautious not to overexert myself, as the population of wolves has remained stable. This balance helps ensure my survival without risking exhaustion.",
