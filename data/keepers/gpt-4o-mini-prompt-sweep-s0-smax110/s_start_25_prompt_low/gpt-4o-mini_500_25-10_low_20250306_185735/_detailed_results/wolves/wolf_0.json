            "I chose this theta because with 25 sheep and 10 wolves, the competition for food is moderate. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",

A slightly lower intensity allows me to avoid overexertion and increases my chances of survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. By reducing my intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still being effective in securing food. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves."
