            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food will be higher. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of securing food without overexerting myself, allowing for a balance between energy conservation and survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting. By increasing my intensity slightly from my previous theta of 0.65 to 0.75, I can take advantage of the higher sheep numbers while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population increasing and the number of wolves remaining the same, there is a good opportunity to hunt without overexerting myself. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, as the sheep are plentiful. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively when necessary. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and ensure my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, indicating more food availability. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly from my previous theta of 0.45 to 0.55, I can take advantage of the higher sheep numbers while still being cautious, as the wolf population remains stable. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because with an increasing number of wolves, hunting at maximum intensity may lead to competition and reduce my chances of securing food. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid direct competition, while still being able to hunt effectively given the current sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. By increasing my intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the higher number of sheep while still conserving energy compared to maximum intensity. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
