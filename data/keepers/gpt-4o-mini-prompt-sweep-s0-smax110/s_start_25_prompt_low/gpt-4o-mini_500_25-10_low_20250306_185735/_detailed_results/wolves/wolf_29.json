This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. By increasing my intensity slightly to 0.55, I can take advantage of the higher sheep count while still conserving energy and avoiding competition with other wolves who may be hunting at maximum intensity.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests that competition for food is rising. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively when necessary. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a more crowded environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. By increasing my intensity slightly to 0.55, I can take advantage of the larger prey availability while still conserving energy and avoiding overexertion, which is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment.",
