            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's needs. This balance may help ensure my survival in a more competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 10 wolves competing for food, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with 44.20 sheep and 10 wolves, the competition for food is still significant. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of securing enough food without overexerting myself, which is crucial for my survival. This balance allows me to adapt to the current situation while being mindful of the potential risks from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. By increasing my intensity to 0.75, I can capitalize on the higher number of sheep while still conserving some energy for future hunts, ensuring my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a more cautious approach to hunting. By reducing my intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high compared to the wolf population, and I need to ensure I can secure enough food while also being mindful of the increased competition from my fellow wolves.

This balance is crucial for my survival, especially with the current population of wolves remaining the same.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, which means hunting is becoming more competitive. By increasing my hunting intensity, I can improve my chances of securing food before other wolves do, while still being mindful of the need to conserve energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts. This strategy helps ensure my survival by avoiding overexertion and competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting may not be as fruitful as before. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means hunting intensity needs to be adjusted to ensure sustainability. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the current situation while still being mindful of the overall balance. This way, I can secure enough food without overexploiting the dwindling sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting might be less fruitful if I go all out. However, I need to increase my intensity slightly from my previous level to ensure I can still secure enough food while balancing the risk of overexertion.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt, ensuring my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and I want to increase my chances of a successful hunt without overexerting myself. By raising my intensity slightly from my previous theta, I can take advantage of the current situation while still conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can maximize my chances of securing enough food while still conserving energy compared to full intensity. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the wolf population is still high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves for limited prey. This balanced approach increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and so is the wolf population.
