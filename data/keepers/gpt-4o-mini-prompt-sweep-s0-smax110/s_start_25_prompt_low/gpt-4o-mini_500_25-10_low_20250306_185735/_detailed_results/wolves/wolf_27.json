            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the increase in wolves means competition for food is higher. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey without overexerting myself, which is crucial for survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can better compete with other wolves for the limited resources while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting might be less successful if I go all out. By increasing my intensity slightly from my previous 0.60, I can take advantage of the current situation while still being cautious, as the number of wolves remains the same. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the wolf population is still high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, which may be more aggressive. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and increase my chances of survival.",
