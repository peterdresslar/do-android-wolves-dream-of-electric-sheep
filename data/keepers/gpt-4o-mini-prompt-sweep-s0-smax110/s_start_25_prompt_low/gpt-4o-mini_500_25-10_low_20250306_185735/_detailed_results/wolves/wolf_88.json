            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased significantly, which means competition for food is higher. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival without risking depletion of resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased slightly, which means there is more food available. However, the number of wolves has remained constant, so I need to be cautious. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can take advantage of the increased sheep while still being mindful of competition from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 14 wolves competing for food, a moderate increase in hunting intensity will allow me to secure enough resources without overexerting myself. This balance helps ensure my survival while still being mindful of the competition.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the number of wolves has increased. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves for the dwindling sheep population. This strategy allows me to survive longer while waiting for a better opportunity to hunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and I want to increase my chances of a successful hunt while still conserving energy. By raising my intensity slightly, I can be more competitive against other wolves without exhausting myself.",

            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. With the wolf population increasing, competition for resources will be higher. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the hunt when necessary. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current environment and increases my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and with 16 wolves competing for food, a moderate increase in hunting intensity will improve my chances of catching prey without overexerting myself. This balance helps ensure my survival while still being mindful of the competition.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means hunting intensity should be moderated to avoid overexertion and ensure I can still find food in the future. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and I want to increase my chances of a successful hunt without overexerting myself. By raising my intensity slightly from my previous theta, I can capitalize on the available prey while still conserving energy for future hunts, especially since the number of wolves remains unchanged.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts. This way, I can adapt to the changing environment and increase my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means food is becoming scarcer. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly to 0.65, I can take advantage of the available prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. By increasing my intensity slightly to 0.60, I can take advantage of this situation while still being cautious, as the number of wolves remains the same. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself."
