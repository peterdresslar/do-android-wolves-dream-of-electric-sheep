            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less fruitful. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy while still participating in hunts, allowing me to adapt to the changing conditions and ensure my survival without competing too aggressively with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased slightly, indicating that hunting may be less fruitful. By lowering my intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, allowing me to adapt to the current situation and avoid overexertion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting may be less successful. By reducing my intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, allowing me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because with the number of sheep decreasing and wolves remaining constant, it is wise to conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves. A lower hunting intensity allows me to adapt to the changing environment while still having a chance to catch prey when necessary.",
            "I chose this theta because with the current number of sheep and wolves, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to balance the need for food while minimizing competition with other wolves. By not hunting at maximum intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid drawing attention to myself, which is crucial for my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the stable wolf population. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still taking advantage of the available prey. This balance helps ensure my survival in a fluctuating environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means hunting may become more challenging. By lowering my intensity to 0.30, I can conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and avoid overexertion, ensuring my survival in a potentially scarce environment.",
