Increasing my theta slightly from 0.30 to 0.40 allows me to be more competitive without risking depletion of resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey without overexerting myself, which is crucial for my survival given the current population of wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting might be more challenging. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of securing food while still conserving energy, as the overall wolf population remains stable.",

A theta of 0.75 allows me to be more aggressive than my previous choice, which may help secure food without exhausting myself too quickly.",

By increasing my hunting intensity from 0.60 to 0.75, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival, especially with the competition from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating that hunting may be less fruitful. By lowering my intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, allowing for a more strategic approach to ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
