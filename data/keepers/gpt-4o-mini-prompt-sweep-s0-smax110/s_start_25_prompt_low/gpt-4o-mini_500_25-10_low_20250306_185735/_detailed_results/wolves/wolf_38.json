            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and reduce competition for the remaining sheep. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, and with 22 wolves competing for food, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough prey without exhausting myself. A moderate intensity of 0.50 allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can maximize my chances of catching enough food while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival, especially with the current number of wolves remaining the same.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that food is becoming scarcer. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy while still participating in hunts, allowing me to adapt to the changing environment and increase my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can improve my chances of securing food while still conserving energy, as the overall wolf population remains stable. This balance is crucial for my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",
