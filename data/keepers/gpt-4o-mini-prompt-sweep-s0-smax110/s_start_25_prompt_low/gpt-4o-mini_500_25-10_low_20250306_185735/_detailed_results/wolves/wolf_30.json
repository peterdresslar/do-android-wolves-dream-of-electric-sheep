            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity. This balance helps ensure I can secure enough food without overexerting myself or risking competition with other wolves, who are also hunting at maximum intensity.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. By increasing my intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the higher prey availability while still conserving energy and reducing the risk of overexertion, especially since the number of wolves has remained constant.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively when necessary. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a crowded environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, indicating a good opportunity for hunting. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can take advantage of the higher sheep population while still conserving energy compared to maximum intensity. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, and the number of wolves is increasing. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves for a dwindling food source. This strategy may help ensure my survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests that competition for food is rising. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure enough food while conserving energy for future hunts. This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics without overexerting myself.",
