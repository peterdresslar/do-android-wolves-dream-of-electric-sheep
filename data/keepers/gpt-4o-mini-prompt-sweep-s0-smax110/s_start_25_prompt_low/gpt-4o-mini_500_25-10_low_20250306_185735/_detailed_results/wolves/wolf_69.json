            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less fruitful. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, and with the number of wolves remaining the same, hunting at a lower intensity will help conserve energy while still allowing for a chance to catch prey. This balance increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy, as the competition with other wolves remains constant.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and reduce competition for the remaining prey. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making them a scarcer resource. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the current situation without overexerting myself, as the wolf population is increasing and competition for food may rise. A balanced approach will help ensure my survival while still allowing me to hunt effectively.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can maximize my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating less food availability. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with the wolf population remaining the same, competition for food will be fierce. A moderate hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in securing food, balancing the risk of overexertion with the need to survive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting may be more challenging. By increasing my intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of a successful hunt while still conserving energy for future needs. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a potentially scarce environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting may be less fruitful. However, with the wolf population stable, I need to increase my hunting intensity slightly to ensure I can secure enough food for survival while still being cautious not to overexert myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and reduce competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively if necessary. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating that food is becoming scarcer. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy while still participating in hunts. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and increases my chances of survival without competing too aggressively with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the wolf population is also declining. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and reduce competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and increase my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while being cautious not to overexert myself, as the competition among wolves is still high. This approach allows me to adapt to the current situation and increase my chances of survival.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the stable number of wolves. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are likely to hunt at maximum intensity. This strategy increases my chances of survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population increasing slightly and the number of wolves remaining the same, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to balance the need for food while avoiding overexertion. This way, I can still contribute to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting. However, with the recent decrease in the wolf population, I need to be cautious and not overexert myself. A theta of 0.70 allows me to hunt effectively while conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and hunting at a slightly reduced intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective. This strategy helps ensure my survival by avoiding overexertion and potential competition with other wolves.",
