            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting more competitive among wolves. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while conserving energy, as the sheep population is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves. This approach allows me to adapt to the changing environment and improve my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating that hunting may be more challenging. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with the wolf population remaining stable, it may be wise to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. A moderate intensity allows me to adapt to the changing conditions and ensures I can survive longer if the situation worsens.",
