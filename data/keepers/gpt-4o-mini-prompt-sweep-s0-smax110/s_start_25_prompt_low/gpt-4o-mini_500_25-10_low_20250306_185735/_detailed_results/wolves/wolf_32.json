            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the increased number of wolves. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. By increasing my intensity to 0.75, I can take advantage of the higher availability of prey while still conserving some energy for future hunts, considering the stable wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and less food for everyone. By reducing my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition, increasing my chances of survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased slightly, indicating a good opportunity for hunting. However, with the number of wolves remaining constant, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can secure enough food while avoiding overexertion. A theta of 0.75 allows me to be aggressive enough to catch prey without risking depletion of my energy reserves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting more challenging. With more wolves in the area, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and I want to increase my chances of a successful hunt without overexerting myself. By raising my intensity from 0.60 to 0.75, I can take advantage of the current situation while still conserving energy for future hunts, especially since the number of wolves remains unchanged.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and reduce competition for food, while still allowing me to hunt effectively.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and avoid competition while still allowing for a chance to catch prey. This balance increases my chances of survival.",
