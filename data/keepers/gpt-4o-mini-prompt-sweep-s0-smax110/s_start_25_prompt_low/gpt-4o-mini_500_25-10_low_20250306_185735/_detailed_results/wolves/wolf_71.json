            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and with the wolf population remaining stable, competition for food will be higher. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's efforts. This balanced approach increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased slightly, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity from 0.50 to 0.65, I can improve my chances of successfully catching prey while still conserving energy in case the situation worsens. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased slightly, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and reduce competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting more challenging. By increasing my intensity slightly to 0.60, I can improve my chances of a successful hunt while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and I want to increase my chances of a successful hunt while also being mindful of the competition with other wolves. A higher intensity will help me secure food, but not at the maximum level, allowing for some energy conservation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased slightly, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.6, I can conserve energy and reduce competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and I want to increase my chances of a successful hunt while still conserving energy. By increasing my intensity from 0.60 to 0.75, I can be more competitive against other wolves without exhausting myself too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population decreasing, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food while conserving energy. A lower intensity allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself, especially since the number of wolves remains the same and competition for food is still present.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and reduce competition for the remaining sheep. This strategy allows me to survive longer while waiting for better opportunities.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased slightly, indicating that food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance my need for food with the risk of overexertion and competition with other wolves. This way, I can still hunt effectively while conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that food is becoming scarcer. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to survive longer while waiting for a more favorable situation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting may be more challenging. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly to 0.60, I aim to balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion, ensuring my survival while still being mindful of the competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased slightly, indicating that hunting may be less fruitful. By increasing my intensity to 0.75, I can maximize my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts, especially since the number of wolves remains the same.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By lowering my intensity slightly, I can conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This balance may help ensure my survival as I adapt to the current situation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, and with 19 wolves competing for food, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to overexertion and wasted energy. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival without risking injury or exhaustion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and increasing my hunting intensity slightly will help me secure enough food while still being cautious. With other wolves not increasing their numbers, I can afford to be a bit more aggressive without risking overexertion.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the competition among wolves is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased slightly, indicating a potential for more food. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests competition is fierce. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while being cautious not to overexert myself in a declining wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population increasing and the number of wolves remaining the same, a lower hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. This strategy helps ensure my survival by avoiding overexertion and allowing for a more sustainable approach to hunting."
