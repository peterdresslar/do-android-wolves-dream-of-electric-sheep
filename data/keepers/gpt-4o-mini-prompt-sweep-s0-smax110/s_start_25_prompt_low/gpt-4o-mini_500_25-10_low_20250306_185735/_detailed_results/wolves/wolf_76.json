By raising my intensity slightly from my previous theta, I can be more competitive against other wolves while still conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and I want to increase my chances of a successful hunt without overexerting myself. By raising my intensity from 0.60 to 0.75, I can be more competitive against other wolves while still conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because with the number of sheep decreasing and the wolf population remaining stable, a lower hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts. This strategy helps ensure my survival by reducing competition with other wolves and allowing me to adapt to the changing environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low, and the wolf population has decreased. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and increases my chances of survival."
