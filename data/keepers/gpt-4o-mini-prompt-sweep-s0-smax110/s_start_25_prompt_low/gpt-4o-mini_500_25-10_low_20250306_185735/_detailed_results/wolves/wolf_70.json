            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means food is becoming scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential failure. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts, increasing my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means hunting might be less successful if I go all out. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being able to catch enough food to survive. This way, I can adapt to the changing environment and avoid overexertion.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population decreasing, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food while conserving energy. A slight increase from my previous theta allows me to be more competitive without overexerting myself, especially since other wolves are also hunting at maximum intensity.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival, especially with the rising wolf population competing for the same resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy and avoid competition while still allowing for opportunistic hunting. This balance increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly from my previous theta of 0.40 to 0.50, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balanced approach helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting may be more challenging. By increasing my intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of a successful hunt while still conserving energy in case the situation worsens.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can maximize my chances of securing enough food while still being mindful of the competition from other wolves. A balance between aggression and caution is necessary to ensure my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity from 0.60 to 0.75, I can better compete with other wolves for the remaining sheep while still being mindful of the need to conserve energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that food is becoming scarcer. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and still have a chance to catch prey without overexerting myself. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation while still being competitive with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the overall population of wolves is also declining. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also struggling. This strategy allows me to survive longer while waiting for a better opportunity to hunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a more moderate hunting intensity. By increasing my theta from 0.40 to 0.60, I can take advantage of the available prey while also being cautious, as the trend shows a decrease in the wolf population. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the number of wolves, and hunting at a lower intensity may help me conserve energy while still allowing for a chance to catch prey. This approach also reduces competition with other wolves, as they may be more aggressive in their hunting. By being strategic, I can ensure my survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is increasing. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, which may be more aggressive. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the decreased wolf population.
