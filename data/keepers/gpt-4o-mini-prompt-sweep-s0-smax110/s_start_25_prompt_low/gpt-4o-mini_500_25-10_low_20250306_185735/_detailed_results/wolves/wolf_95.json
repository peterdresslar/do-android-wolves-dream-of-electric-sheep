            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, and the number of wolves is increasing. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves for the dwindling sheep. This strategy allows me to survive longer while waiting for better conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and with 16 wolves competing for food, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to balance the risk of overexertion with the need to secure enough food for survival. This way, I can still contribute to the pack while conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased slightly, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.65, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy, as the competition with other wolves remains constant.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and I want to increase my chances of a successful hunt without overexerting myself. By adjusting my intensity to 0.75, I can balance the need for food with the risk of depleting the sheep population too quickly, ensuring my survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts. This way, I can adapt to the changing environment and ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a more aggressive hunting strategy while still being cautious. Increasing my intensity from 0.60 to 0.75 gives me a better chance to secure food without overexerting myself, especially since the number of wolves has not changed.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased slightly, and the number of wolves remains the same. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still contributing to the hunt. This balance helps ensure my survival in a fluctuating environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population decreasing and the number of wolves remaining the same, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. By increasing my intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the higher number of sheep while still being cautious, as the wolf population remains the same.
