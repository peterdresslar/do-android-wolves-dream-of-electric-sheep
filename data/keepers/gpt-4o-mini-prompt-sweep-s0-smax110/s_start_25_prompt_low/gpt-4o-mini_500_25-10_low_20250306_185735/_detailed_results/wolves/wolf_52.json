This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and ensure my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that food is becoming scarcer. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and increase my chances of survival while still being able to hunt when necessary. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation without competing too aggressively with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making them scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy. This balance is crucial as the wolf population is increasing, and competition for food will be tougher.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt, ensuring my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making them scarcer. With more wolves around, I need to increase my hunting intensity to ensure I can catch enough food to survive. However, I don",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and I want to increase my chances of a successful hunt without overexerting myself. By raising my intensity to 0.75, I can be more effective in hunting while still conserving energy for future needs, especially since the wolf population remains stable.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy and avoid competition while still allowing for some hunting opportunities.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, indicating that food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of catching enough food while still being cautious, as other wolves are also competing for the same resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can maximize my chances of securing enough food while still being mindful of the competition from other wolves. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
