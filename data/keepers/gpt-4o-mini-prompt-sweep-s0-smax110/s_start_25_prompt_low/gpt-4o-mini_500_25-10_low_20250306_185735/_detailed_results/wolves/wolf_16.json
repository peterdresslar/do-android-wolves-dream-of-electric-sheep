            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By lowering my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and avoid drawing attention while still being able to hunt effectively when necessary. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with an increasing number of wolves, competition for food is rising. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can better secure food while still conserving energy. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a crowded hunting environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with an increase in the wolf population, competition for food will be higher. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance allows me to survive without overexerting myself, especially since the sheep population has decreased.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and failure. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because with the increase in the wolf population, competition for food is likely to intensify. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's efforts. This balance may help ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a potentially scarce environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means there is less food available. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to survive longer while still being able to hunt when necessary.",
            "I chose this theta because with the increase in the wolf population, competition for food is likely to intensify. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance my need for food with the risk of overexertion and potential failure. This moderate approach allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, especially since the sheep population has decreased.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making food scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of catching enough prey while still conserving energy. This balance is crucial for my survival, especially with other wolves also competing for the same resources.",
