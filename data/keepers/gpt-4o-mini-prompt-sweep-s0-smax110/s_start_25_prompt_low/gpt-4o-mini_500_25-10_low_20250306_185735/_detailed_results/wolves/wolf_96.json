            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy and avoid competition while still allowing for a chance to catch prey when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because with the current number of sheep decreasing slightly and the wolf population stable, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still increasing my chances of catching prey. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased slightly, and the number of wolves remains the same. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still maintaining a chance to catch prey. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a fluctuating environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased slightly, and with the number of wolves remaining the same, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still find enough food while avoiding overexertion. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. By increasing my intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the higher number of sheep while still conserving energy compared to hunting at maximum intensity. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself."
