            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy while still participating in hunts. This strategy allows me to avoid competition with other wolves who may be hunting at maximum intensity, thus increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the number of sheep increasing and the wolf population remaining stable, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can catch enough food without exhausting myself or risking confrontation with other wolves. A theta of 0.40 allows me to be more strategic in my hunting while still being effective.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means hunting might become more competitive. By increasing my intensity slightly from 0.40 to 0.50, I can improve my chances of securing food while still conserving energy, as the overall wolf population remains stable.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, which means there is enough food available. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.40, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively if needed. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and ensure my survival without competing too aggressively with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased slightly, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival, especially with the current stable wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, which means I can afford to hunt with moderate intensity. This allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased slightly, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and reduce competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because with the current number of sheep and wolves, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective. The sheep population is relatively high, so I can afford to hunt less aggressively and still have a chance to catch prey without overexerting myself. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a sustainable hunt without overexerting myself. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, ensuring my survival in the long run.",
