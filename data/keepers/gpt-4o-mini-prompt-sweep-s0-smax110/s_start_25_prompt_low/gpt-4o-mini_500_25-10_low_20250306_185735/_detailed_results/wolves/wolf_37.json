            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, and the number of wolves is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still contributing to the hunt when necessary. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and hunting at a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success. This strategy helps ensure my survival by avoiding overexertion and potential injury, especially since the other wolves are also competing for the same resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and I want to increase my chances of a successful hunt without overexerting myself. By raising my intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the current situation while still conserving energy for future hunts, especially since the number of wolves remains unchanged.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and with 21 wolves competing for food, a moderate increase in hunting intensity will help me secure enough resources without overexerting myself. This balance allows for sustainability and increases my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population decreasing, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means hunting is becoming more competitive. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can improve my chances of catching enough food while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.5, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
