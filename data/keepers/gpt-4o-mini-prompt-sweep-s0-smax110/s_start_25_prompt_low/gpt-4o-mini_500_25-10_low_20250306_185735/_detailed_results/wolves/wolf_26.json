By increasing my intensity slightly from my previous theta, I can take advantage of the current sheep numbers without overexerting myself, especially since other wolves are also competing for the same resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means hunting intensity should be adjusted to ensure sustainability. By increasing my intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the current situation without overexploiting the sheep, ensuring my survival while also considering the overall balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt. This balanced approach allows me to adapt to the current situation and increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, which means food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of securing food while still conserving energy.
