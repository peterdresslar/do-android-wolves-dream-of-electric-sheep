To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves to allow the sheep to recover and prevent overhunting. This gradual adjustment will help maintain balance in the ecosystem.",

However, with the wolf population at 69, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure our long-term survival. A moderate increase to 0.35 allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition among wolves, which will help maintain balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the wolf population is relatively high. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain the balance while allowing for some recovery of the sheep population. This adjustment is gradual, ensuring we do not deplete the sheep too quickly and can adapt to future changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.10, which is only 25.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for more hunting to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious to avoid overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.33, which is only 20.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing our own wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.98, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a significant competition for resources among wolves. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while still enabling the wolf pack to sustain itself. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
