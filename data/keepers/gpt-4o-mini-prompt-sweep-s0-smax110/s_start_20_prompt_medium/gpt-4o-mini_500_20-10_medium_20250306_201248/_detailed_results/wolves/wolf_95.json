            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 116\n- Sheep population: 13.36\n- Wolf population: 47.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.400\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.28 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 12.1% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. A lower theta allows for more competition among wolves, which can help reduce our numbers slightly and give the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity slightly to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. This moderate approach will help prevent over-depletion of the sheep and promote sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating a need for a slight increase in hunting intensity to ensure the wolf population can thrive. However, I must be cautious and avoid drastic changes, as the wolf population is still relatively low. A moderate increase allows for sustainable coexistence while still addressing the needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while ensuring that we do not deplete their numbers too quickly. This adjustment supports our wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 82.7% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a sustainable coexistence as the wolf population is also growing.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, but the wolf population is slightly higher than optimal. A moderate decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while also preventing overcompetition among wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery. A gradual increase is essential to avoid depleting the sheep population too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.89, which is only 32.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.40 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population and maintaining a balance with the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.69, which is only 25.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.57, which is only 19.6% of its maximum capacity. While I want to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I need to be cautious about overhunting. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still providing enough sustenance for the wolves. This moderate approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.71, which is only 16.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while we need to be cautious about overhunting, we can afford to increase our hunting intensity slightly to ensure our survival and reproduction. A theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still enabling some hunting to support our pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.27, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, a slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted to take advantage of the current sheep availability. However, I must be cautious and avoid overhunting, as the wolf population is already significant at 53.00. This moderate adjustment allows for a sustainable balance while keeping an eye on both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.36, which is only 12.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This gradual adjustment will help ensure the long-term survival of both species."
