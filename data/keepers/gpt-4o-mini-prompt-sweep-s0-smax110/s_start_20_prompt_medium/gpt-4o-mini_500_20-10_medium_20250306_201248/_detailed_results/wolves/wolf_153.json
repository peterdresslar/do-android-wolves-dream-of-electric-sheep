            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. A gradual adjustment will help maintain balance without causing drastic changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. With a high sheep-to-wolf ratio, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover and ensures that our wolf population can thrive in the long term without risking a crash in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in sheep numbers, jeopardizing the long-term survival of both species. Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover while also managing competition with other wolves. This balanced approach supports long-term sustainability for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover while keeping competition among wolves in check, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that a slight increase in hunting intensity is appropriate to maintain balance. However, I must be cautious and avoid overhunting, as the wolf population is relatively stable. A moderate increase allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling the wolf population to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still healthy and close to its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 40, it's important to maintain a balance to avoid over-depleting the sheep. A gradual increase to 0.45 allows for sustainable hunting while keeping an eye on both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 84.2% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance of the ecosystem. This moderate adjustment helps ensure that both sheep and wolves can thrive without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover if needed. A gradual increase is prudent to avoid over-depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 57.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population being equal to the sheep population, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both populations can thrive. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow for a balance that supports long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 45.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 68, which is relatively high, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 34.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.55, it is important to maintain a balanced approach to ensure the long-term survival of both populations. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 29.68, which is only 27.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the long-term health of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.42, which is only 21.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.450 to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, focusing on sustainable coexistence while still considering the need for wolf population health.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.91, which is only 17.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover while also considering the growing wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 reflects a balanced strategy, allowing for some hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of both populations."
