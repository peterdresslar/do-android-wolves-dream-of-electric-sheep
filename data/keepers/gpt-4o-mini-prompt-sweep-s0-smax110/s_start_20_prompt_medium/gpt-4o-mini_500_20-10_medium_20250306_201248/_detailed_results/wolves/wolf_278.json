            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 325\n- Sheep population: 20.55\n- Wolf population: 62.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.350\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.33 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 18.7% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to prevent depletion. A balanced approach allows for sustainable coexistence, ensuring both wolf and sheep populations can thrive in the long term. This adjustment reflects the need to adapt to the current high sheep population while also considering the growth of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. With a high sheep-to-wolf ratio and a growing wolf population, focusing on competition among wolves will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to depletion of their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at its maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover and ensures the long-term survival of both species. It also helps to stabilize the wolf population as we adapt to the current conditions.",

Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover and ensures the long-term survival of both species. Additionally, with the wolf population at 11, it",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and my previous theta was already low. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I will maintain a focus on competition with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover. This gradual adjustment will help prevent overhunting and promote a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be cautiously increased to prevent over-depletion. However, given the current wolf population and the need to avoid sudden changes, a slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that supports both wolf reproduction and sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",

Maintaining a lower theta allows for a focus on competition with other wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderate to allow for recovery while still considering the growth of the wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",

This adjustment allows for sustainable coexistence while also supporting the wolf population",

This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between the wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term survival for both.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 88.1% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a sustainable coexistence as I monitor both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 84.56, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction. However, I must remain cautious and avoid overhunting, as the wolf population is also significant at 54.00. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance while considering the trends in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but still below maximum capacity. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still supporting the wolf population. This balance will help prevent over-depletion of the sheep and ensure long-term survival for both species.",

A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain balance without risking a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.9% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a potential for overhunting if I increase my hunting intensity too much. By adopting a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.55, which is only 18.7% of its maximum capacity. While I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting."
