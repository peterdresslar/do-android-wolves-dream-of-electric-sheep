            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 86.52, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. However, I must be cautious not to overhunt, as the wolf population is also significant at 53.00. This theta reflects a balance that supports reproduction while ensuring the sheep population can sustain itself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 71.57, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. However, I must remain cautious as the wolf population is also significant at 61.00. A theta of 0.75 strikes a balance between ensuring the wolves can reproduce and preventing overhunting of the sheep, which could lead to future scarcity.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still promoting sustainability. This adjustment reflects the need to balance our hunting efforts with the growing wolf population, ensuring we do not deplete the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is crucial to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly, and this theta reflects a balanced approach to coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 33.32, which is only 30.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is room for some hunting, we should not overexert ourselves to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, ensuring our wolf population remains healthy while also considering the long-term sustainability of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.06, which is only 23.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure on the sheep, promoting their recovery, while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our own population health.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.97, which is only 19.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support our reproduction without risking a severe depletion of the sheep. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.63, which is only 16.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is an opportunity to hunt, it is crucial to avoid overexploitation. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and adapting to the current state of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.36, which is only 14.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I need to maintain some hunting to support wolf reproduction, I should be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach that encourages sheep recovery while still supporting the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.71, which is only 12.5% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.56, which is only 11.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is potential for recovery in the sheep population. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity to 0.40, I can take advantage of this opportunity while still allowing for sustainable coexistence. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance and avoids depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.82, which is only 10.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 to 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for wolf survival while ensuring the sheep population can stabilize and grow.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.30, which is only 10.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for gradual hunting without risking the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.99, which is only 10.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.85, which is only 9.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and gradually increase. This approach aligns with the wisdom of ensuring long-term survival and avoiding sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.01, which is only 10.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is an opportunity to increase hunting slightly to help sustain wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A small increase from 0.30 to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, avoiding overexploitation of the sheep."
