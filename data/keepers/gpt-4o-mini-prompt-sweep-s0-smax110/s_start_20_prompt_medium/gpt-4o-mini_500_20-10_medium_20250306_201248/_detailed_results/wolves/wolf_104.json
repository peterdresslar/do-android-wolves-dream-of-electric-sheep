            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 105\n- Sheep population: 108.42\n- Wolf population: 34.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.232\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 3.19 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 98.6% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must do so gradually to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A small increase allows for a sustainable balance while keeping an eye on both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and I want to ensure a sustainable balance. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can help maintain the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover from previous pressures. This moderate approach aligns with the need for gradual adjustments in response to the current ecosystem state.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction without risking the sheep population too much, as they are still below maximum capacity.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the wolf population is slightly high. A moderate decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still ensuring that the wolf population remains healthy. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 43.3% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help sustain both the wolf and sheep populations while responding to the current dynamics.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and while I want to ensure the survival of my pack, I also need to allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance and prevent over-depletion of the sheep, which is crucial for long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.69, which is only 25.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.57, which is only 19.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for the sheep to recover. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to stabilize while still ensuring that the wolf population remains healthy. This moderate approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.71, which is only 16.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta will help balance our needs without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.27, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.36, which is only 12.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable, and while I need to ensure my own survival and that of my pack, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.19, which is only 11.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.23, which is only 10.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.4 to 0.35, I can maintain a focus on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring the sustainability of both populations."
