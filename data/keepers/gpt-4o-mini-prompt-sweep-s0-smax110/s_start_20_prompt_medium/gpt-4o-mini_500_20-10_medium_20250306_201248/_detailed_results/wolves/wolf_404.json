However, with a wolf population of 69, we need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to prevent a crash in the sheep population. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while also focusing on competition among wolves, ensuring both populations can stabilize and thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still ensuring that the sheep population can recover and thrive. A moderate increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, considering both the current sheep population and the need to avoid overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.22, which is only 24.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting without risking a significant depletion of the sheep. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still being mindful of the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.27, which is only 19.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I can increase hunting intensity, I should do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight decrease in theta allows for a balanced approach, enabling the sheep to recover while still permitting some hunting to sustain the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.58, which is only 16.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own wolf population. A slight increase in theta from 0.400 to 0.350 allows for some hunting without depleting the sheep further, promoting a more sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.23, which is only 13.8% of its maximum capacity.
