            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 119\n- Sheep population: 10.78\n- Wolf population: 33.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.350\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.33 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 9.8% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently healthy at 91, which allows for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This value balances the need to sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep do not deplete too quickly. It reflects a cautious approach to hunting, promoting coexistence while still allowing for some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will support wolf reproduction while still maintaining a sustainable balance with the sheep population. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid over-depletion of sheep and ensure long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover and thrive. A gradual approach is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 43.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.89, which is only 32.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is some room for hunting, I need to be cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.40 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population and maintaining a balance with the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.69, which is only 25.2% of its maximum capacity. While I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A slight increase to 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, promoting sustainable coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.57, which is only 19.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a more balanced approach, focusing on sustainable coexistence while still considering the needs of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.71, which is only 16.1% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. This approach will help balance the ecosystem and prevent a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.27, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach to hunting while still being cautious about depleting the sheep further. This adjustment supports sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.36, which is only 12.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is a need for hunting to support wolf reproduction, we must be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A moderate approach allows for some hunting while still enabling the sheep population to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.19, which is only 11.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep population too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.23, which is only 10.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to stabilize while still competing with other wolves. This moderate approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.78, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting. This will help balance the populations and prevent a crash."
