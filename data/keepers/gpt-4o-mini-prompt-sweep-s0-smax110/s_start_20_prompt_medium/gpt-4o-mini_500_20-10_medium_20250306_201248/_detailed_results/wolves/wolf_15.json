            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 94.8% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover if needed. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that we should be cautious with our hunting to prevent depleting their numbers too quickly. A moderate approach allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves. This adjustment reflects the need to balance our immediate hunting needs with the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. A lower theta will help balance the competition among wolves while ensuring that the sheep population has a chance to stabilize, promoting long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover and prevent overexploitation. This lower theta will help maintain a balance while avoiding sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution in hunting to prevent depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term balance of both populations. This approach supports sustainable coexistence as I monitor the trends in both sheep and wolf numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a healthy balance in the ecosystem. This gradual approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and while I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover.

To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance while still allowing for some hunting to support the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover and maintain a sustainable balance. With the wolf population also present, focusing on competition among wolves will help stabilize our numbers while ensuring the sheep do not deplete further.",

This adjustment allows for sustainable coexistence while also considering the current wolf population.",

However, with the wolf population at 69, which is relatively high, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting.

This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing sheep to recover. A gradual increase aligns with the wisdom of adapting to changing conditions.",

However, with the wolf population at 67, it is wise to focus on competition among wolves to prevent overhunting and allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 supports a balanced approach, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.33, which is only 20.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover.
