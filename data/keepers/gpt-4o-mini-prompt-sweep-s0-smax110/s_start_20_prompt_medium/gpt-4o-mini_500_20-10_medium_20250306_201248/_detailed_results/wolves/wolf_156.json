            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution in hunting to prevent depleting their numbers. A lower theta allows for competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition with other wolves. A lower theta will help maintain a balance and prevent over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that a slight increase in hunting intensity is appropriate to ensure wolf reproduction while still allowing for some recovery of the sheep population. This moderate adjustment helps maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep, promoting sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while maintaining a balance that prevents overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 84.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.93, it is essential to maintain a balance to avoid over-depleting the sheep. A moderate increase in theta to 0.55 allows for sustainable hunting while still considering the growth of the wolf population and the need for coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicating a healthy number of sheep per wolf, I can maintain my hunting intensity without risking depletion of the sheep population. This moderate theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both species while allowing for gradual adjustments as conditions change.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the balance between wolves and sheep. This moderate approach will help maintain our population without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 45.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.73, it is crucial to maintain a balanced approach to ensure the long-term survival of both species. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while still providing enough sustenance for the wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 29.68, which is only 27.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is some room for hunting, I need to be cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach, promoting sustainable coexistence while still enabling some hunting to support the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.42, which is only 21.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach, promoting sustainability while still being mindful of the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.91, which is only 17.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for the sheep to recover. By adopting a lower theta, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This approach aligns with my objective of ensuring long-term survival for both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.44, which is only 14.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for wolves to thrive."
