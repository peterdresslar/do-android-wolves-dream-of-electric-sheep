            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to rebound.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in sheep numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid depletion of their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover while ensuring that the wolf population remains stable. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover and ensures the long-term survival of both species. It also helps to stabilize the wolf population as we adapt to the current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover while also keeping the wolf population stable. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and sustainable coexistence.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep do not become over-depleted. A balanced approach is essential for long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and my previous theta of 0.55 was slightly higher than necessary given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio. A slight reduction to 0.50 allows for continued hunting while also giving sheep a chance to recover, promoting long-term balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 48.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 69, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure sustainability. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while also considering the need for competition among wolves, promoting a balanced ecosystem.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.34, which is only 28.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to allow for recovery. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the sustainability of both populations, ensuring that we do not deplete the sheep further and can maintain a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.52, which is only 23.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room to increase hunting intensity slightly without risking the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.37, which is only 18.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is some room for hunting, I need to be cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach that supports both the wolf population and the recovery of the sheep, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.17, which is only 15.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly."
