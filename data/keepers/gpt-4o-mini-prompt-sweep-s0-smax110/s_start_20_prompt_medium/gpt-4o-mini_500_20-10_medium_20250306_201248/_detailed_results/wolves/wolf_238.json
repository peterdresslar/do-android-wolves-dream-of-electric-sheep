            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 258\n- Sheep population: 12.56\n- Wolf population: 40.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.350\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.31 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 11.4% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 106.20, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This value supports sustainable coexistence while also considering the gradual growth of the wolf population. It strikes a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population remains healthy.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 98.01, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This balance helps maintain sustainable coexistence as we adapt to the current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This approach maintains a balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep, promoting long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for moderate hunting without depleting their numbers. This approach balances my need for hunting with the necessity of maintaining a healthy ecosystem, while also considering the growing wolf population. A slight decrease from my previous theta will help ensure that both populations can thrive together.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 50.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.83, a moderate approach allows for a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population also being relatively high, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 30.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. While my previous theta was 0.450, I want to slightly reduce my hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover and increase their numbers, which will benefit the wolf population in the long run. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.06, which is only 23.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own wolf population, which is relatively high. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and promote sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.97, which is only 19.1% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, a slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted to take advantage of the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.63, which is only 16.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.36, which is only 14.0% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting to support wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.71, which is only 12.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for sustenance with the goal of long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.56, which is only 11.4% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting."
