            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, but I need to be cautious as the wolf population is also significant. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain our numbers without depleting the sheep too quickly, allowing for a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term health of both sheep and wolves. This moderate adjustment will help maintain balance as the sheep population recovers, while also considering the growing wolf numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 51.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 66, it's important to avoid overhunting to maintain our numbers. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can continue to recover. A gradual increase is necessary to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 30.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. This moderate approach aligns with my goal of ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with a wolf population of 67, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both species can thrive. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on the long-term balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.55, which is only 18.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.20, which is only 15.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.73, which is only 13.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.4 to 0.35, I can still maintain some hunting activity while prioritizing the long-term balance and survival of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.20, which is only 12.0% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking the depletion of the sheep population. A gradual increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for some hunting while still considering the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.89, which is only 10.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population. This gradual adjustment will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.29, which is only 10.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.66, which is only 9.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are struggling, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to recover. Additionally, with a wolf population of 31, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.42, which is only 9.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to increase, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.32, which is only 9.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is a need for a cautious approach to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting to support the wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach that promotes coexistence without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is quite low at 9.4% of maximum capacity, indicating that they need time to recover. While my previous theta of 0.35 was focused on competition with other wolves, a slight increase to 0.40 allows for a modest increase in hunting intensity without overwhelming the sheep population. This approach helps maintain a balance between ensuring the survival of both species while allowing for gradual adaptation to the current conditions."
