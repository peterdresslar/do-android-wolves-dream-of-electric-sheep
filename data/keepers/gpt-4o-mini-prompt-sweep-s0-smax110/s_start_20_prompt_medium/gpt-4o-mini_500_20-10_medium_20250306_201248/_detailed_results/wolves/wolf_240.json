            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 259\n- Sheep population: 11.82\n- Wolf population: 35.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.350\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.34 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 10.7% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. A lower theta allows for competition among wolves, which can help balance our numbers while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A moderate increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, considering the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need for gradual adjustments.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a sustainable balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly, as the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a manageable number of prey.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain the balance between wolf and sheep populations while ensuring that both can thrive. By gradually increasing theta, I can respond to the current sheep population without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 50.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, enabling us to hunt enough to support our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover and thrive. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level relative to the maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling us to compete with other wolves. This approach supports long-term sustainability and avoids depleting the sheep population too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 30.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a wolf population of 70, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is low, suggesting that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our own population. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help balance the ecosystem without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.06, which is only 23.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without risking a rapid depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.97, which is only 19.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining some hunting to support the wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 reflects a balanced strategy that prioritizes sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.63, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a need for caution in hunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a bit more hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being mindful of the sheep population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.36, which is only 14.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to allow for recovery. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both sheep and wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.71, which is only 12.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is an opportunity to increase hunting intensity slightly to ensure the wolf population remains healthy. However, I must be cautious and avoid drastic changes, so a small increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach while still considering the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.56, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low at 0.31. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep population to recover while still ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting but prioritizes sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.82, which is only 10.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of the wolf population."
