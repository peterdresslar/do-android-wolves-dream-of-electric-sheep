            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 93.3% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both populations. This moderate adjustment helps to ensure that the wolf population remains healthy without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term survival of both species. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance as the wolf population grows, ensuring we do not deplete the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help sustain our wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual increase is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly, maintaining a balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 55.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population slightly exceeding the sheep population, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 43.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and while it is important to maintain a healthy wolf population, I need to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate hunting intensity will help balance the needs of both species without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.69, which is only 25.2% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A moderate adjustment helps maintain balance and allows for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.57, which is only 19.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is potential for recovery if we reduce our hunting intensity. By adopting a lower theta, I can focus more on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.71, which is only 16.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased slightly to support wolf reproduction, it is crucial to avoid overhunting to allow the sheep to recover. A small increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.27, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain its health. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the long-term balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.36, which is only 12.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is an opportunity to increase hunting intensity slightly to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A gradual increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of the wolf pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.19, which is only 11.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a presence in hunting. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support our wolf population without depleting the sheep further. It reflects a cautious approach to ensure long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.23, which is only 10.2% of its maximum capacity. With the sheep-to-wolf ratio at 0.30, it is crucial to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while maintaining a sustainable wolf population. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure and promote balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.78, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.300 allows for a more balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still enabling some hunting to support reproduction. This gradual adjustment helps ensure the long-term survival of both species."
