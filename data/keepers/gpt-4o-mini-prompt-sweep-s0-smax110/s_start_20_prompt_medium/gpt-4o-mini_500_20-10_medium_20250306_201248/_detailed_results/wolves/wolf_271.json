            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 38.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 70, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both populations can thrive. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, promoting a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 33.32, which is 30.3% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.35 helps maintain balance without risking a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.06, which is only 23.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, promoting a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.97, which is only 19.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach to hunting without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.63, which is only 16.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, reducing pressure on the sheep while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.36, which is only 14.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while we need to ensure our hunting does not deplete the sheep further, a slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted to support our wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.71, which is only 12.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack without depleting the sheep further, promoting a healthier ecosystem in the long run.",
