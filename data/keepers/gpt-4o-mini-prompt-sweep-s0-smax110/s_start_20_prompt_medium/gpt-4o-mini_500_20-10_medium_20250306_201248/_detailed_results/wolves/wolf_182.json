            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 84.2% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while ensuring that we do not over-deplete their numbers. This adjustment will help sustain our wolf population without risking a crash in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 79.15, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help sustain wolf reproduction while ensuring that the sheep population does not decline too rapidly. A gradual approach is essential to maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep do not become too depleted. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid sudden crashes in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports both wolf reproduction and sheep recovery. This approach balances the need to maintain our wolf population while ensuring the sheep do not become too depleted, fostering a healthy ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and while it is important to maintain a healthy wolf population, I need to ensure that the sheep can recover. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while also giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 29.68, which is only 27.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting a lower theta, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This approach aligns with my goal of ensuring the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.42, which is only 21.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.91, which is only 17.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is a need for a cautious approach to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from the previous theta of 0.40 to 0.35, I can still maintain a focus on competition with other wolves while allowing for some hunting. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.44, which is only 14.9% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I also want to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support reproduction while still being cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.31, which is only 13.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack without depleting the sheep further, ensuring a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.06, which is only 11.9% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the survival of my pack, I must also allow the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between hunting and allowing the sheep to thrive, while still being cautious not to over-deplete their numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.93, which is only 10.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.34, which is only 10.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted to help sustain our wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover. However, I must be cautious and avoid drastic changes, so a moderate increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.02, which is only 10.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover rather than intensifying hunting. A moderate approach will help maintain a balance between our population and the sheep, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.89, which is only 9.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while allowing the sheep population to stabilize."
