            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 400\n- Sheep population: 12.21\n- Wolf population: 41.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.350\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.30 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 11.1% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that we should maintain a balanced approach to hunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while avoiding over-depletion of the sheep population. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of gradual changes and helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 91.1% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help sustain both populations without risking a crash, as the wolf population is also growing. A moderate approach will allow for gradual adaptation to the changing conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 88.48, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction without overly depleting the sheep, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance of the ecosystem. This adjustment will help maintain a sustainable cycle without risking a rapid depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a sustainable balance. This adjustment reflects the need to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly, considering the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the overall health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 41.5% of its maximum capacity, which indicates that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, it is wise to maintain a cautious approach to avoid over-depleting the sheep. A slight decrease in hunting intensity allows for a balance that supports both populations while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 31.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with a wolf population of 70, which is relatively high, I need to be cautious about overhunting. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining enough food for the wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.22, which is only 24.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.27, which is only 19.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for increased hunting intensity without risking immediate depletion. However, with the wolf population at 63.00, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight increase to 0.45 allows for a balanced approach that supports both sheep recovery and wolf population sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.58, which is only 16.0% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a focus on competition with other wolves, a moderate theta value of 0.35 will help ensure a sustainable balance without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.23, which is only 13.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for gradual hunting without risking the sheep population too much. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still being mindful of the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.38, which is only 12.2% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must prioritize the recovery of the sheep. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.21, which is only 11.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is potential for recovery if we allow the sheep to increase. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity to 0.40, I can still support the wolf population"
