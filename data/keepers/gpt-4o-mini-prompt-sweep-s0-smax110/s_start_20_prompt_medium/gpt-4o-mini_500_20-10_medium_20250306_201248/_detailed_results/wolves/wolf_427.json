            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A value of 0.45 strikes a balance between competing with other wolves and maintaining a sustainable sheep population, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover and prevent overexploitation. This lower theta value will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem while also considering the potential for future wolf population growth.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery. Maintaining a lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, while also preventing overhunting and potential crashes in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and while I want to increase hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that supports both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is close to its maximum capacity, indicating a need for cautious hunting to prevent depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the sustainability of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 97.70, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment reflects a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. It also considers the current wolf population, which is stable but should not be overexploited.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that can support wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This balance helps maintain both populations sustainably without risking depletion or overcompetition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports both wolf reproduction and sheep recovery. This value reflects a cautious approach, ensuring that we do not over-deplete the sheep while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 48.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 69, which is relatively high, I need to be cautious about overhunting. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still supporting the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level relative to the maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are not enough sheep to sustain aggressive hunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. This approach aligns with maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 28.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for recovery. With a wolf population of 70, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is low, suggesting that we should focus on allowing the sheep to replenish while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our own population. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach that balances competition with sustainable hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.52, which is only 23.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.37, which is only 18.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, a more moderate approach is prudent to allow the sheep to recover. Additionally, with a wolf population of 61, it's important to avoid overhunting to ensure our long-term survival. A gradual adjustment towards a slightly higher theta will help maintain balance without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.17, which is only 15.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.75, which is only 13.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack without depleting the sheep further, promoting a balanced ecosystem."
