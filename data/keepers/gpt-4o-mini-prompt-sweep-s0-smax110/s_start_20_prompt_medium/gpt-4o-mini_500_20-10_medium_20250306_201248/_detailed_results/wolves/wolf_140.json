            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still ensuring that the sheep population can recover and thrive. By maintaining a balance, I can avoid depleting the sheep too quickly and ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.69, which is only 25.2% of its maximum capacity. While my previous theta of 0.750 was effective for hunting, it is important to gradually reduce hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. A theta of 0.65 strikes a balance between maintaining my hunting needs and ensuring the sheep can thrive, promoting long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I need to maintain a healthy wolf population, I also want to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate hunting intensity will help sustain both populations without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.71, which is only 16.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.27, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting sheep. A lower theta allows the sheep population to recover while still maintaining a sustainable wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.36, which is only 12.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is an opportunity to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A gradual increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, considering both the need for wolves to thrive and the importance of maintaining a sustainable sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.19, which is only 11.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for sustenance with the long-term health of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.23, which is only 10.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further.
