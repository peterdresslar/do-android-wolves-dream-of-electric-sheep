            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and a slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of gradual changes and ensures long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover and thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level relative to its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both sheep and wolves while maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 29.68, which is only 27.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some reproduction among wolves while still giving sheep a chance to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 reflects a balanced approach, promoting sustainability without risking a rapid decline in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.42, which is only 21.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting without risking depletion. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still enabling some hunting to support our population growth.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.91, which is only 17.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to be cautious with our hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of both populations. It also reflects the need to reduce hunting intensity slightly due to the growing wolf population of 59, ensuring we maintain a balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.44, which is only 14.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased slightly to support wolf reproduction, it is crucial to avoid overhunting to allow the sheep population to recover. A small increase to 0.40 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for wolf survival with the sustainability of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.31, which is only 13.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support our wolf population without over-depleting the sheep, promoting a sustainable balance.",

This indicates that there is potential for recovery if I reduce hunting intensity slightly. By increasing theta only moderately to 0.40, I can still maintain some hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing sheep numbers to stabilize and grow, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.93, which is only 10.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack without depleting the sheep further, promoting a more balanced ecosystem.",

While I need to maintain a focus on hunting to support the wolf population, I must also be cautious not to deplete the sheep further.
