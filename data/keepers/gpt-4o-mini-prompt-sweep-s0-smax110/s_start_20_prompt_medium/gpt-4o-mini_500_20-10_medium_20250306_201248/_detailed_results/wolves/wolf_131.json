            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 109\n- Sheep population: 61.51\n- Wolf population: 65.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.936\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.95 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 55.9% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

Given that the sheep population is at 55.9% of its maximum capacity, I can afford to maintain a higher hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious about the overall balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 43.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for increased hunting without risking immediate depletion. However, with the wolf population at 69, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure our long-term survival. A slight increase to 0.70 allows for sustainable hunting while still considering the balance needed for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and while I need to maintain a healthy wolf population, I also want to ensure that the sheep can recover. A moderate hunting intensity allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves. This adjustment reflects the need to balance immediate hunting with the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I need to maintain some hunting to support the wolf population, I must also be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A moderate approach allows for sustainable coexistence while still addressing the needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.57, which is only 19.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By adopting a lower theta, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This gradual adjustment helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.71, which is only 16.1% of its maximum capacity. While I need to increase my hunting intensity to ensure the wolf population can thrive, I must do so gradually to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach that supports both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.27, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need to compete with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to support our population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.36, which is only 12.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting sustainability while still considering the need to adapt to the current conditions.",

This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from the previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35, I can still maintain some hunting activity while prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both populations. This moderate adjustment helps avoid over-depletion of the sheep and supports a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be increased slightly to ensure our survival without depleting the sheep too quickly.
