            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves, ensuring long-term sustainability for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that further intense hunting could lead to depletion and threaten long-term sustainability. Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring a balanced ecosystem.",

Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep too quickly. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is close to its maximum capacity, indicating that they can sustain some hunting pressure without significant depletion. However, the wolf population is relatively low, so I need to ensure that we maintain our numbers while allowing the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that supports both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 97.70, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a sustainable balance. This adjustment will help support the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly, aligning with the wisdom of gradual changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 76.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.54, it is wise to maintain a moderate hunting intensity to ensure the wolf population remains stable while allowing the sheep to recover. This slight decrease from my previous theta reflects a cautious approach to avoid over-depleting the sheep while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still considering the need for balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, and while it is beneficial to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must also consider the growing wolf population. A theta of 0.40 allows for a balanced approach that supports both species without risking a rapid depletion of sheep.",

This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery. A gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and my previous theta of 0.450 was slightly aggressive given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.40, I can allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a focus on competition with other wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.52, which is only 23.2% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I also want to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 will help me maintain a balance between hunting and allowing the sheep to rebound, ensuring long-term sustainability."
