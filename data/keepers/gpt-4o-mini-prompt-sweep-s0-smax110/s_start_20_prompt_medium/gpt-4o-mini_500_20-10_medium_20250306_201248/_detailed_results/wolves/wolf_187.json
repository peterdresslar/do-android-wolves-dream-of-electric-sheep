            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 57.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population being equal to the sheep population, I need to be cautious not to overhunt. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance while allowing both populations to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the sheep population at 45.2% of maximum capacity, a slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep to recover. This adjustment maintains a sustainable coexistence between wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 34.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 69, it is wise to avoid overhunting to prevent a crash in the sheep population. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the balance needed for long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 29.68, which is only 27.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is some opportunity for hunting, it is crucial to avoid overexploitation to allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term survival for both.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.42, which is only 21.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for more hunting to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious to avoid overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.91, which is only 17.2% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population, a lower theta value of 0.35 will help balance competition among wolves and prevent overhunting. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.44, which is only 14.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I need to maintain a focus on hunting to support my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.31, which is only 13.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition among wolves, ensuring a balance that can support both populations in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be increased slightly to support wolf reproduction while still allowing for some recovery of the sheep population. This moderate increase aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a balance and responding to the current conditions without making drastic changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.93, which is only 10.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.34, which is only 10.3% of its maximum capacity. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.34, it is crucial to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both sheep and wolves, while also preventing overexploitation of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.02, which is only 10% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should be cautious with our hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach that acknowledges the need for some hunting while still prioritizing the sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.89, which is only 9.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help ensure the sheep population stabilizes while also allowing the wolf population to adjust. A lower theta will promote a healthier ecosystem balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.99, which is only 10.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is potential for recovery in the sheep population if I reduce my hunting intensity slightly. By increasing theta from 0.30 to 0.35, I can still maintain some hunting to support the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover, thus promoting a more sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.09, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. A moderate increase to 0.40 reflects a cautious approach to balance hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring the sustainability of both populations."
