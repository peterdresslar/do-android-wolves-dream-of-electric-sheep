            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep do not become overly depleted. A gradual adjustment is necessary to maintain balance and avoid sudden population crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 72.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.41, it is important to maintain a balanced approach to ensure the long-term survival of both species. A moderate theta of 0.55 allows for sustainable hunting while also considering the growth of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 57.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population being equal to the sheep population, a moderate approach is necessary to avoid over-depletion of sheep while still allowing for some hunting to support wolf reproduction. This balance will help maintain both populations in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 45.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.73, it is essential to maintain a balance that allows both populations to thrive. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will help the sheep recover while still allowing for some hunting to support the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual increase is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 29.68, which is only 27.0% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still competing with other wolves. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting without depleting the sheep population further, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.42, which is only 21.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.91, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance while still considering the need for wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.44, which is only 14.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach to hunting while still considering the need for wolf population stability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.31, which is only 13.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to stabilize while still competing with other wolves. This moderate approach helps maintain a balance between the two populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.06, which is only 11.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By increasing my theta slightly from 0.35 to 0.40, I can maintain a balance between hunting and allowing the sheep population to stabilize, while also considering the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.93, which is only 10.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing more on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to ensure our population remains healthy. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.34, which is only 10.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some reproduction among wolves while still giving sheep a chance to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.02, which is only 10% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to rebuild their numbers. Additionally, with a wolf population of 29, focusing on competition among wolves rather than intense hunting will help maintain our numbers while ensuring the sheep can thrive in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.89, which is only 9.9% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting sheep. This will help balance the populations and avoid depleting the sheep further."
