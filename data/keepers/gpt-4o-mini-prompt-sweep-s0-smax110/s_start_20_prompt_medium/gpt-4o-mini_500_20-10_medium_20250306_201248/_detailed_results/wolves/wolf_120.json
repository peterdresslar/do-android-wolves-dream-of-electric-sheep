            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid over-depletion of the sheep and maintain balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 55.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.95, it is crucial to maintain a balance that allows both populations to thrive. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help the sheep recover while still allowing for some hunting to support the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.89, which is only 32.6% of its maximum capacity. While I want to ensure the survival of my pack, I also recognize the need for the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow for a more sustainable balance between our populations, ensuring that we do not deplete the sheep further while still allowing for some hunting to support our needs.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.69, which is only 25.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly, considering the current dynamics.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.57, which is only 19.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should maintain a moderate hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while still ensuring our wolf population remains healthy. A slight decrease from my previous theta of 0.45 will help balance our needs with the sustainability of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.71, which is only 16.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to allow the sheep to recover while also considering the growing wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still permitting some hunting to maintain our reproductive needs.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.27, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach to hunting while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.36, which is only 12.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a sustainable hunting strategy. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support the wolf population without depleting the sheep further, ensuring a balance that can lead to long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.19, which is only 11.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting without risking the depletion of the sheep. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach to hunting while still considering the need for sustainable coexistence. It reflects a gradual adjustment in response to the current state of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.23, which is only 10.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while being mindful of the current low sheep numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain balance and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.63, which is only 9.7% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a slight hunting intensity. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.30 to 0.35 reflects a balanced approach that considers the current low sheep population while also being mindful of the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.51, which is only 9.6% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting sheep. This will help maintain the balance and prevent a crash in the sheep population, while also allowing for gradual adjustments in the future as conditions change.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.58, which is only 9.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderate to allow for recovery while still enabling some hunting to support the wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta will help balance the needs of both species."
