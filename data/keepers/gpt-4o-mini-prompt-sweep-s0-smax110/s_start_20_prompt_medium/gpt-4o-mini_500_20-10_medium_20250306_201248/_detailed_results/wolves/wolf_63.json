However, my previous theta was very low, and the wolf population is also significant. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, enabling some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover and maintain sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep. This adjustment reflects the need to respond to the growing sheep population without overexploiting them, ensuring sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 41.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, I need to be cautious to avoid over-depleting the sheep. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that supports both sheep recovery and wolf population health.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and while I need to ensure my pack's survival through hunting, I must also be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support reproduction while still prioritizing a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 25.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for recovery. With a wolf population of 67, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is low, suggesting that we should focus on competition among wolves rather than intense hunting. A slight increase in theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.33, which is only 20.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need to adapt to the changing dynamics of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.89, which is only 17.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to allow for recovery. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the sustainability of both populations.",

This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can stabilize and grow.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.55, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking their long-term survival. This adjustment will help maintain a balance as the wolf population is relatively high, and it is essential to ensure that we do not over-deplete the sheep while still allowing for wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.15, which is only 10.1% of its maximum capacity.
