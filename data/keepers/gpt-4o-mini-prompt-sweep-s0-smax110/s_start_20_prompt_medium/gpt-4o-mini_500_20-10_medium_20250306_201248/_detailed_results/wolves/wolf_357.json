            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A lower theta will help reduce competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to stabilize, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover and prevent overexploitation. This lower theta will help maintain a balance while avoiding competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover and ensures the long-term survival of both species. It is crucial to focus on competition with other wolves at this stage to stabilize our population before considering an increase in hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and while I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help sustain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual increase is essential to maintain balance and avoid sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 91.1% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 43, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 88.48, allowing for a moderate hunting approach. This will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations while avoiding overhunting. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for more competition among wolves, which can help stabilize our numbers as we adapt to the current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for some hunting without risking depletion. Given the wolf population is slightly higher than the sheep population, a small reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and allow both populations to stabilize. This approach aligns with the wisdom of making gradual adjustments in response to current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population also being relatively high, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure long-term survival for both species. A gradual increase to 0.45 allows for a balanced approach that supports reproduction while still considering the health of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 31.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.50, it is important to maintain a balance that allows for the sheep to recover while also ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help sustain the sheep population and prevent overexploitation, allowing for a more stable ecosystem in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover and thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.27, which is only 19.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for the sheep to recover, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to increase their numbers while still ensuring that the wolf population remains stable. A gradual approach is essential to avoid depleting the sheep further and to maintain a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.58, which is only 16.0% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing competition with other wolves, which will help stabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.23, which is only 13.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased slightly to support wolf reproduction, it is crucial to avoid overhunting to allow the sheep population to recover. A gradual increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of the wolf pack."
