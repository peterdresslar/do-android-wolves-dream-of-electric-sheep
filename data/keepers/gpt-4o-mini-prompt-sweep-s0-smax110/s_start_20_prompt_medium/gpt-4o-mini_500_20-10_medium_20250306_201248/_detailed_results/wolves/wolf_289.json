By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a stable wolf population. This gradual adjustment will help ensure long-term sustainability.",

However, with the wolf population also present, I must balance hunting with competition among wolves. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for sustainable hunting while still considering the long-term health of both populations.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity slightly while allowing the sheep to recover. This moderate approach will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and while I want to increase hunting to support wolf reproduction, I must do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a more balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 88.1% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment reflects a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover and thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 84.56, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we have enough sheep to sustain our hunting without over-depleting their numbers. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a more cautious approach, ensuring that both populations can thrive while we adapt to the current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment reflects the need to balance the growing wolf population while still ensuring the sheep can recover and thrive.",

With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.49, it is essential to maintain a balance that allows both populations to thrive. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will help the sheep recover while still allowing for sustainable wolf reproduction.",

A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that supports both wolf reproduction and sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.55, which is only 18.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is some opportunity for hunting, it is crucial to avoid overexploitation to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still enabling some hunting to support our population without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.20, which is only 15.6% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A gradual increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, considering both the need for wolves to thrive and the importance of maintaining a sustainable sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.73, which is only 13.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both populations.
