This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to ensure that both populations can thrive without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting approach. This will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep. Given the current wolf population, a slight reduction in hunting intensity will also help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A theta of 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for some hunting while also considering the need to maintain a sustainable ecosystem for both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.27, which is only 19.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 reflects a balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.58, which is only 16.0% of its maximum capacity. A slight increase in hunting intensity to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, enabling us to take advantage of the sheep population while still considering the sustainability of both species. This adjustment is small enough to avoid drastic impacts on the ecosystem, promoting coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.23, which is only 13.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for moderate hunting without risking depletion. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.400 to 0.450, I can help ensure the wolf population remains healthy while still allowing the sheep to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
