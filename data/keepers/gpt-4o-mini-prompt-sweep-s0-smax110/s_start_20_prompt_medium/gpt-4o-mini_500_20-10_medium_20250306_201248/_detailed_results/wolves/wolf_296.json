            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain balance and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. A moderate hunting intensity will allow for some sheep depletion while still giving them a chance to recover. This approach balances the needs of both populations and avoids overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring sustainable coexistence while also allowing for some growth in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 96.92, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 84.56, which allows for a moderate hunting approach. This will help maintain a balance between the wolf and sheep populations while avoiding overhunting. As the sheep population is at 76.9% of its maximum capacity, a slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow for recovery and sustainability in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover gradually.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 51.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population being relatively high, a slight reduction in hunting intensity is prudent to allow for better coexistence and to prevent over-depletion of the sheep. This moderate adjustment will help maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual increase is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.49, it indicates that the wolves are slightly outnumbering the sheep. A moderate decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to thrive. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a balance and responding to the current ecosystem state.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.27, which is only 23.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased to support wolf reproduction, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for sustainable cycles.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.55, which is only 18.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 will help us focus on competition with other wolves while allowing for some hunting, ensuring we do not deplete the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.20, which is only 15.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for increased hunting without risking immediate depletion. However, the wolf population is relatively high at 57.00, so I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach that supports both sheep recovery and wolf sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.73, which is only 13.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.20, which is only 12.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some reproduction among wolves while still enabling the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without risking a significant depletion of the sheep."
