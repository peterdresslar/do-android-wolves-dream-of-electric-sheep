            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and my previous theta was very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while also considering the gradual increase in wolf competition. This small adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and my previous theta was quite low. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition with other wolves. A gradual increase from my previous theta will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution in hunting to prevent depletion. A lower theta allows for competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover and ensures a sustainable balance in the ecosystem, while also considering the current wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition with other wolves. A gradual decrease in hunting will help maintain balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 3.67, it\u2019s crucial to avoid overhunting to ensure both populations can thrive in the long term. A gradual approach will help maintain balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and a slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain the balance without depleting the sheep too quickly. This moderate adjustment allows for sustainable coexistence while also considering the current wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. A moderate increase to 0.40 will help maintain a balance between wolf reproduction and sheep recovery, ensuring long-term sustainability.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep. This moderate adjustment will help sustain both populations without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 51.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.86, it is important to maintain a balance that allows for both sheep recovery and wolf population stability. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help ensure the long-term survival of both species while avoiding over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery. A gradual increase is essential to avoid depleting the sheep population too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 30.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 69, it is essential to avoid overhunting and allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance while still allowing for some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.27, which is only 23.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I need to maintain a focus on hunting to support wolf reproduction, I should do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting intensity while still considering the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.55, which is only 18.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is an opportunity to hunt, I need to be cautious and avoid overexploitation. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while still giving the sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.20, which is only 15.6% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A gradual increase helps maintain balance and avoids sudden population crashes."
