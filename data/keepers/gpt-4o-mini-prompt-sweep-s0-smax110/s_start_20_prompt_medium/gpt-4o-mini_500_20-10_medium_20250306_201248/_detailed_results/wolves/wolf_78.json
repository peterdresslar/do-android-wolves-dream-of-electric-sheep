This gradual adjustment helps maintain a sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 43.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, I need to be cautious to avoid overhunting and ensure our long-term survival. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for more hunting while still maintaining a balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level relative to its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated. A slight decrease in hunting will allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of making gradual adjustments to ensure long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.69, which is only 25.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without over-depleting the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.57, which is only 19.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight decrease in theta allows for a balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still enabling some hunting to support our population."
