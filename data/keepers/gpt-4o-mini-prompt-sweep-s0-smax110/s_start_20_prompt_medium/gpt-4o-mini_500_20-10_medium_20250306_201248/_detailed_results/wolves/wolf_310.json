            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity while ensuring that the sheep can recover. This adjustment supports the long-term survival of both species and maintains a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 84.56, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we can afford to reduce our hunting intensity slightly. This will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling us to compete effectively with other wolves. A gradual adjustment helps maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment reflects a balance between ensuring the wolf population remains healthy while allowing the sheep to recover and thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 51.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 66.00, I need to be cautious about overhunting. A slight decrease in hunting intensity allows for a more sustainable balance, giving sheep a chance to recover while still ensuring the wolf population remains healthy.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly and to ensure long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 30.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 69, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both populations can thrive. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still providing enough resources for the wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.27, which is only 23.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for more hunting intensity while still being cautious, as the wolf population is relatively high at 67.00. This balance will help ensure both populations can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.55, which is only 18.7% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, allowing both populations to stabilize without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.20, which is only 15.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.73, which is only 13.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, promoting a healthier balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.20, which is only 12.0% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I also want to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help balance the needs of both populations without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.89, which is only 10.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.29, which is only 10.3% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I also want to allow the sheep to recover.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.66, which is only 9.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own population growth. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of both species."
