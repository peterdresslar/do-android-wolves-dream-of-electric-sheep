Maintaining a lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, as it prevents overhunting while allowing the sheep population to stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery. Maintaining a balance is crucial to ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, especially since the wolf population is already at a healthy level. A gradual approach will help avoid overexploitation of the sheep.",

Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition with other wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that they can sustain a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. A moderate increase to 0.40 allows for a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting both wolf reproduction and sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 93.9% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balanced approach. This adjustment will help support the wolf population without risking a rapid decline in the sheep numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 92.66, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are enough sheep to sustain our hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a more cautious approach, ensuring the long-term survival of both species while still allowing for some hunting.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and a slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and ensures long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 45.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 68, which is relatively high, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still promoting coexistence and preventing a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level relative to its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are not enough sheep to support a higher hunting intensity without risking depletion. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while still giving the sheep a chance to recover, which is essential for the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 29.68, which is only 27.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I can increase hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate increase to 0.45 allows for some hunting while still considering the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.42, which is only 21.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I can increase my hunting intensity slightly, I need to be cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate increase to 0.40 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population and maintaining a balance with the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.91, which is only 17.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 will help balance the need for hunting with the necessity of not depleting the sheep further."
