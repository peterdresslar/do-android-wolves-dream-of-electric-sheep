            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. A moderate theta value will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can stabilize, promoting long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that we should be cautious with our hunting to avoid depleting their numbers too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a bit more hunting to support our population while still prioritizing the sustainability of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is close to its maximum capacity, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, I want to avoid overhunting and allow for some recovery of the sheep population while still ensuring the wolves can thrive. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach to hunting and competition.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 88.1% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, the wolf population is also significant, and I want to avoid overhunting that could lead to a crash in the sheep population. A gradual increase to 0.45 allows for sustainable coexistence while still promoting wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing sustainability. This adjustment will help maintain a balance as the wolf population grows, ensuring we do not deplete the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep. This adjustment reflects the need to adapt to the current conditions without risking depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 51.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 66.00, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 30.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 69, it is wise to maintain a cautious approach to hunting to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow for a more sustainable balance while still enabling the wolf population to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.27, which is only 23.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I can increase my hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate increase to 0.45 allows for some hunting while still considering the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.55, which is only 18.7% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",

This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without risking depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for more hunting intensity while still being cautious, promoting a balance that supports both wolf reproduction and sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.73, which is only 13.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I need to maintain some hunting to support the wolf population, I should focus on a more balanced approach to allow the sheep to recover.
