            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 84.56, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain our wolf population while still ensuring that the sheep can recover. A gradual adjustment is key to maintaining balance.",

However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.17, it is important to maintain a balance to avoid over-depleting the sheep while still ensuring the wolf population can thrive. A moderate theta of 0.60 allows for sustainable hunting while keeping an eye on the trends in both populations.",

This approach helps maintain balance in the ecosystem while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 30.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. Given the current wolf population, a slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain our numbers while allowing the sheep to recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of making gradual adjustments to ensure long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.27, which is only 23.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I need to maintain some hunting to support wolf reproduction, I should also be cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",

This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to allow the sheep population to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the sustainability of both species.",
