A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow for a more sustainable balance, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of the wolf pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.69, which is only 25.2% of its maximum capacity.

A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.40 will help maintain balance and avoid sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.57, which is only 19.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.35, I can focus more on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
