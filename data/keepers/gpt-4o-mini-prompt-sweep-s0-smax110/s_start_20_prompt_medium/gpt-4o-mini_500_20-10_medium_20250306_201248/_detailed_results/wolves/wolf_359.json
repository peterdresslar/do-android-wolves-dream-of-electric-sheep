            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that they are vulnerable to overhunting. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while I focus on competing with other wolves. This gradual approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and my previous theta was quite low. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity further to allow the sheep to recover and prevent overexploitation. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be kept low to allow for recovery. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 3.79, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. A lower theta allows for a focus on competition among wolves, which can help maintain our numbers while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that we should be cautious with our hunting to avoid depleting their numbers too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a modest rise in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between our populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 91.1% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help sustain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual increase is necessary to avoid over-depletion of the sheep, ensuring long-term balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 80.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 52, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both species. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance as the wolf population grows.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual increase in theta aligns with the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the overall ecosystem dynamics.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 41.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.66, it is important to maintain a balance that allows both populations to thrive. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population also being relatively high, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.22, which is only 24.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate increase to 0.40 allows for some hunting while still considering the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.27, which is only 19.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.58, which is only 16.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.23, which is only 13.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should be cautious with our hunting to allow the sheep to recover. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.29, there is still a need for some hunting to sustain our wolf population. A slight increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing our needs."
