            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 90.8% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep do not become over-depleted. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.80 allows for a balanced approach, responding to the current conditions without risking a sudden decline in sheep numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 79.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.64, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 67.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. A moderate increase from my previous theta allows for continued reproduction among wolves while ensuring that the sheep population can recover and thrive. This balance helps avoid over-depletion of sheep and supports the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. This value helps ensure that both the sheep and wolf populations can thrive without depleting resources too quickly. It reflects a cautious increase in hunting intensity, considering the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need to maintain sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 41.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a wolf population of 69, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is low, suggesting that if I increase hunting intensity too much, it could lead to a rapid decline in sheep numbers. By adopting a moderate theta of 0.35, I can focus on competition with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population also being relatively high, I want to ensure that we do not overhunt and deplete the sheep too quickly. A gradual increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach that supports both our needs and the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.10, which is only 25.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I can increase hunting intensity, it is crucial to do so gradually to avoid depleting the sheep further. A theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population and maintaining a balance with the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.33, which is only 20.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.89, which is only 17.2% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the balance and sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.19, which is only 14.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting without risking depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach to hunting while still considering the need for sustainable coexistence. It\u2019s important to monitor the trends and adjust gradually.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.14, which is only 12.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to stabilize while still competing with other wolves. This moderate approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.92, which is only 11.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for gradual adjustments.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the wolf population is relatively high. A moderate hunting intensity will allow for some hunting while still enabling the sheep to recover. This approach helps maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.55, which is only 10.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly."
