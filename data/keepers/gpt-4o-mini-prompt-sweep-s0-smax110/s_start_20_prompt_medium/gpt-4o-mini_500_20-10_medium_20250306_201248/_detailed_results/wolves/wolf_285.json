This moderate adjustment will help maintain the wolf population without over-depleting the sheep.",

This adjustment reflects the need to support wolf reproduction without over-depleting the sheep population.",

However, the wolf population is also relatively high, so a moderate increase in hunting intensity is warranted to ensure sustainable coexistence. This adjustment allows for a gradual increase in hunting while still considering the long-term health of both populations.",
