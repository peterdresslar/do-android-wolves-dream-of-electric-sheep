            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 78, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are enough sheep to support a moderate level of hunting. This adjustment allows for continued reproduction among wolves while ensuring that the sheep population does not decline too rapidly. It strikes a balance between competing with other wolves and maintaining a sustainable prey base.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover gradually.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term survival for both. A slight reduction from my previous theta will also account for the growing wolf population, preventing overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 32.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 70, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.69, which is only 25.2% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover while still ensuring the wolf population remains stable, a lower theta value will help reduce hunting intensity and promote a sustainable balance. This approach aligns with the wisdom of making gradual adjustments in response to population trends.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.57, which is only 19.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some reproduction among wolves while still enabling the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting sustainability without risking a drastic decline in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.71, which is only 16.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support our wolf population without risking a rapid decline in the sheep population, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.27, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. While I need to focus on hunting to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A slight increase in theta allows for more hunting while still maintaining a balance that supports the recovery of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.36, which is only 12.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to allow the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still enabling some hunting to support our reproduction without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.19, which is only 11.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some reproduction among wolves while still giving sheep a chance to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.78, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while maintaining a stable wolf population. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure and promote a more sustainable ecosystem.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.51, which is only 9.6% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable balance, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensifying hunting. This lower theta will help prevent further depletion of the sheep population while still allowing for some competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.58, which is only 9.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.300 to 0.350, I can maintain a focus on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, promoting a gradual balance without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.74, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I need to be cautious about overhunting, I can afford to increase my hunting intensity slightly to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.97, which is only 10.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support our wolf population without risking a rapid decline in sheep numbers, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.29, which is only 10.3% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still being cautious. A moderate increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach that supports wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly. It also considers the current wolf population, which is relatively high, and allows for sustainable coexistence."
