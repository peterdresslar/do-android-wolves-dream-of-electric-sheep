            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 253\n- Sheep population: 26.06\n- Wolf population: 66.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.400\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.39 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 23.7% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both populations.",

A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term balance between our populations.",

By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a healthy balance in our ecosystem. This gradual approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",

Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance.",

A slight increase in hunting intensity will help sustain our numbers without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high and close to its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover if needed. A gradual increase is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 98.01, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 45.00, I must be cautious not to overhunt, as this could lead to a depletion of sheep and ultimately harm our long-term survival. A gradual increase to 0.45 allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, and while it is beneficial to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must also consider the current wolf population and avoid over-depleting the sheep. A theta of 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some growth in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population also being relatively high, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 33.32, which is only 30.3% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and allowing the sheep to increase their numbers. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.06, which is only 23.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover.
