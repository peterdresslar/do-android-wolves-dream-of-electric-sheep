However, with the wolf population at 71.00, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting, which could lead to a depletion of sheep. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover.",

By lowering my hunting intensity slightly, I can allow the sheep population to recover while still ensuring that my pack remains healthy. This moderate approach will help maintain a balance between both populations and avoid over-depletion of sheep.",
