This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level relative to its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are not enough sheep to support aggressive hunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further.
