            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that we should maintain a balanced approach to hunting. A slight reduction from my previous theta allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some hunting to support our wolf population. This adjustment helps prevent over-depletion of the sheep and keeps our pack healthy.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is close to its maximum capacity, indicating that we should maintain a balanced approach to hunting. A slight reduction from my previous theta allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some hunting to support our wolf population. This adjustment helps prevent over-depletion of the sheep and allows for gradual recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still healthy at 97.70, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are enough sheep to sustain the wolf population. However, to ensure long-term balance and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly, a slight reduction in hunting intensity is prudent. This adjustment allows for a more sustainable coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep do not become over-depleted. A theta of 0.55 strikes a balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep, promoting sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that can support both wolf reproduction and sheep recovery. This approach helps maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population does not decline too rapidly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term health of both populations. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach, as the wolf population is also significant, and we must avoid overhunting to prevent future crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring both can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we need to be cautious with our hunting intensity. A lower theta allows the sheep to recover while still enabling us to compete with other wolves. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.52, which is only 23.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the immediate needs of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.37, which is only 18.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a lower hunting intensity is necessary to allow the sheep to recover. Additionally, with a wolf population of 61.00, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.17, which is only 15.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting without risking the depletion of the sheep. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still being mindful of the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.75, which is only 13.4% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while prioritizing the balance needed for sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.37, which is only 12.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain my pack while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will enable me to adapt to the current conditions without risking a rapid depletion of the sheep.",
