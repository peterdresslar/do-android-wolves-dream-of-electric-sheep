Maintaining a focus on competition with other wolves will help stabilize our population while ensuring the sheep can bounce back in the future.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that we should be cautious with our hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term balance of the ecosystem.",

This adjustment is small and aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence, considering both the current sheep population and the growth of the wolf pack.",

However, I want to maintain a balanced approach to ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, so a moderate increase is appropriate.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 33.32, which is only 30.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need to adapt to the current dynamics of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.06, which is only 23.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it is essential to focus on allowing the sheep to recover.
