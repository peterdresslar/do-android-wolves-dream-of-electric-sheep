            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 79% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate hunting approach. This will help sustain both the wolf and sheep populations while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a cautious response to the growing wolf population, ensuring we maintain balance without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 67.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 60, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure our long-term survival. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery. A gradual increase aligns with the current trends and maintains balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term health of both populations. This moderate adjustment helps maintain balance as the wolf population is relatively high, and it allows for gradual adaptation to changing conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. It",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.10, which is only 25.5% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, it's important to allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, allowing both populations to stabilize without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.33, which is only 20.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our population without depleting the sheep further, promoting a more balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.89, which is only 17.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for sustainable cycles.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.19, which is only 14.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for increased hunting intensity without depleting the sheep too quickly. However, with the wolf population at 52.00, a moderate increase in hunting is prudent to ensure we do not overexert ourselves and maintain a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.14, which is only 12.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize while still maintaining a presence in hunting. This gradual adjustment helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.92, which is only 11.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.98, which is only 10.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to support our population without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.55, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment helps maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can recover over time.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.15, which is only 10.1% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting without over-depleting the sheep, while also considering the current wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.01, which is only 10% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting.",

While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, a slight increase in hunting intensity will allow for some reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly.
