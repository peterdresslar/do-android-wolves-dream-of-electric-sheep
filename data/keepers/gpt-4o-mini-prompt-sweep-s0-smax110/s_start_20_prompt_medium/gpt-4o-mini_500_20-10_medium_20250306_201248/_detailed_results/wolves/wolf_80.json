A moderate theta will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can stabilize, promoting long-term coexistence.",

This moderate adjustment allows for sustainable coexistence while also considering the growing wolf population.",

However, the wolf population is also significant, and I want to avoid over-depleting the sheep. A gradual increase to 0.40 allows for sustainable hunting while still considering the long-term health of both populations.",

A theta of 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some growth in the wolf population.",

This adjustment aligns with the need for balance and avoids sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",

However, with the wolf population also being relatively high, I want to avoid overhunting and ensure that both populations can thrive. A gradual increase in theta will help maintain balance without risking a crash.",

While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, allowing for sustainable coexistence while still addressing the needs of my pack.",

This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 allows for more hunting intensity while still being cautious, as the wolf population is relatively high at 64.
