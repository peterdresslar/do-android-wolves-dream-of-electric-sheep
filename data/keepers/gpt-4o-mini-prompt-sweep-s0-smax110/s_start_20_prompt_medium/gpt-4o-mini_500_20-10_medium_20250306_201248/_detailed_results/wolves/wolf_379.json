            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This adjustment reflects a balanced approach, considering the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need to avoid overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 80.4% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate hunting approach. This will help maintain a balance between the wolf and sheep populations while avoiding overhunting. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.70, a slight decrease in hunting intensity will support the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach, as the wolf population is also significant, and we must avoid overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 41.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.66, it is important to maintain a balanced approach to ensure the long-term survival of both species. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while still supporting the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and while it is important to maintain a healthy wolf population, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta will help balance my hunting needs with the sustainability of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.22, which is only 24.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.35 to 0.40, I can focus on hunting while still allowing for the sheep to recover and ensuring the long-term survival of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.27, which is only 19.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support our wolf population without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.58, which is only 16.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of the wolf pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.23, which is only 13.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.4 to 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.38, which is only 12.2% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. A gradual increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, considering the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.21, which is only 11.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to recover while still enabling the wolf population to compete effectively. Gradually adjusting to a moderate theta helps maintain a balance between hunting and competition, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.31, which is only 10.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for sustainable cycles.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.80, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can focus more on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.42, which is only 9.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is a need to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support the wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach that promotes coexistence without depleting the sheep further."
