            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 68.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.27, it is essential to maintain a balance that allows both populations to thrive. A moderate theta of 0.3 will help reduce competition among wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual increase is necessary to maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment reflects a balance between ensuring our wolf population can thrive while still allowing the sheep to recover and maintain their numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the wolf population is relatively high. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still providing enough resources for the wolves. This approach maintains a balance and avoids depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.22, which is only 24.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for sustainable cycles.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.27, which is only 19.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight reduction from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still enabling some hunting to support our population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.58, which is only 16.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support our wolf population without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",

This suggests that we need to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a focus on competition with other wolves. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support our population without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",

This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for wolf sustenance with the long-term health of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.80, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some reproduction among wolves while still giving sheep a chance to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep population too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.42, which is only 9.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and promote sustainability.",

This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.400 to 0.35, I can focus on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.03, which is only 10% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover.
