            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.42, which is only 12.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to ensure our own survival. A theta of 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for some hunting without depleting the sheep further, while also considering the growing wolf population."
