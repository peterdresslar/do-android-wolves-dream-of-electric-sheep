Maintaining a lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, preventing overhunting and allowing for a sustainable balance.",

This slight increase from my previous theta reflects a cautious approach to capitalize on the sheep population while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep.",
