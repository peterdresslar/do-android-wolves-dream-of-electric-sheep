            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 32.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for gradual hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. The wolf population is relatively high, so a slight increase in hunting intensity will help sustain our pack while still allowing the sheep to recover. This moderate adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.69, which is only 25.2% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still being cautious. A gradual increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, enabling us to sustain our wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.57, which is only 19.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 allows for a balanced approach to hunting while still considering the need for wolf population stability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.71, which is only 16.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our own population. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for sustenance with the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.27, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.36, which is only 12.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.4 to 0.35, I can maintain a focus on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring a balance that supports both populations in the long term.",
