            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that a slight increase in hunting intensity is appropriate to maintain balance. However, given the current wolf population, I must be cautious and avoid overhunting, so I will make a gradual adjustment to ensure sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 93.9% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, I must remain cautious and avoid drastic changes to ensure the sustainability of both the sheep and wolf populations. A gradual increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach that supports my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still healthy at 84.2% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 48, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.41, it indicates that while hunting can be increased, caution is necessary to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for competition among wolves while still enabling some hunting, promoting a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 45.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 68, which is relatively high, I need to be cautious about overhunting. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain their numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 37.88, which is only 34.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for more hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious to avoid over-exploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 29.68, which is only 27.0% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, allowing both populations to stabilize without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.42, which is only 21.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is an opportunity to increase hunting intensity, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 allows for a balanced approach that supports wolf reproduction while still considering the sustainability of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.91, which is only 17.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack without depleting the sheep further, promoting a more balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.44, which is only 14.9% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will enable me to hunt more effectively without depleting the sheep too quickly, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.31, which is only 13.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.4 to 0.35, I can still maintain some hunting intensity while focusing on reducing competition with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.06, which is only 11.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach to hunting while still being cautious of the wolf population growth.",

This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still ensuring our own survival. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting without depleting the sheep population too quickly, promoting a sustainable balance."
