This indicates that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while also considering the need to compete with other wolves as the population is relatively high at 67. I aim to maintain a balance that supports both species in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.55, which is only 18.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I need to maintain some hunting to support wolf reproduction, I should prioritize a more cautious approach to allow the sheep population to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a balance that encourages coexistence while still allowing for some hunting.",
