            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 36\n- Sheep population: 99.86\n- Wolf population: 44.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.291\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 2.27 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 90.8% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 90.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with a wolf population of 44, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is relatively high at 2.27, suggesting that we should not overhunt to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase in theta to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting sustainable coexistence while still enabling some hunting to support our wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help sustain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual increase aligns with the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and avoids sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover and thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term survival of both species. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to ensure that the sheep can recover while maintaining a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 41.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 32.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.52, it is important to maintain a balanced approach to ensure the long-term survival of both species. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while still enabling the wolf population to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.10, which is only 25.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.33, which is only 20.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. With a wolf population of 63, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is low, indicating competition among wolves is high. A theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still permitting some hunting to sustain our population without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.89, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking over-depletion. This adjustment supports our immediate need for food while still considering the long-term sustainability of both sheep and wolf populations. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.35 aligns with the wisdom of making small adjustments in response to current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.19, which is only 14.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, ensuring that we do not deplete the sheep further while still competing effectively with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.14, which is only 12.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.92, which is only 11.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support our wolf population without depleting the sheep further, promoting a more sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.98, which is only 10.9% of its maximum capacity. Given the high wolf population of 37.00, a lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species and prevents overhunting.",
