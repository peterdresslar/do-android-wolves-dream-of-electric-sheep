            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A slight reduction in hunting will help maintain the balance between wolves and sheep, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 4.07, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover. This will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and a slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain the balance without depleting their numbers too quickly. This moderate adjustment allows for sustainable coexistence while also considering the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while still maintaining a sustainable balance with the sheep population. It reflects a cautious approach to adapt to the current conditions, ensuring both species can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help sustain our wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A balanced approach is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly and to maintain harmony in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while it is beneficial to increase hunting slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must also be cautious not to deplete the sheep too quickly. A moderate approach allows for coexistence while still enabling the wolf population to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.69, it indicates that we should be cautious in our hunting to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.89, which is only 32.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.69, which is only 25.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance, reducing hunting intensity slightly to support sheep recovery without drastically impacting wolf numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.57, which is only 19.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.71, which is only 16.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population and maintaining a balance with the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.27, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted to help sustain our population. However, given the relatively high wolf population of 53, I must be cautious and avoid overhunting. A gradual increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach that supports both sheep recovery and wolf survival."
