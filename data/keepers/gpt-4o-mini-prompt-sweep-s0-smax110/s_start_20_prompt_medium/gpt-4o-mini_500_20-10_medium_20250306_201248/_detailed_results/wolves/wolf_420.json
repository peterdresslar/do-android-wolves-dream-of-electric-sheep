            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at its maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A theta of 0.4 strikes a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can stabilize, promoting long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. A moderate approach will help maintain the balance between wolf and sheep populations while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. With a high sheep-to-wolf ratio and a growing wolf population, it is prudent to focus on competition among wolves rather than aggressive hunting, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery. Maintaining a lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, while also preventing overexploitation of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow the sheep to recover. Maintaining a lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both species and prevent overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be cautiously increased to prevent over-depletion. However, with the wolf population at 28, I must also consider the competition among wolves. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting sustainability while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. With a high sheep-to-wolf ratio, focusing on competition with other wolves will help maintain our population without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and while I want to increase hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of the wolf population.",

This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still healthy at 97.70, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction. However, since the wolf population is also significant at 46, I want to avoid overhunting and ensure the sheep can recover. A gradual increase to 0.45 strikes a balance between competing with other wolves and maintaining the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach, ensuring that we do not over-deplete the sheep while also considering the gradual increase in wolf numbers.",

A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling us to maintain our numbers.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.34, which is only 28.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance and ensure the long-term survival of both species.",

A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of the wolf population.",
