            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 89.1% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover if needed. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still below maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover without being overly depleted. A gradual approach is essential to maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicating a slight competition for resources, a moderate theta will help maintain the sheep population while allowing for some hunting to support wolf reproduction. This gradual adjustment will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level relative to the maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity slightly to allow the sheep to recover while still competing with other wolves. This moderate approach will help maintain a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 33.32, which is only 30.3% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still being cautious. By raising theta to 0.40, I can promote wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a balance and responding to the current state of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.06, which is only 23.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is a need to hunt to support the wolf population, it is crucial to avoid overhunting to allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance and promote sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.97, which is only 19.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without over-depleting the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.63, which is only 16.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, reducing pressure on the sheep while still enabling us to compete effectively with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.36, which is only 14.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.71, which is only 12.5% of its maximum capacity. A moderate approach allows for some hunting while also giving the sheep a chance to recover. This balance is crucial for the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, especially as the wolf population is relatively high.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.56, which is only 11.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still being mindful of the need to avoid overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.82, which is only 10.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining some hunting to support our wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach without over-depleting the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.30, which is only 10.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is an opportunity for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to overhunt."
