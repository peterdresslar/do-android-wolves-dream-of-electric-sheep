            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 117\n- Sheep population: 12.19\n- Wolf population: 42.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.350\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.29 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 11.1% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and while I want to ensure the wolves can reproduce, I also need to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly, considering the current wolf population is stable.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while maintaining a sustainable balance with the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still healthy at 91, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while maintaining a balance. However, with the wolf population at 49, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the wolf population is slightly high. A moderate hunting intensity will allow for some sheep recovery while also ensuring that the wolf population does not grow too rapidly. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and while it is important to maintain a healthy wolf population, I need to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.40 will help balance hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring that we do not deplete the sheep further while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.69, which is only 25.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it is crucial to maintain a balance to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.57, which is only 19.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.71, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a significant competition for resources. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.27, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase in hunting intensity to 0.40 will help maintain a balance, allowing for some reproduction among wolves while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.36, which is only 12.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.4 to 0.35, I can maintain a focus on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.19, which is only 11.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly."
