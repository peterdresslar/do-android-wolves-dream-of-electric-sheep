            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at its maximum capacity, and while I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also be cautious not to deplete the sheep too quickly. A moderate increase in hunting intensity allows for some reproduction among wolves while still considering the sustainability of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at its maximum capacity, and while I need to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A moderate theta value will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can stabilize, preventing future crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. A lower theta will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can stabilize, which is crucial for the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is near its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking immediate depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term survival for both.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing sustainability. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to maintain balance as the sheep population is recovering, while also considering the growth of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, promoting sustainable coexistence while still allowing for wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 55.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.95, it is crucial to maintain a balanced approach to ensure the long-term survival of both species. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still supporting the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must do so gradually to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that considers both the current sheep population and the growing wolf numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.89, which is only 32.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.40 allows for a slight increase in hunting while still prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.69, which is only 25.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.57, which is only 19.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to allow for recovery. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the sustainability of both sheep and wolves, ensuring that we do not deplete the sheep population too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.71, which is only 16.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting to support the wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach that promotes coexistence without depleting the sheep further."
