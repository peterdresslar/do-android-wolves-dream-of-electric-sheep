            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 41.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, it is wise to maintain a cautious approach to avoid over-depleting the sheep while still allowing for some hunting to support wolf reproduction. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced strategy that considers both current needs and long-term sustainability.",

This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual increase aligns with the current trends and ensures we do not disrupt the delicate balance.",

However, with the wolf population at 68, it is wise to maintain a moderate hunting intensity to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly while still allowing for some reproduction among wolves. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",

This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach that considers both the need for wolf population sustainability and the recovery of the sheep.",
