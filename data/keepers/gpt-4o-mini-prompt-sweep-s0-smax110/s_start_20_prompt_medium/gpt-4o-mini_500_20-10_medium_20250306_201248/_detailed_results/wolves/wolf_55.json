            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 79.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep. However, with the wolf population at 53, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is relatively high at 1.64, suggesting that we should focus more on competition with other wolves to avoid overhunting. A moderate theta of 0.3 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the stability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 67.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for increased hunting without risking depletion. However, with the wolf population at 60, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A moderate increase to 0.45 allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some growth in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the wolf population is also relatively high. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to thrive. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 41.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a wolf population of 69, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is low, suggesting that if I increase hunting intensity too much, it could lead to a rapid decline in sheep numbers. A slight reduction in hunting intensity allows for some recovery of the sheep while still enabling wolves to maintain their population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 32.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 25.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 67, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both populations can thrive. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for more hunting while still considering the long-term balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.33, which is only 20.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is potential for recovery if we reduce our hunting intensity. By adopting a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.89, which is only 17.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.19, which is only 14.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach that can help both populations recover sustainably.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.14, which is only 12.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that the sheep need time to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus more on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This gradual adjustment will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be increased slightly to ensure the wolves can sustain themselves. However, I must be cautious and avoid overhunting, as the sheep population is still recovering. A gradual increase allows for a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.98, which is only 10.9% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, reducing hunting intensity while still competing with other wolves.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.15, which is only 10.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting sustainability while still being mindful of the need to compete with other wolves.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.14, which is only 10.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to gradually increase. This approach aligns with the wisdom of ensuring long-term survival and avoiding sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.28, which is only 10.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population.
