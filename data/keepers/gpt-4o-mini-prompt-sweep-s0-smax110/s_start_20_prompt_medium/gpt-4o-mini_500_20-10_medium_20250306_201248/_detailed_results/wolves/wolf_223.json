            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at maximum capacity, and while I want to maintain a healthy wolf population, I also need to ensure that the sheep can recover. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will allow for some reproduction among wolves while still giving sheep a chance to stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A balanced approach will help maintain the sheep population while ensuring the wolf pack remains healthy. This adjustment reflects a gradual shift towards sustainability, considering both current conditions and future implications.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. A lower theta will help balance the competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to stabilize and grow, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 4.23, it is crucial to focus on competition among wolves rather than depleting the sheep further. This approach will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at maximum capacity, and maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover and prevents overexploitation. This approach supports the long-term survival of both species while allowing for gradual adjustments in response to future population changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that we should be cautious with our hunting to avoid depleting their numbers too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support our population while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a sustainable balance. This adjustment will help support the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 98.01, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction. However, I must remain cautious and avoid overhunting, as the sheep population is approaching its maximum capacity. A gradual increase to 0.45 allows for sustainable coexistence while still considering the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 78.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that while there is a healthy number of sheep, we should avoid overhunting to ensure their recovery. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a more balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still maintaining some hunting to support our population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover gradually.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 50.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.83, it is wise to focus slightly more on competition with other wolves to ensure our population remains stable while allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 30.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, the wolf population is relatively high, and to ensure long-term sustainability, I need to focus more on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of sheep and maintaining a balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.06, which is only 23.7% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still being cautious. A theta of 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, enabling me to maintain the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover gradually.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.97, which is only 19.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for the sheep to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This gradual adjustment helps maintain a balance between hunting and competition, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.63, which is only 16.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I can increase my hunting intensity slightly, I must be cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate increase to 0.40 allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery."
