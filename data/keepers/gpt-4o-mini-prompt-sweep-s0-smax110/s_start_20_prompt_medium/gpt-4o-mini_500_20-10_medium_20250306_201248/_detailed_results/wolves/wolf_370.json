            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 400\n- Sheep population: 12.21\n- Wolf population: 41.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.350\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.30 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 11.1% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is close to its maximum capacity, indicating that they can sustain some hunting without immediate risk of depletion. However, with a relatively high wolf population, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight reduction from my previous theta allows for continued hunting while also considering the need for balance and sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still healthy at 91.1% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover if needed. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 80.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.70, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 53.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still a reasonable number of sheep available for hunting. However, with the wolf population at 66, which is relatively high compared to the sheep, I need to ensure that I do not overhunt and deplete the sheep population too quickly. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for some hunting while still focusing on maintaining a balance and avoiding competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 41.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, which is relatively high, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that supports both sheep recovery and wolf population stability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support the wolf population without risking the depletion of sheep, ensuring long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.22, which is only 24.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to allow for recovery. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.27, which is only 19.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still recognizing the need to adjust as the populations change.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.58, which is only 16.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support our wolf population, but it also prioritizes the sustainability of the sheep, ensuring a balance that can lead to long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.23, which is only 13.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I need to be cautious about overhunting, I can afford to increase my hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction. A theta of 0.40 allows for a moderate approach, balancing the need to hunt with the importance of allowing the sheep population to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.38, which is only 12.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support our wolf population without risking a further decline in the sheep numbers, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.21, which is only 11.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some replenishment of the sheep while still maintaining a focus on the wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach that supports both species without risking a crash."
