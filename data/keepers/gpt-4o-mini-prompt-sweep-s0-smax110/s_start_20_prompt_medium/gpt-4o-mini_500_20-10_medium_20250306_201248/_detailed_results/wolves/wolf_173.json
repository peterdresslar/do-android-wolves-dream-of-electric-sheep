            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 188\n- Sheep population: 11.93\n- Wolf population: 38.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.400\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.31 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 10.8% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that can sustain both populations. This value reflects a balanced approach, ensuring that while I can hunt effectively, I also allow the sheep to recover and maintain their numbers. It is important to avoid overhunting as the wolf population is stable, and a gradual adjustment will help prevent any drastic changes in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 84.2% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a sustainable balance. This adjustment will help support the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly, considering the current dynamics of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 57.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a more cautious approach, balancing the need to compete with other wolves while still enabling the sheep population to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 45.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 68, which is relatively high, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 37.88, which is only 34.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is some room for hunting, it is crucial to avoid overexploitation to allow the sheep population to recover. A moderate theta of 0.375 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 29.68, which is only 27.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring both populations can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.42, which is only 21.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep have a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.91, which is only 17.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.4 to 0.35, I can still maintain some hunting activity while prioritizing the sustainability of both populations. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.44, which is only 14.9% of its maximum capacity. While I need to hunt to ensure the survival of my pack, I must also be cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, enabling sustainable coexistence while still considering the need for gradual adjustments as conditions change.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.31, which is only 13.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support our wolf population without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.06, which is only 11.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support our reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a more balanced approach, ensuring both wolves and sheep can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.93, which is only 10.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a lower hunting intensity is necessary to allow the sheep to recover. Additionally, with a wolf population of 38, focusing more on competition among wolves rather than aggressive hunting will help maintain our numbers while giving the sheep a chance to rebound. A gradual adjustment to 0.35 reflects a balanced approach that considers both immediate needs and long-term sustainability."
