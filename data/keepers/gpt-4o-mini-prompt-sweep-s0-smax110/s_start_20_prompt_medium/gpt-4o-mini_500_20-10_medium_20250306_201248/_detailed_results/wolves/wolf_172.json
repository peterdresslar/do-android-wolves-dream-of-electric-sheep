            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 188\n- Sheep population: 11.93\n- Wolf population: 38.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.350\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.31 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 10.8% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still healthy at 93.9% of maximum capacity, allowing for some increased hunting intensity without risking depletion. However, I want to avoid overhunting as the wolf population is also significant, so a moderate reduction from my previous theta will help maintain balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still healthy at 92.66, allowing for some increased hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction. However, I must remain cautious as the wolf population is relatively stable, and I want to avoid over-depleting the sheep. A moderate increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance while still allowing for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain our wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and maintain their numbers. A gradual adjustment is key to avoiding overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 57.9% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term survival for both.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 45.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, the wolf population is relatively high, so a moderate approach is necessary to avoid over-depletion of the sheep while still allowing for some hunting to support wolf reproduction. This balance will help maintain both populations over the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and while I want to ensure the survival of my pack, I also recognize the need for the sheep to recover. A moderate theta allows for some hunting to support reproduction while avoiding over-depletion of the sheep population. This balance will help maintain a sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 29.68, which is only 27.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is some opportunity for hunting, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease from my previous theta of 0.450 will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.42, which is only 21.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for moderate hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.91, which is only 17.2% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, allowing for sustainable coexistence without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.44, which is only 14.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for wolf sustenance while avoiding overhunting that could lead to a crash in the sheep population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.31, which is only 13.0% of its maximum capacity. While I need to focus on hunting to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a more balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the immediate needs of the wolf pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.06, which is only 11.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to support our population without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.93, which is only 10.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a more balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for wolves to reproduce."
