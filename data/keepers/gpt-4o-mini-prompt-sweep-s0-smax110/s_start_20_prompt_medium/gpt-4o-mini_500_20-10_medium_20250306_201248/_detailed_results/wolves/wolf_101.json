            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 117\n- Sheep population: 12.19\n- Wolf population: 42.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.400\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.29 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 11.1% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. A lower theta allows for more competition among wolves, which can help control our numbers while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 93.3% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This approach balances the need for wolf reproduction while ensuring that the sheep population can recover and sustain itself. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.25 allows for adaptation to the current conditions without risking a sudden depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently healthy at 91, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 49, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both species can thrive. A gradual increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach that supports sustainable coexistence while still allowing for some reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, I must remain cautious and avoid overexploitation. A gradual increase to 0.45 reflects a balanced approach that supports both wolf reproduction and the sustainability of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 55.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With the wolf population also being relatively high, a slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. This moderate approach supports sustainable coexistence and avoids the risks of overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 43.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure our long-term survival. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on maintaining balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.89, which is only 32.6% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.69, which is only 25.2% of its maximum capacity. While I need to maintain a focus on hunting to support the wolf population, I must also be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting sustainability while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.57, which is only 19.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from the previous theta of 0.450 to 0.35, I can still maintain some hunting activity while prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both populations. This moderate adjustment reflects a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.71, which is only 16.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach that supports wolf reproduction while still giving sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.27, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support our wolf population without risking the depletion of the sheep, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.36, which is only 12.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is an opportunity for hunting, it is crucial to avoid overexploitation. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still giving sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.19, which is only 11.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for wolf sustenance with the long-term survival of both species."
