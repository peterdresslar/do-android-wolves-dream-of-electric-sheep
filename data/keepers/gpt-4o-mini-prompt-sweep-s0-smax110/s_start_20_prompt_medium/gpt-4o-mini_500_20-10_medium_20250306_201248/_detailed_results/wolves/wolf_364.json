            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 399\n- Sheep population: 13.38\n- Wolf population: 47.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.400\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.28 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 12.2% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity slightly to allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition with other wolves. This moderate approach will help maintain a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and a slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly. This moderate adjustment allows for sustainable coexistence while also considering the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is close to its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still promoting sustainability. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 100.21, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 80.4% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a sustainable coexistence as the wolf population is also growing.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment reflects a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. It is crucial to maintain a dynamic equilibrium as both populations fluctuate.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 53.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population being slightly higher than the sheep population, I need to prioritize balance and avoid overhunting. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring both populations can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while it is beneficial to increase hunting slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep too quickly. A moderate adjustment allows for a balanced approach, ensuring both populations can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.22, which is only 24.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is some opportunity for hunting, it is crucial to prioritize the recovery of the sheep population to ensure long-term sustainability. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain its health.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.27, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations while ensuring our pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.58, which is only 16.0% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing competition with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the wolf population is relatively high. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help sustain our population while allowing the sheep to recover gradually. This approach aligns with the wisdom of making small adjustments to maintain balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.38, which is only 12.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a presence in the hunting cycle. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, reducing competition with other wolves while ensuring that we do not over-deplete the sheep population."
