A moderate approach allows for some hunting while still enabling the sheep to recover and maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover and ensures that our wolf population can thrive in the long term without depleting our primary food source.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in sheep numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover and ensures the long-term survival of both species. Additionally, with the wolf population at 26, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover while keeping the wolf population stable. This approach supports long-term coexistence and prevents overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that a slight increase in hunting intensity is appropriate to maintain balance. However, I must be cautious and avoid overhunting, as the wolf population is relatively stable. A gradual increase allows for sustainable coexistence while ensuring that both populations can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and a slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain our wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. This gradual adjustment allows for sustainable coexistence while also considering the current trends in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 98.01, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction without overly depleting the sheep, ensuring both populations can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still maintaining a sustainable balance with the sheep population. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the fact that the sheep population is at 78.7% of its maximum capacity, a gradual increase in hunting intensity is appropriate to ensure long-term survival for both species.",

However, with the wolf population at 70, which is relatively high, I need to be cautious about overhunting. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain a healthy population.",

However, with the wolf population at 70, I need to be cautious not to overhunt and risk depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still considering the long-term balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.06, which is only 23.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own population. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity and promote a sustainable balance, allowing both populations to thrive in the long run.",
