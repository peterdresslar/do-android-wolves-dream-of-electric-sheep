            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.66, which is only 9.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that the sheep need time to recover, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to bounce back while still enabling the wolf population to compete effectively. A gradual adjustment helps maintain balance without risking a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.42, which is only 9.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is a need to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a slight focus on hunting to support our wolf population.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.32, which is only 9.4% of its maximum capacity.
