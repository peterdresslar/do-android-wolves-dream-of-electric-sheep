            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 472\n- Sheep population: 12.17\n- Wolf population: 40.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.400\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.30 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 11.1% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is close to its maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity while still ensuring their recovery. This balance helps maintain a sustainable ecosystem and supports the wolf population without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 97.70, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep do not become over-depleted. A gradual approach is essential to maintain balance and avoid sudden population crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, but I need to ensure that we do not overhunt and deplete their numbers. A moderate approach allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some hunting to support our wolf population. This adjustment reflects the need to balance our immediate hunting needs with the long-term health of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, but the wolf population is also significant. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling us to compete effectively with other wolves. This approach supports sustainable coexistence and avoids over-depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 48.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to prevent a crash in the sheep population. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for more hunting while still maintaining a balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level (37.2% of maximum capacity), and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are not enough sheep to support aggressive hunting. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while still giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring a sustainable balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.34, which is only 28.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population and maintaining a balance with the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.52, which is only 23.2% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still being cautious. A small adjustment from 0.350 to 0.40 helps maintain a balance between hunting and allowing the sheep population to recover, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.37, which is only 18.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A gradual adjustment to 0.35 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for some hunting without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a more balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.75, which is only 13.4% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach that balances competition with other wolves and the need for sustainable sheep population growth.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.37, which is only 12.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should be cautious with our hunting to allow the sheep to recover. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.30, there is still a need to increase our hunting slightly to ensure our own survival and reproduction. A gradual increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach that supports both our needs and the recovery of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.17, which is only 11.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.400 to 0.35, I can maintain a focus on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring a balance that supports both populations in the long term."
