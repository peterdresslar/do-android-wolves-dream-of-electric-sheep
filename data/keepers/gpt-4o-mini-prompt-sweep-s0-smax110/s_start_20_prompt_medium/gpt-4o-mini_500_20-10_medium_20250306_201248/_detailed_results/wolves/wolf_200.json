            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 57.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain the balance between wolves and sheep while allowing for some growth in the wolf population. This adjustment is gradual, aligning with the wisdom of small changes for long-term stability.",
