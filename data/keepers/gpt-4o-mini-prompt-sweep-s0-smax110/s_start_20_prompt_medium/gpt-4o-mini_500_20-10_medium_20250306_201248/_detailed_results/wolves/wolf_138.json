            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 47.66, which is only 43.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. By increasing theta slightly from my previous value, I can focus on hunting while still allowing for the sheep population to recover. This moderate approach aligns with my goal of maintaining a sustainable balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.89, which is only 32.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that I can afford to increase my hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A gradual increase to 0.40 strikes a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring both populations can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.69, which is only 25.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.57, which is only 19.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing our wolf population. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure and promote a more sustainable balance, allowing both populations to stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.71, which is only 16.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some replenishment of the sheep population while still ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without risking a rapid depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.27, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking the depletion of the sheep population, fostering a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.36, which is only 12.1% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will enable me to hunt more effectively while still prioritizing the sustainability of both populations.
