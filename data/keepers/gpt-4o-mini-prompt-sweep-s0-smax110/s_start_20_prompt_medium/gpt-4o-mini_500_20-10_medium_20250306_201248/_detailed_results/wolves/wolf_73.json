            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 41.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a wolf population of 69, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is low, suggesting that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while maintaining a competitive stance among wolves. A gradual increase in theta will help balance hunting and competition, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
