            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. With a high sheep-to-wolf ratio, focusing on competition with other wolves will help stabilize the wolf population while ensuring the ecosystem remains balanced.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery and prevent depletion. Maintaining a focus on competition with other wolves will help stabilize the wolf population while ensuring the sheep can bounce back.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition with other wolves. A gradual decrease in theta will help maintain balance without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while also reducing competition among wolves. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between the wolf and sheep populations, promoting coexistence while ensuring the wolf pack can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 97.70, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while maintaining a sustainable balance. This adjustment reflects the need to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly. A gradual increase helps ensure that both populations can thrive together.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of my ancestors, promoting a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for moderate hunting without risking depletion. This value reflects a balanced approach, enabling us to maintain our wolf population while ensuring the sheep can recover and thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 48.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to prevent a crash in the sheep population. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, focusing on coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 37.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for gradual hunting without risking depletion. Given the current wolf population, a slight increase in hunting intensity will help sustain our numbers while allowing the sheep to recover. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.34, which is only 28.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By adopting a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.52, which is only 23.2% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking the sheep population too severely. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain balance while allowing for some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.37, which is only 18.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for the sheep to recover. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to stabilize while still competing with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.17, which is only 15.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. By increasing theta slightly from 0.35 to 0.40, I can focus on hunting while still allowing for some recovery of the sheep population. This moderate approach helps maintain a balance between the wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term survival for both.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.75, which is only 13.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to stabilize while still enabling the wolf population to compete effectively. A gradual adjustment towards a more balanced approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both species."
