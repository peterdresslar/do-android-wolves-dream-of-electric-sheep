            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 67.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.23, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover. A gradual increase in theta will help maintain a sustainable balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 53.6% of its maximum capacity, which indicates that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population being slightly higher than the sheep population, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A moderate increase in theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves to maintain balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 41.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both populations can thrive. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for wolves to reproduce.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 32.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a wolf population of 69, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is low, suggesting that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while maintaining a stable wolf population. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help balance the ecosystem and ensure long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 25.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 67, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both populations can thrive. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach while still considering the need for gradual adjustments.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.33, which is only 20.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is potential for recovery if we reduce hunting intensity. By lowering theta to 0.35, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow, while still maintaining a presence in the hunting aspect.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.89, which is only 17.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is potential for recovery if I reduce hunting intensity slightly. By increasing theta only moderately to 0.40, I can still hunt effectively while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow, ensuring a sustainable balance between both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.19, which is only 14.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting while prioritizing the long-term balance of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.14, which is only 12.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is potential for recovery if I reduce hunting intensity slightly. By increasing theta from 0.35 to 0.40, I can maintain a balanced approach that allows for some hunting while also giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.92, which is only 11.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 reflects a slight increase in hunting compared to my previous value, acknowledging the need to balance our population dynamics without over-depleting the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.98, which is only 10.9% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting sheep. This will help maintain the balance and prevent a crash in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.55, which is only 10.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a slight hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A small increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach that considers both the immediate need for food and the long-term sustainability of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderate to allow for recovery. This adjustment helps ensure the long-term survival of both sheep and wolves while avoiding overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.01, which is only 10% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, ensuring both species can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.14, which is only 10.1% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.28, which is only 10.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A moderate increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach, ensuring sustainability without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.50, which is only 10.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to increase. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.82, which is only 10.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting without risking depletion.
