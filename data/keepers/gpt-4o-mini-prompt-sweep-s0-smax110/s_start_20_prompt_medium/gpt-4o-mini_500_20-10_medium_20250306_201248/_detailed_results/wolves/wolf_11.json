            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 84.5% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A gradual increase is essential to maintain balance and avoid sudden crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 89.8% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This approach maintains a sustainable balance between both populations, avoiding overhunting and allowing for future growth.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and while it is important to maintain a healthy wolf population, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will help balance the ecosystem and prevent over-depletion of the sheep, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover and prevent overexploitation. This lower theta will help maintain a balance while also considering the potential for future increases in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at its maximum capacity, and maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover and prevents overexploitation. This approach also helps to stabilize the wolf population as we focus on competition with other wolves rather than aggressive hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at its maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery and prevent depletion. Maintaining a lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep while allowing for gradual adjustments in response to future population changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution in hunting to prevent depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",

This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while maintaining a sustainable balance with the sheep population. It reflects a cautious approach to ensure long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 79.0% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to maintain balance, considering the current wolf population and the need to avoid over-depleting the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, I must remain cautious and avoid overhunting, as the wolf population is also significant. A gradual increase helps maintain balance while ensuring both populations can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, and while I want to ensure the wolves can thrive, I also need to allow the sheep to recover.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.10, which is only 25.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep population too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.33, which is only 20.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize.
