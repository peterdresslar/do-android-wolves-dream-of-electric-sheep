            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 118\n- Sheep population: 11.23\n- Wolf population: 37.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.400\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.30 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 10.2% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 93.3% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain our wolf population while ensuring that we do not deplete the sheep too quickly. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently healthy at 91, which allows for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. However, I must remain cautious and avoid overhunting, as the wolf population is also significant. A theta of 0.75 strikes a balance between ensuring our pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing sheep to recover. A gradual approach is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that can support wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep population does not decline too rapidly. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and adapting to the current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 43.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to prevent a crash in the sheep population. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring both species can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 32.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for recovery. With a wolf population of 70, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is low, suggesting that we should focus on competing with other wolves to allow the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help maintain a balance and prevent overhunting, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.69, which is only 25.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I can increase my hunting intensity slightly, I must do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A small increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the sustainability of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.57, which is only 19.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is room for some hunting to support wolf reproduction, we must be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A moderate increase in hunting intensity allows for a gradual balance that can help both populations recover without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.71, which is only 16.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is a need for hunting to support wolf reproduction, it is crucial to avoid overhunting to allow the sheep population to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.27, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, a slight increase in hunting intensity to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach that supports both the wolves",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.36, which is only 12.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to allow for recovery. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting while still prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both sheep and wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.19, which is only 11.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.23, which is only 10.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing more on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species."
