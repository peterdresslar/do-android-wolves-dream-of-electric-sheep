            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that we should reduce hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate approach will help maintain a balance between our population and the sheep, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly. It",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 93.9% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 84.2% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 48, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while I want to ensure my pack thrives, I also recognize the importance of allowing the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and prevent over-depletion of the sheep population, ensuring long-term survival for both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery. A moderate increase from my previous theta allows for gradual adaptation to the current ecosystem state.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 45.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.73, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover gradually.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 29.68, which is only 27.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 reflects a focus on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.42, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking over-depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a balance as the sheep population is recovering, while also considering the growing wolf population. A gradual increase in theta will support sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.91, which is only 17.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased slightly, it is crucial to avoid overexploitation. A moderate increase to 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population and maintaining a balance with the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.44, which is only 14.9% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, a slight increase in hunting intensity will help balance the needs of both species without depleting the sheep too quickly. This moderate adjustment allows for sustainable coexistence while still responding to the current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.31, which is only 13.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.06, which is only 11.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some recovery while still ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting sustainability without risking over-depletion of the sheep."
