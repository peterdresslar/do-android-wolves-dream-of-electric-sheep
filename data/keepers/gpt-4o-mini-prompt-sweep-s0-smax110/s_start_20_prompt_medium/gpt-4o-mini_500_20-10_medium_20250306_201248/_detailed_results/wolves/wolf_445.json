            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 474\n- Sheep population: 10.94\n- Wolf population: 31.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.400\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.35 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 9.9% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 97.70, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are enough sheep to support a moderate hunting intensity. By setting theta at 0.55, I can maintain a balance that allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves. This approach helps prevent over-depletion of the sheep population while also considering the gradual increase in wolf numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 76.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.54, it is essential to maintain a balance to prevent overhunting and ensure the long-term survival of both species. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for sustainable hunting while also considering the growth of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while it is beneficial to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must also consider the recent growth in wolf numbers. A moderate adjustment allows for continued coexistence without risking a rapid decline in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level (37.2% of maximum capacity) and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are more wolves competing for fewer sheep. By lowering my hunting intensity slightly, I can allow the sheep population to recover while still maintaining a focus on competition with other wolves. This approach supports long-term sustainability and prevents overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.34, which is only 28.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.52, which is only 23.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A moderate increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.37, which is only 18.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By lowering my hunting intensity slightly, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some sustainable hunting. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.17, which is only 15.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for gradual hunting without risking depletion. However, with a wolf population of 56, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that supports both sheep recovery and wolf sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.75, which is only 13.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for wolf sustenance with the need to support the sheep population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.37, which is only 12.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is an opportunity to increase hunting intensity slightly to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A gradual increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of the wolf pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.17, which is only 11.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.4 to 0.35, I can maintain a focus on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring a balance that supports both populations in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.50, which is only 10.5% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help me maintain a balance between hunting and allowing the sheep to grow, avoiding overexploitation while still supporting wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.94, which is only 9.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our needs without depleting the sheep further, promoting a more balanced ecosystem."
