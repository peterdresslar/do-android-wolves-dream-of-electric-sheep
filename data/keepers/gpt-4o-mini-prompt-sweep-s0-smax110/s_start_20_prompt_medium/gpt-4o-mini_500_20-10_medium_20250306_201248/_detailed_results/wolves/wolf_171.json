            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 188\n- Sheep population: 11.93\n- Wolf population: 38.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.400\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.31 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 10.8% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and I want to maintain a balanced approach that allows for sustainable coexistence. The current sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that while hunting can be increased, it should be done gradually to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. This theta value reflects a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term survival of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 84.2% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate hunting approach. This will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations while avoiding overhunting. A slight decrease from my previous theta reflects a cautious response to the growing wolf population, ensuring we do not deplete the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 72.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep. However, the wolf population is also significant, and I want to avoid overhunting to ensure sustainability. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow for better coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 57.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for more hunting while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep. This approach helps maintain a healthy wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 45.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a wolf population of 68, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is relatively low at 0.73, suggesting that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. This approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both species and avoid depleting the sheep population too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 37.88, which is only 34.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is still room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach to hunting while still considering the need to compete with other wolves as the population grows.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 29.68, which is only 27.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is some room for hunting, I need to be cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach to hunting while still considering the need for sheep recovery and the overall health of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.42, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a need for caution in hunting. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a more balanced approach, giving sheep a chance to recover while still enabling wolves to thrive. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.91, which is only 17.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is some opportunity for hunting, it is crucial to allow the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 to 0.35 reflects a more cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain wolf health. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.44, which is only 14.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.31, which is only 13.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support reproduction, but not so much that it further depletes the sheep. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.06, which is only 11.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is some opportunity for hunting, I need to be cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting to support the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.93, which is only 10.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population without depleting the sheep further."
