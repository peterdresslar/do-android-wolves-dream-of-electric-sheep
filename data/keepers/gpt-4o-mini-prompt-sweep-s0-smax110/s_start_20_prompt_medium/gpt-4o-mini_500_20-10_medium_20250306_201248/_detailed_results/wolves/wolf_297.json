            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to prevent depletion. A balanced approach allows for sustainable coexistence while also considering the gradual increase in wolf numbers. This theta value reflects a cautious strategy that supports both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A lower theta will help balance competition with other wolves while preventing overhunting of sheep, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while also managing the competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing sheep to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while ensuring that we do not deplete their numbers too quickly. This adjustment reflects a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction without jeopardizing the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 76.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, the wolf population is also significant at 54, which suggests that we need to be cautious about overhunting. A slight reduction in hunting intensity allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while I want to increase my hunting to support wolf reproduction, I must do so gradually to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that considers both the current sheep population and the need for wolf survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 51.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 66.00, it is wise to focus on competition among wolves to prevent overhunting and allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain balance while ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction without significantly depleting the sheep population, ensuring long-term coexistence.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.9% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a need for caution. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will allow for some recovery of the sheep while still supporting the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.55, which is only 18.7% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach that balances competition with other wolves and the need to sustain the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.20, which is only 15.6% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.35 helps maintain a balance as the sheep population recovers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.73, which is only 13.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack without depleting the sheep further, promoting a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.20, which is only 12.0% of its maximum capacity.
