            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. With a high sheep-to-wolf ratio, focusing on competition with other wolves will help maintain our population while giving the sheep a chance to rebound.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery and prevent depletion. Maintaining a focus on competition with other wolves will help stabilize our population while ensuring the sheep can rebound.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover and prevents overexploitation. Given the current balance, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is very close to its maximum capacity, indicating that we should be cautious with our hunting to avoid depleting their numbers too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that supports both the wolf population and the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and a slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep too quickly. This moderate adjustment allows for sustainable coexistence while still supporting the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 98.01, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is key to maintaining balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while I want to increase hunting to support wolf reproduction, I must also consider the potential for overhunting. A moderate approach allows for some hunting while ensuring the sheep can recover and maintain a healthy population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term survival of both species. This moderate adjustment helps maintain a balance as the wolf population is also growing, ensuring we do not deplete the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level relative to the maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 33.32, which is only 30.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.06, which is only 23.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own wolf population. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, ensuring both species can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.97, which is only 19.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.63, which is only 16.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.36, which is only 14.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.35 to 0.40, I can still maintain a balance that supports wolf reproduction while giving sheep a chance to stabilize. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of avoiding sudden changes and responding to the current state of the ecosystem."
