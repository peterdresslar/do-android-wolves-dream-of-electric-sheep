            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. With a high sheep-to-wolf ratio and a growing wolf population, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderate to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in sheep numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition with other wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover while also keeping the wolf population in check. This balanced approach supports long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and a slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain the balance without depleting their numbers too quickly. This adjustment allows for some growth in the wolf population while still being cautious about the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is close to its maximum capacity, indicating that they can sustain some hunting pressure without significant depletion. However, with the wolf population also being relatively stable, a slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain our numbers while still allowing for sheep recovery. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of gradual changes to ensure a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 97.70, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while maintaining a sustainable balance. This adjustment will help ensure the wolf population remains robust without over-depleting the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 84.45, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we have enough sheep to sustain our pack without overhunting. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a more cautious approach, ensuring that we do not deplete the sheep too quickly while still allowing for some hunting to support our wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing sheep to recover. It",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 48.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.77, it is wise to maintain a moderate hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while also ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. This small adjustment from my previous theta will help sustain both populations without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a sustainable balance. This adjustment will help support the wolf population without overly depleting the sheep, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.34, which is only 28.5% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing competition with other wolves, thus promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.52, which is only 23.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.37, which is only 18.5% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.17, which is only 15.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some reproduction among wolves while still giving sheep a chance to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without risking a rapid depletion of the sheep population."
