            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 402\n- Sheep population: 10.80\n- Wolf population: 32.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.400\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.34 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 9.8% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3. Adjust your hunting intensity gradually in response to population changes\n4. Find a balance that creates sustainable cycles rather than crashes\n5.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we have enough prey to sustain our pack without overhunting. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover and ensure our long-term survival while also keeping our wolf numbers in check.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 80.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain the balance between wolf and sheep populations, allowing for gradual growth in both while avoiding depletion of the sheep. This approach aligns with the wisdom of making small adjustments based on current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while it is beneficial to maintain some hunting to support wolf reproduction, I want to ensure that we do not deplete the sheep too quickly. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a more cautious approach, balancing the needs of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. However, with the wolf population also being relatively high, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.22, which is only 24.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a moderate hunting intensity is appropriate to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to sustain itself. By maintaining a balance, I can ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.27, which is only 19.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our wolf population without depleting the sheep further, promoting a more balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.58, which is only 16.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.23, which is only 13.8% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of both populations. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.38, which is only 12.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.21, which is only 11.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support our wolf population without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.31, which is only 10.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the long-term balance of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.80, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.400 to 0.350, I can still focus on competition with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and gradually increase. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance."
