            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help support wolf reproduction while still maintaining a balance that prevents over-depletion of the sheep. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio, a slight increase in hunting will help ensure both populations can thrive without leading to a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 41.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to prevent a crash in the sheep population. A moderate increase in hunting intensity allows for a balance that supports both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while preventing over-depletion of the sheep. This balance helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.22, which is only 24.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, enabling us to sustain our wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.27, which is only 19.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.58, which is only 16.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while we need to be cautious about overhunting, a slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted to take advantage of the current sheep numbers without risking depletion. A gradual adjustment to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still giving sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.23, which is only 13.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.38, which is only 12.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it is crucial to avoid overexploitation to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.21, which is only 11.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should be cautious with our hunting to allow the sheep to recover. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.30, there is still some room for moderate hunting to ensure our wolf population remains healthy. A slight increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing our needs.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.31, which is only 10.3% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.80, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting without risking depletion. By increasing theta slightly from 0.35 to 0.40, I can intensify hunting just enough to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.42, which is only 9.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.30, which is only 9.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing theta from 0.35 to 0.40, I can maintain a balance between hunting and allowing the sheep population to stabilize, while also considering the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.26, which is only 9.3% of its maximum capacity.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.68, which is only 9.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for wolf survival while giving sheep a chance to increase their numbers. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.03, which is only 10% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.42, which is only 10.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to stabilize while still competing with other wolves. This moderate approach helps maintain a balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.91, which is only 10.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some reproduction among wolves while still giving sheep a chance to recover.
