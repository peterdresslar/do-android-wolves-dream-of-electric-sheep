            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 99.53, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. However, I must remain cautious as the wolf population is low, and I need to ensure that we do not over-deplete the sheep. A theta of 0.73 allows for sustainable hunting while still considering the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a sustainable balance. This adjustment will help support the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. With a high sheep-to-wolf ratio and a growing wolf population, a moderate approach will help maintain balance and prevent depletion of the sheep, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at maximum capacity, indicating that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing our own population. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and prevent over-depletion of the sheep, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
