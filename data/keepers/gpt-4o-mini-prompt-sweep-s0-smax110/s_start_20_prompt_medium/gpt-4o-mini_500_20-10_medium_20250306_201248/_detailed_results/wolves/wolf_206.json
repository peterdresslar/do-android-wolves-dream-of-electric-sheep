While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.38 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 29.68, which is only 27.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A moderate increase from my previous theta of 0.38 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still being mindful of the sheep population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.42, which is only 21.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is some room for hunting, I need to be cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a more balanced approach, focusing on maintaining the sheep population while still ensuring the wolf pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.91, which is only 17.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.400 to 0.35, I can maintain a focus on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.44, which is only 14.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should be cautious with our hunting to allow the sheep to recover. However, given that the wolf population is relatively high at 53, a slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted to maintain our own population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.31, which is only 13.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for sustenance with the long-term health of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.06, which is only 11.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
