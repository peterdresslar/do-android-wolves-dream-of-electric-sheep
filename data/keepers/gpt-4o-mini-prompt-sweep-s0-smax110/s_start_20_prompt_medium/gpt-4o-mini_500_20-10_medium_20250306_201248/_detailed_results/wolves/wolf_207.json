            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 90.7% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment maintains a balance between ensuring our wolf population can thrive while allowing the sheep to recover from previous hunting pressures.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that we should maintain a balanced approach to hunting. A moderate theta allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some hunting to support our wolf population. This adjustment helps prevent over-depletion of the sheep while also considering the growth of our own numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. A moderate theta value will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can stabilize, promoting long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. With a high sheep-to-wolf ratio and a growing wolf population, it is wise to focus on competition among wolves rather than depleting the sheep further. This approach will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
