A slight reduction from my previous theta will help maintain a balance as the wolf population is also significant. This adjustment will support sustainable coexistence while still allowing for reproduction.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 30.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of gradual changes and ensures a balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep.",

This suggests that while there is some room for hunting, I need to be cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, enabling sustainable coexistence while still considering the growth of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.55, which is only 18.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.20, which is only 15.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is potential for the sheep to recover if I adopt a more balanced approach. By increasing theta slightly to 0.40, I can still hunt effectively while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow, ensuring a sustainable ecosystem for both wolves and sheep.",
