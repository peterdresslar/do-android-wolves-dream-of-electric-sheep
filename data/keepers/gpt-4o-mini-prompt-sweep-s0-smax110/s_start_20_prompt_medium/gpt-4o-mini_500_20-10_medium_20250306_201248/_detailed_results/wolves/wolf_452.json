            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 84.45, which allows for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain our wolf population while ensuring that the sheep do not become too depleted. A gradual adjustment is necessary to maintain balance and avoid sudden crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without significantly depleting the sheep population, ensuring long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 48.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level relative to its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. A moderate hunting intensity will allow for some sheep recovery while still supporting the wolf population. This balance helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.34, which is only 28.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a lower hunting intensity is necessary to allow the sheep to recover. Additionally, with a wolf population of 70, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low at 0.45, indicating competition among wolves is significant. A theta of 0.35 allows for a focus on competition while still enabling some hunting, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.52, which is only 23.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is potential for the sheep population to recover if I reduce hunting intensity slightly. By increasing theta only modestly to 0.40, I can still maintain some hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing sheep numbers to stabilize and grow. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.37, which is only 18.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to allow for some reproduction among wolves while still giving sheep a chance to recover. A small increase from my previous theta of 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting sustainability without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.17, which is only 15.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should maintain a cautious approach to hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.450 will help balance the need for hunting with the necessity of ensuring the sheep population can grow, while also considering the current wolf population of 56. I aim for a sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.75, which is only 13.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking a rapid decline in the sheep population, promoting a more sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.37, which is only 12.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach while still being mindful of the need to avoid overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.17, which is only 11.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting a theta of 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This gradual adjustment helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.50, which is only 10.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased slightly to support wolf reproduction, it is crucial to avoid overhunting to allow the sheep population to recover. A gradual increase to 0.40 strikes a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.94, which is only 9.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting without depleting the sheep further, ensuring both populations can stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.76, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while being mindful of the need to avoid overhunting.",
