            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term health of both species. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance as the sheep population recovers and the wolf population stabilizes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain the balance between wolf and sheep populations while ensuring that we do not over-deplete the sheep. A gradual increase is prudent given the current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population also being relatively high, I want to avoid overhunting and ensure that both populations can thrive. A gradual increase to 0.45 allows for some hunting while maintaining balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 37.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 71, it is wise to maintain a moderate hunting intensity to allow both populations to stabilize. This theta value reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for sustenance with the importance of not depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.34, which is only 28.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while we can hunt, we need to be cautious to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 reflects a balanced approach, focusing more on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to support our population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.52, which is only 23.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach to hunting while still being cautious about the overall ecosystem health.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.37, which is only 18.5% of its maximum capacity.

This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.75, which is only 13.4% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity slightly while still allowing for some hunting to maintain wolf health. This moderate adjustment will help the sheep recover while preventing overcompetition among wolves.",

A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance while still considering the need for wolves to thrive.",

This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own wolf population. A slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted, but it should be gradual to avoid depleting the sheep further. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.65, which is only 9.7% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover.
