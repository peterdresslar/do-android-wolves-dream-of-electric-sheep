To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while also considering the competition among wolves. A gradual increase in theta will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",

To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to shift my focus towards competition with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to recover while maintaining a sustainable balance.",

Maintaining a lower theta allows the sheep to recover while keeping our wolf population stable. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and sustainable coexistence.",

Maintaining a lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, preventing overhunting and potential crashes in the ecosystem.",
