            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 48\n- Sheep population: 11.98\n- Wolf population: 37.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.350\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.32 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 10.9% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is close to its maximum capacity, and while I want to maintain a healthy wolf population, I also need to ensure that we can reproduce effectively. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for sustainable hunting while still taking advantage of the current sheep abundance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 90.8% of its maximum capacity, allowing for some increased hunting without risking a significant depletion. However, with the wolf population at 44, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 79.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with the wolf population at 53.00, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a balanced approach. With the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicating that there are enough sheep for hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly, a slight reduction from my previous theta will help maintain stability in both populations. This adjustment reflects the need to adapt to the current conditions while ensuring the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting approach. This will help maintain the balance between wolves and sheep, ensuring that both populations can thrive without depleting resources. A slight decrease from my previous theta reflects the need to adapt to the growing wolf population while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 41.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.67, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery. A gradual increase aligns with the wisdom of maintaining balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 25.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 67, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is low, suggesting that we need to be cautious about hunting intensity to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight decrease in theta allows for a more balanced approach, enabling sheep recovery while still maintaining a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.33, which is only 20.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own wolf population. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance and prevent over-depletion of the sheep, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.89, which is only 17.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that can help sustain both populations while being mindful of the current trends.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.19, which is only 14.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.400 to 0.35, I can maintain a focus on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring a balance that supports both populations in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.14, which is only 12.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.92, which is only 11.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 will help balance our needs without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.98, which is only 10.9% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and avoid depleting their numbers further, I will focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensifying hunting. This approach will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem while ensuring the long-term survival of both species."
