            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and I want to maintain a balance between hunting and allowing the sheep to recover. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help support the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly, considering the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the trends in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 51.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 66.00, it's important to avoid overhunting to prevent depletion of the sheep. A slight reduction from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring both populations can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, it is wise to avoid overhunting to maintain balance. A moderate theta allows for a gradual increase in hunting intensity while still considering the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 30.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 69, it is wise to maintain a cautious approach to hunting. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of sheep and ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.9% of its maximum capacity, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between our population and the sheep, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.55, which is only 18.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to allow the sheep to recover while also considering the growing wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack without depleting the sheep further, promoting a balance that can lead to long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I need to increase my hunting intensity to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.73, which is only 13.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I need to be cautious about hunting too aggressively, I can still afford to increase my hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction. A theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still enabling some hunting to help maintain the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.20, which is only 12.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to help sustain my pack without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting both wolf reproduction and sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.89, which is only 10.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.29, which is only 10.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some reproduction among wolves while still giving sheep a chance to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach, promoting coexistence without risking a rapid decline in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance while still being cautious about the wolf population growth.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.42, which is only 9.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is potential for recovery if I reduce hunting intensity slightly. By increasing theta to 0.40, I can maintain a balance that allows for some hunting while also giving the sheep a chance to recover, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.32, which is only 9.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover.

This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.37, which is only 9.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is an opportunity to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A small increase to 0.40 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for food with the sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.49, which is only 9.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.65, which is only 9.7% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will enable me to maintain a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.00, which is only 10% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population.
