            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 97.70, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction. However, I must remain cautious and avoid overhunting, as the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity. This adjustment allows for sustainable coexistence while still addressing the needs of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 48.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, it is wise to maintain a moderate hunting intensity to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly while still allowing for wolf reproduction. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 37.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 71, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.34, which is only 28.5% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, allowing both populations to stabilize without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.52, which is only 23.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still being mindful of the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.37, which is only 18.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our needs while prioritizing the long-term balance of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.17, which is only 15.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting without risking the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.75, which is only 13.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 to 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need to compete with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to support the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.37, which is only 12.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is an opportunity to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A gradual increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, acknowledging the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.17, which is only 11.1% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population, I will focus on a lower hunting intensity. This will help ensure the long-term survival of both species and prevent a crash in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.50, which is only 10.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased slightly, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate increase to 0.40 allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still considering the long-term health of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.94, which is only 9.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to ensure the wolf population remains stable. A slight decrease from my previous theta will help balance our needs with the ecosystem",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.76, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is a need to allow the sheep to recover while also ensuring that the wolf population remains stable.
