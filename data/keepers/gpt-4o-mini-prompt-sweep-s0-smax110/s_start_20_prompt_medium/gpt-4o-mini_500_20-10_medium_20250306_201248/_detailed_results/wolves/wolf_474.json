            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need for balance, a theta of 0.45 reflects a cautious yet proactive approach.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.34, which is only 28.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while also focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring a balance that supports both populations in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.52, which is only 23.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still being cautious about the sheep population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.37, which is only 18.5% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to help sustain wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.40 aligns with the wisdom of making small adjustments and considering the current state of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.17, which is only 15.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that the sheep are under pressure, and while I want to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep. A lower theta allows for competition among wolves while giving the sheep a chance to rebound. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.75, which is only 13.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.37, which is only 12.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing our need for sustenance with the necessity of ensuring the sheep can rebound.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.17, which is only 11.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is potential for recovery in the sheep population. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly to 0.40, I can still focus on maintaining a healthy wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of avoiding sudden changes and responding to the current state of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.50, which is only 10.5% of its maximum capacity.

This indicates a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves and ensure that the sheep population has the opportunity to grow, which is essential for the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.76, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should be cautious with our hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.300 to 0.35 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both populations.",

While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help me maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability without depleting the sheep further.",
