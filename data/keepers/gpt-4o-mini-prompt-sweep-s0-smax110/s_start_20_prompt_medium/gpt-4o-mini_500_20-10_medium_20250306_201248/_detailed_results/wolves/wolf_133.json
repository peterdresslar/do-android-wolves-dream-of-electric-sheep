            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 55.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.95, a moderate approach will allow for coexistence while also considering the growth of the wolf population. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring both can thrive without depleting resources too quickly. Gradually adjusting towards a more balanced approach will support long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.89, which is only 32.6% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.40 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the balance needed for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover gradually.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.57, which is only 19.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is some opportunity for hunting, it is essential to maintain a balance to allow the sheep population to recover. A moderate theta of 0.40 allows for some hunting while also focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.71, which is only 16.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus more on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This gradual adjustment helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.27, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.36, which is only 12.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need to compete with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to sustain our population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.19, which is only 11.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of the wolf pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.23, which is only 10.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to allow the sheep population to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.78, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This approach aligns with my objective of ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.63, which is only 9.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should prioritize allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a slight focus on hunting to support our wolf population. A small increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach that can help both populations stabilize without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.51, which is only 9.6% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable balance, I will focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensifying hunting. This approach will help stabilize both populations in the long term.",

This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a slight hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A small increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach that considers both the immediate needs of the wolf pack and the long-term sustainability of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.74, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be slightly increased to support wolf reproduction, it is essential to do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A gradual increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, ensuring both populations can recover sustainably.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.97, which is only 10.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting without depleting the sheep further, ensuring a sustainable balance as both populations adjust.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.29, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a need for caution in hunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a modest increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term survival of both species. This approach helps maintain a balance as the sheep population recovers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the wolf population is relatively high. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling wolves to compete effectively. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.19, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports our wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.73, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring sustainability while also allowing for some growth in the wolf pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.42, which is only 12.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight decrease in theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting to support the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.21, which is only 12.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of the wolf population."
