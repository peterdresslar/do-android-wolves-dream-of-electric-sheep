            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 258\n- Sheep population: 12.56\n- Wolf population: 40.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.400\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.31 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 11.4% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 106.20, which allows for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking over-depletion. This adjustment will help sustain our wolf population while still allowing sheep to recover gradually.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 98.01, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help support wolf reproduction while ensuring that the sheep population does not decline too rapidly. A gradual adjustment is necessary to maintain balance and avoid overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain our wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual approach will maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly, and this theta reflects a balanced approach to coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 50.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 67, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 42.81, which is only 38.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, promoting a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 33.32, which is only 30.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting without risking depletion. However, with the wolf population at 70, it is important to maintain a balance to avoid overhunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for sustainable hunting while still considering the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.06, which is only 23.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for more hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance that supports both wolf and sheep populations. This approach aligns with the wisdom of making gradual adjustments to adapt to the current ecosystem state.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.97, which is only 19.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing our need for sustenance with the long-term health of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.63, which is only 16.0% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the survival of both wolves and sheep, a slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted to take advantage of the current sheep population without depleting it too quickly. This adjustment allows for a more balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still supporting wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.36, which is only 14.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help balance our needs with the sustainability of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.71, which is only 12.5% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to help sustain the wolf population while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep too quickly. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.35 aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.56, which is only 11.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery of the sheep population. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need to compete with other wolves while still allowing sheep to replenish. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable ecosystem."
