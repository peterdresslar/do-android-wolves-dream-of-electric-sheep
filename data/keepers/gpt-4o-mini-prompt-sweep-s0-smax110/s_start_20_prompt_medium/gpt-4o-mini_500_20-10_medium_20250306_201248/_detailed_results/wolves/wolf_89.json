            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 114\n- Sheep population: 17.71\n- Wolf population: 59.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.350\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.30 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 16.1% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at its maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to prevent depletion. A theta of 0.6 allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while also giving the sheep a chance to recover and maintain their population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A balanced approach will help maintain both sheep and wolf populations sustainably, avoiding depletion of resources while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 4.07, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution in hunting to allow for recovery. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize our population while giving the sheep a chance to rebound, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that they can sustain a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. A moderate increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the long-term health of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 93.3% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing sheep to recover. A gradual increase aligns with the wisdom of maintaining balance and responding to current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, but I want to ensure that we do not overhunt and deplete their numbers too quickly. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a more cautious approach, focusing on maintaining a balance while still allowing for some hunting to support our wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction. However, I must remain cautious and avoid overhunting, as the sheep population is still below maximum capacity. A gradual increase will help maintain balance and ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 55.9% of its maximum capacity, which suggests there is still room for growth. Given that the wolf population is slightly higher than the sheep population, I want to focus on maintaining a balance that allows both populations to thrive. A theta of 0.40 reflects a cautious approach, allowing for some hunting while also considering the need for sheep recovery and avoiding overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level relative to its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A slight decrease in hunting will help ensure the long-term survival of both species while still allowing for some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.69, which is only 25.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for moderate hunting without risking depletion. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.400 to 0.450, I can help ensure the wolf population remains healthy while still allowing the sheep to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.57, which is only 19.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the long-term balance between wolf and sheep populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.71, which is only 16.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to be cautious with our hunting to allow the sheep to recover. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.30, there is still a need to maintain some hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A slight increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.27, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population without depleting the sheep further."
