            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 88.1% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term health of both populations. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance as the wolf population grows, ensuring sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term survival of both species. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance as the sheep population is recovering, while also considering the growth of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment reflects a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly, considering the current dynamics of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to prevent a crash in the sheep population. A slight reduction in hunting intensity allows for a balanced approach that supports both populations.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.27, which is only 23.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is some opportunity for hunting, it is important to maintain a balance to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.450 to 0.40 reflects a cautious approach, allowing for sustainable coexistence while still considering the need to support the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.55, which is only 18.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that I can afford to increase my hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A gradual increase to 0.45 reflects a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without risking a rapid decline in sheep numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.20, which is only 15.6% of its maximum capacity. While I want to ensure the wolves can thrive, I need to be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain a healthy balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.73, which is only 13.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for the sheep to recover, and a lower theta allows for a focus on competition among wolves while still enabling some hunting. This approach will help maintain a balance and prevent over-depletion of the sheep population, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.20, which is only 12.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.89, which is only 10.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from the previous theta of 0.40 to 0.35, I can still maintain some hunting activity while prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.29, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a balance as I monitor the trends in both populations, ensuring the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.66, which is only 9.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own population growth. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.42, which is only 9.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers."
