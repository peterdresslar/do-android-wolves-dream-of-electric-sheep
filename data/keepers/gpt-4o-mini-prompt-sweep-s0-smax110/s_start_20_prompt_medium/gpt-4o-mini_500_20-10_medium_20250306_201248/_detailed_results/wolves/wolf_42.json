            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still healthy at 99.86, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 44, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 79% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that can help sustain both the wolf and sheep populations. This value balances the need for hunting to support wolf reproduction while also considering the long-term health of the sheep population. It allows for gradual adjustments as conditions change.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction without risking a significant depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the sheep-to-wolf ratio being close to 1, it is important to maintain a sustainable coexistence. A slight reduction from my previous theta will help ensure that both populations can thrive without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 41.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 32.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a wolf population of 69, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is low, suggesting that we should focus on maintaining a balance rather than intensifying hunting. A slight decrease in theta allows for some hunting while prioritizing the recovery of sheep, ensuring long-term sustainability for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly. It reflects a cautious approach to ensure both species can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.33, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a significant competition among wolves. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing the competition with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.89, which is only 17.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting sustainability while still considering the need to compete with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.19, which is only 14.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for moderate hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.14, which is only 12.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, promoting a gradual balance that supports both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.92, which is only 11.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need to adapt to the changing conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.98, which is only 10.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus more on competing with other wolves to stabilize our population while allowing the sheep to gradually increase. This approach aligns with the wisdom of making small adjustments and maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.55, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover gradually."
