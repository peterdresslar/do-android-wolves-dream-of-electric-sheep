A slight increase in hunting intensity will allow for some reproduction among wolves while still giving sheep a chance to recover. This approach maintains a balance without risking a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover and ensures the long-term survival of both species. It is essential to focus on competition with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize.",

A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",

A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach helps maintain a balance between both species.",

To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain balance and prevent overhunting.",

This moderate adjustment allows for sustainable coexistence while still supporting the wolf population.",

A gradual increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the long-term health of the sheep population.",

This adjustment will help sustain our wolf population while still allowing sheep to recover if needed. A gradual increase aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 79% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate hunting approach. This will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations while avoiding overhunting. A slight decrease from my previous theta reflects the need to adapt to the growing wolf population and ensure sustainable coexistence.",

This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",

Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.89, a slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted, but I want to ensure that I do not push the sheep population down too rapidly, allowing for a gradual balance between hunting and competition with other wolves.",
