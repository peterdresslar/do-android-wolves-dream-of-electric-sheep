            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still healthy at 84.2% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover if needed. A gradual approach is essential to maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while preventing over-depletion of the sheep. This balance will help maintain sustainable cycles in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 57.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population being equal to the sheep population, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to prevent a crash in both populations. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on the competition with other wolves, ensuring long-term balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 45.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 68, which is relatively high, I need to focus on competition among wolves to prevent overhunting and allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 strikes a balance between hunting and competition, promoting sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 37.88, which is only 34.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 29.68, which is only 27.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 allows for a more balanced approach to hunting while still being cautious about the wolf population growth.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.42, which is only 21.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of avoiding sudden changes and promoting long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.91, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a balance as the wolf population is relatively high, and I want to ensure we do not overhunt while still allowing for some growth in our numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.44, which is only 14.9% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. This slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 reflects a cautious approach to balance competition with other wolves and the need for sustainable hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.31, which is only 13.0% of its maximum capacity. Increasing my hunting intensity slightly to 0.40 allows for a modest increase in sheep hunting while still considering the need for sustainability. This adjustment helps ensure that the wolf population can thrive without depleting the sheep too quickly, maintaining a balance that supports both species in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.06, which is only 11.9% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.93, which is only 10.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.34, which is only 10.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.4 to 0.35, I can maintain a focus on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, promoting a balance that supports both populations in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.02, which is only 10% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without risking the sheep"
