            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A theta of 0.45 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for some hunting while also considering the need to sustain the sheep population and avoid overexploitation. This will help maintain a healthy ecosystem for both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. A moderate theta value will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can stabilize, promoting long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 4.07, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 3.67, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain our numbers without depleting the sheep too quickly. This approach allows for a gradual balance, ensuring both populations can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations while ensuring our pack can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 84.2% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 48, it is wise to avoid over-hunting to ensure sustainability and prevent depletion of the sheep. A gradual increase to 0.45 allows for a balanced approach that supports both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population while still ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A moderate approach balances our needs with the ecosystem",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 57.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population being equal to the sheep population, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring that both populations can thrive without leading to a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 45.2% of its maximum capacity, which indicates that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 68, it is wise to maintain a cautious approach to avoid over-depleting the sheep. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced strategy that promotes coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring both populations can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 29.68, which is only 27.0% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, allowing both populations to stabilize without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.42, which is only 21.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for more hunting intensity while still being cautious about the wolf population growth. This approach supports both the immediate needs of the pack and the long-term health of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.91, which is only 17.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for the sheep to recover without depleting their numbers further. By adopting a lower theta, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize while ensuring our pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.44, which is only 14.9% of its maximum capacity. While I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. A slight increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting."
