            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and while I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A moderate approach will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while also reducing competition among wolves. This approach supports the long-term survival of both populations and maintains a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is close to its maximum capacity, indicating that we should be cautious with our hunting to avoid depleting their numbers too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting sustainable coexistence while still enabling some hunting to support our wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 91.1% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This moderate adjustment will help ensure the wolf population remains healthy without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 88.48, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to maintain balance, considering the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need to avoid overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. It reflects a balanced approach, considering both the current state and the trends in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still ensuring that the sheep population can recover and thrive. By maintaining a balance, I can avoid depleting the sheep too quickly and ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 41.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 31.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 70, which is relatively high, I need to be cautious about overhunting. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain their population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population while still allowing sheep to recover. A moderate increase helps maintain balance as we adapt to the current ecosystem state.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.27, which is only 19.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a more sustainable approach, balancing the need for wolf reproduction with the recovery of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.58, which is only 16.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, reducing hunting intensity while still competing effectively with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.23, which is only 13.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting without risking depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach that supports wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery.",
