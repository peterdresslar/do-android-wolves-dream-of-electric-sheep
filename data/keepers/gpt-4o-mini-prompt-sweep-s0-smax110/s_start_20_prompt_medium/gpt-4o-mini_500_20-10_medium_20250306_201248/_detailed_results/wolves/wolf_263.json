            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 249\n- Sheep population: 71.57\n- Wolf population: 61.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.080\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 1.17 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 65.1% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.17, it is essential to focus on competition among wolves to prevent overhunting and allow the sheep population to recover. A gradual increase in theta will help maintain balance without depleting resources too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 50.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. A moderate increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 42.81, which is only 38.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while being mindful of the need to avoid sudden changes.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.06, which is only 23.7% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and avoid depleting their numbers further, I will focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intense hunting. This moderate approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species while allowing for a gradual recovery of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.97, which is only 19.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain our wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will enable me to maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.63, which is only 16.0% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing competition with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.36, which is only 14.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.71, which is only 12.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting while prioritizing the long-term balance between our populations.",

To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity and give the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we are competing for limited resources. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help sustain our population without depleting the sheep too quickly. This gradual adjustment allows for a balanced approach, ensuring both species can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.30, which is only 10.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.99, which is only 10.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should prioritize the recovery of the sheep population while still allowing for some hunting to sustain our wolf pack. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, ensuring that we do not over-deplete the sheep while still competing effectively with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.85, which is only 9.9% of its maximum capacity. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.45, it is crucial to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can prioritize competition with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.01, which is only 10% of its maximum capacity.

A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while being mindful of the need to avoid sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.20, which is only 10.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase to 0.40 allows for some hunting while still considering the long-term sustainability of both populations.",

While I need to maintain a healthy wolf population, I also want to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for some hunting to support reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.73, which is only 10.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while still competing with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we are nearing a critical point. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain its health. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments to ensure long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.73, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity can be increased slightly without risking depletion. However, I must remain cautious and avoid drastic changes, as the wolf population is also a factor. A small increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach that supports both hunting and the recovery of sheep."
