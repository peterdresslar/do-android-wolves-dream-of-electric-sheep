Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery. Maintaining a balance is crucial to ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, especially as the wolf population is relatively stable.

A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that considers both the current sheep population and the need for sustainable coexistence.",
