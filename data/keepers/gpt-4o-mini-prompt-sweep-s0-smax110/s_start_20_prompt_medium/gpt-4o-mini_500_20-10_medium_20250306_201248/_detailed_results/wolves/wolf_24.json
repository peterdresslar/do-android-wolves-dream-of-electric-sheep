A theta of 0.65 allows for a balanced approach, ensuring we can sustain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover and thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that we should reduce hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta will help maintain a balance between our needs and the sustainability of the ecosystem, while also considering the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that we should be cautious with our hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate approach will help maintain balance while still allowing for some hunting to support our wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep to replenish while maintaining a sustainable wolf population. This gradual adjustment will help ensure long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A small increase to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach that considers both the current high sheep population and the need to maintain a sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help sustain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover.",

However, with the wolf population at 44, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure sustainable coexistence. A gradual increase to 0.45 allows for some reproduction while still considering the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 79.0% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate hunting approach. This will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations while avoiding overhunting. Gradually reducing hunting intensity as the wolf population grows will also support long-term sustainability.",

A slight decrease in hunting will help maintain a balance while still allowing for some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term survival of both species. This adjustment reflects a balanced approach, as the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we can afford to hunt a bit more without risking depletion.",

This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. By lowering theta to 0.35, I can focus more on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring a balance that promotes long-term sustainability for both populations.",

This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting sustainability without risking a rapid depletion of the sheep.",
