            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 316\n- Sheep population: 109.69\n- Wolf population: 33.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.452\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 3.32 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 99.7% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is very close to its maximum capacity, indicating that we should be cautious with our hunting to avoid depleting their numbers too quickly. A moderate theta allows us to maintain a balance, ensuring the sheep can recover while also allowing for some hunting to support our wolf population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring both can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 88.1% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity. This value will help maintain a balance between hunting and allowing the sheep to recover, while also considering the growing wolf population. A gradual approach is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without overly depleting the sheep population, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still recovering and is currently at 64.9% of its maximum capacity. A moderate hunting intensity allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling wolves to thrive. This adjustment is small enough to avoid sudden impacts on the sheep population, ensuring both species can maintain their balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover gradually.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term survival of both species. This adjustment reflects a balanced approach, considering the need to sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover and thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.27, which is only 23.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I need to maintain some hunting to support wolf reproduction, I should also be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a more balanced approach, ensuring the sheep can recover while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.55, which is only 18.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is a need to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining some hunting to support our wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking a drastic decline in the sheep population, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.20, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking over-depletion. This adjustment will help support the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover gradually.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.73, which is only 13.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.4 to 0.35, I can still maintain some hunting intensity while prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both populations. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.20, which is only 12.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both populations."
