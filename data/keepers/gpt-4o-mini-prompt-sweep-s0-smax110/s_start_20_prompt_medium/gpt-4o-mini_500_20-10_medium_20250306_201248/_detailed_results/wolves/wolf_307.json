            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a sustainable balance. This approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, as it allows for some reproduction among wolves without depleting the sheep population too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and maintaining a moderate hunting intensity allows for sustainable coexistence. This approach balances the needs of both wolves and sheep while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep. This moderate adjustment will help maintain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must also consider the potential for overhunting. A slight reduction from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that supports both populations without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual increase aligns with the current trends and avoids sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.27, which is only 23.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.55, which is only 18.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is an opportunity to increase hunting intensity, it is crucial to avoid overexploitation. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population, ensuring a sustainable balance between both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.20, which is only 15.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.73, which is only 13.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is potential for recovery in the sheep population. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity to 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep to recover, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.20, which is only 12.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance while still considering the need for wolf population sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.29, which is only 10.3% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still being cautious. A gradual increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, enabling us to sustain our wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly."
