            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking a rapid depletion of their numbers. This adjustment will help sustain our wolf population while still considering the long-term health of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 90.8% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help sustain our wolf population while still being mindful of the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 79.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.64, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while I want to maintain my hunting efforts to support wolf reproduction, I also need to ensure that the sheep population can recover. A slight reduction in hunting intensity allows for a balanced approach, fostering coexistence while still addressing the needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, and while it is beneficial to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A theta of 0.45 allows for a balanced approach that supports both wolf and sheep populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 41.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, which is relatively high, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring that both populations can thrive without leading to depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term survival of both species. This adjustment reflects a balance between the need to support wolf reproduction and the necessity of not depleting the sheep population too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 25.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is potential for recovery. With a wolf population of 67, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is low, suggesting that we should focus on reducing competition among wolves to allow for a sustainable balance. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.33, which is only 20.3% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A gradual increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.89, which is only 17.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring a balance that promotes long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.19, which is only 14.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.14, which is only 12.9% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for some hunting without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.92, which is only 11.7% of its maximum capacity.

This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support our wolf population without risking a significant depletion of the sheep, promoting a more sustainable balance."
