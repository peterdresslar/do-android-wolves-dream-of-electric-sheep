            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we are nearing a critical point for sustainable hunting. A moderate theta allows for some hunting to support our population while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 29.68, which is only 27.0% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on a balanced approach that allows the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A slight decrease from my previous theta will help prevent overhunting and promote sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.42, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking their long-term survival. This adjustment aims to balance the needs of the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual increase will help maintain sustainable cycles.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.91, which is only 17.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing our own population. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity and give the sheep a chance to increase, while still allowing for some hunting to sustain our wolf pack.",

To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing competition among wolves, which is necessary given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio.",

To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting intensively. This approach will help balance the populations over time.",

A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and prevent overexploitation of the sheep, while still allowing for some hunting to support our reproduction."
