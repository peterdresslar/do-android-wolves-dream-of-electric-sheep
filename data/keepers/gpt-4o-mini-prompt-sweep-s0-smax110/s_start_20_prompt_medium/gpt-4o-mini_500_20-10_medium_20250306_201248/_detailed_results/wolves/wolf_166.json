            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 187\n- Sheep population: 13.06\n- Wolf population: 43.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.350\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.30 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 11.9% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that they are thriving. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 3.67, there is still a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will allow for some reproduction among wolves while still enabling the sheep population to recover in the long term. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that we can afford to hunt a bit more to support our wolf population without risking a significant depletion of sheep. However, I want to avoid a drastic increase in hunting intensity to maintain balance and allow for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 93.9% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can sustain their numbers. This approach balances our immediate needs with the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is key to maintaining balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 72.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with the wolf population at 56.00, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 57.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population also at 64, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both populations can thrive. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that supports coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 45.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the need to maintain the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level relative to its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both sheep and wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 29.68, which is only 27.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I need to maintain some hunting to support wolf reproduction, I should also be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.42, which is only 21.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should be cautious with our hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.450 to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for some hunting while still prioritizing the sustainability of both populations. This adjustment also considers the growing wolf population, which requires a careful balance to avoid over-depletion of our prey.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.91, which is only 17.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.400 to 0.350, I can still maintain some hunting activity while prioritizing the sustainability of both populations. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively low at 16.44, which is only 14.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the immediate needs of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.31, which is only 13.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support reproduction, but it is still low enough to avoid depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.06, which is only 11.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain our wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of our pack."
