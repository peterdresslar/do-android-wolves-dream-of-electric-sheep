            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 183\n- Sheep population: 23.42\n- Wolf population: 64.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.400\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.37 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 21.3% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively small. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition with other wolves. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. With a current sheep-to-wolf ratio of 15.71, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery. Maintaining a lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, preventing overhunting and promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery. Maintaining a lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, as it prevents overhunting and allows the sheep population to stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance while still considering the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover and maintain a sustainable balance. This lower theta will help prevent over-depletion of the sheep while still allowing for some competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at its maximum capacity, and maintaining a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover and prevent overexploitation. This approach also helps to stabilize the wolf population as we focus on competition with other wolves, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",

With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 6.47, it is crucial to avoid overhunting to ensure the long-term survival of both species. Maintaining a lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent potential crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover and ensures the long-term survival of both species. Additionally, with the wolf population at 19, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to depletion of their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",

Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term survival for both.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 93.9% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover if needed. A gradual adjustment is key to maintaining balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 84.2% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep. This moderate adjustment will help maintain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This will help support wolf reproduction while still ensuring that the sheep population can recover and maintain balance. A gradual adjustment is key to avoiding sudden population crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 57.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population being equal to the sheep population, a more moderate approach is necessary to avoid over-depletion of sheep while still allowing for some hunting to support wolf reproduction. This slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a cautious balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. This will help sustain both the sheep and wolf populations while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep. A slight increase from my previous theta reflects the need to adapt to the current conditions without making drastic changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level relative to its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a need for caution in hunting. A moderate approach allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while also giving sheep a chance to recover. This balance is crucial for the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A slight decrease from my previous theta will help balance the competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to increase their numbers, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.42, which is only 21.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to allow for wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while considering the trends in both populations."
