By lowering the hunting intensity slightly, I can allow the sheep to recover while still competing with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",

While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase in hunting intensity to 0.40 will help maintain a balance, encouraging reproduction among wolves while still allowing for sheep recovery.",
