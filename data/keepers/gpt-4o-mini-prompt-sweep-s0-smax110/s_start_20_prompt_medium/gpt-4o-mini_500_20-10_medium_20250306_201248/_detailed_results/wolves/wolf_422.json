            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that we need to moderate our hunting to prevent depleting their numbers too quickly. A theta of 0.6 allows for a balanced approach, ensuring that we can still hunt effectively while also giving the sheep a chance to recover and maintain a sustainable population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A theta of 0.45 strikes a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring that both populations can thrive without depleting resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. A lower theta will help balance the competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to stabilize, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to depletion of their numbers. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep to recover while ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover while also keeping the wolf population stable. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery. Maintaining a lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, as it prevents overhunting and allows the sheep population to stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that we should be cautious with our hunting intensity to avoid depleting their numbers too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support our population while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations while ensuring our pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 97.70, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help sustain our wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover if needed. A gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual increase aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.09, it is wise to maintain a moderate hunting intensity to ensure both populations can thrive without depleting the sheep too quickly. This adjustment aligns with the need for gradual changes and supports long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 48.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, which is relatively high, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A moderate adjustment to 0.45 allows for some hunting while still focusing on maintaining balance and preventing depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level (37.2% of maximum capacity), and with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.58, it indicates that the sheep are somewhat vulnerable. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, enabling the sheep to recover while still allowing for some hunting to sustain the wolf population. This gradual adjustment helps avoid overexploitation of the sheep and supports long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.34, which is only 28.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, reducing hunting intensity while still ensuring the wolves can sustain themselves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.52, which is only 23.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, ensuring that we do not deplete the sheep too quickly while still competing effectively with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.37, which is only 18.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I need to be cautious about hunting too intensely, I can afford a slight increase in hunting intensity to help sustain my pack without depleting the sheep population too quickly. A moderate adjustment allows for a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.17, which is only 15.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting sustainability without risking a crash in the sheep population."
