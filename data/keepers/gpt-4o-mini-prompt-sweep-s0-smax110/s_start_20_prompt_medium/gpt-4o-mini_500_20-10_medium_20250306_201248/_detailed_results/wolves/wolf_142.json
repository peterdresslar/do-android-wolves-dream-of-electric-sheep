To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover and prevent overexploitation. A gradual increase in theta will help maintain balance as conditions change.",

This approach helps maintain a balance in the ecosystem and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at its maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid depletion of their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for a focus on competition with other wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 15.71, it is crucial to avoid overhunting to ensure the long-term survival of both species. Maintaining a steady approach will help balance the ecosystem.",
