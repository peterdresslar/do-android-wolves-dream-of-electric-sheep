            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that they can sustain some hunting pressure without immediate risk of depletion. However, I must be cautious and avoid overhunting, as the wolf population is relatively stable. A moderate increase in hunting intensity allows for reproduction while still considering the long-term balance of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to prevent depletion. A theta of 0.60 allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while also giving sheep a chance to recover and maintain their population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A theta of 0.45 strikes a balance between competing with other wolves and maintaining a sustainable sheep population, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. A moderate theta value will help balance the needs of both wolves and sheep, ensuring long-term sustainability while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and a slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain the balance without depleting the sheep too quickly. This adjustment allows for a sustainable coexistence while also considering the current wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a sustainable balance. This moderate adjustment helps ensure the wolf population can thrive without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports both wolf reproduction and sheep recovery. This approach helps maintain a sustainable balance while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 64.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still a healthy number of sheep available. However, with the wolf population at 61.00, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is slightly high at 1.17. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I will slightly reduce my hunting intensity to allow for a more sustainable balance, while still maintaining enough hunting to support the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.65, it is essential to maintain a balanced approach to ensure the long-term survival of both species. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery. It reflects a balanced approach to ensure both populations can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.9% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are not enough sheep to sustain aggressive hunting. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while also giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.55, which is only 18.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.20, which is only 15.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population and maintaining a balance with the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.73, which is only 13.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still recognizing the need to adapt to the current conditions."
