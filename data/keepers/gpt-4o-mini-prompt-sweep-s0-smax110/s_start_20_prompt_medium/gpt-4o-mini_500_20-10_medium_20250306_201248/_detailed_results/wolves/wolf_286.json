            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A lower theta will help balance the competition among wolves while ensuring the sheep can stabilize, preventing a potential crash in their population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. A moderate approach will help maintain balance while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to depletion of their numbers. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can help ensure a recovery of the sheep population while maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at maximum capacity, and maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows for the sheep to recover and prevents overexploitation. This approach also helps to stabilize the wolf population as we face competition from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery and prevent depletion. Maintaining a lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep while allowing for gradual adjustments in the future.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 4.07, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance while still considering the competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that can sustain both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual increase in theta aligns with the current trends and ensures a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 88.1% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 46, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure sustainability. A gradual increase to 0.45 reflects a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 84.56, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep. This moderate adjustment reflects the need to ensure sustainable coexistence as the sheep population is below maximum capacity, while also being cautious of the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment helps maintain our wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual increase aligns with the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and avoids sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 51.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.86, it is important to maintain a balance that allows both populations to thrive. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help the sheep recover while still allowing for some hunting to support the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still ensuring that the sheep population can recover and maintain balance. A gradual increase is prudent to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.9% of its maximum capacity, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help sustain our wolf population while still considering the long-term health of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.55, which is only 18.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to allow for recovery. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while also focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring a balance that promotes long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.20, which is only 15.6% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A moderate increase to 0.40 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for food with the long-term health of both species."
