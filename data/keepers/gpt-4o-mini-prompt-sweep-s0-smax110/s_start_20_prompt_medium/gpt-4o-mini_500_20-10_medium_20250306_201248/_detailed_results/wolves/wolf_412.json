Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover while keeping competition among wolves in check.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at maximum capacity, and hunting more aggressively could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",

This moderate adjustment helps maintain a balance without risking a rapid depletion of the sheep population.",

This suggests that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support our wolf population without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",
