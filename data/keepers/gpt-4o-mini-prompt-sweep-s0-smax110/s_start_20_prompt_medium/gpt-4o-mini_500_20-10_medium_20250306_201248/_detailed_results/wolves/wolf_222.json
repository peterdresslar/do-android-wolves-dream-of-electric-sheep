            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. A lower theta allows for competition among wolves while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This approach helps maintain a balance in the ecosystem, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 5.00, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery. Maintaining a lower theta will help prevent overexploitation of the sheep while allowing the wolf population to stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery. Maintaining a lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, as it allows the sheep population to stabilize and grow, while also preventing overcompetition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and a slight increase in hunting intensity will help manage their numbers while still allowing for recovery. This moderate adjustment balances the need for wolf reproduction with the sustainability of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is close to its maximum capacity, indicating a need for cautious hunting to prevent depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the sustainability of the sheep population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 98.01, allowing for a moderate hunting approach. This will help maintain a balance between our wolf population and the sheep, ensuring sustainable coexistence while avoiding overhunting that could lead to a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 86.52, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly. It",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, but I need to be cautious as the wolf population is also growing. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling us to maintain our numbers. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and promotes a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we need to focus on maintaining a sustainable balance. By slightly reducing hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while still competing with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments to ensure long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 33.32, which is only 30.3% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A gradual adjustment helps maintain balance and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.06, which is only 23.7% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach, ensuring both populations can thrive.",

While I need to ensure the wolves can reproduce, I must also allow the sheep to recover.
