            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 93.3% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight reduction in hunting intensity while still ensuring enough food for the wolf population. This adjustment will help maintain a balance as the wolf population grows, preventing overhunting and allowing for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still healthy at 91, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help support wolf reproduction while ensuring that the sheep population does not decline too rapidly. A gradual adjustment is necessary to maintain balance and avoid overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is necessary to maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain our wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual approach is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 43.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population also being relatively high, I need to ensure that we do not overhunt and deplete the sheep too quickly. A theta of 0.45 strikes a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting coexistence while still allowing for some growth in our numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.69, which is only 25.2% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.57, which is only 19.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach, promoting sustainability without risking a rapid depletion of sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.71, which is only 16.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to allow for recovery. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both sheep and wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.27, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will enable me to hunt more effectively while still prioritizing the sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.36, which is only 12.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for hunting with the necessity of ensuring the sheep population can grow, while also considering the current wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.19, which is only 11.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the immediate needs of the wolf pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.23, which is only 10.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a slight increase in hunting compared to my previous value, acknowledging the need to balance competition with other wolves while still prioritizing the sustainability of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.78, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable balance, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting sheep. This will help maintain the sheep population while also allowing for gradual adjustments in the wolf population."
