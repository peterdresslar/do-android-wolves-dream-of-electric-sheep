This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",

This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover.

This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.400 to 0.450, I can help ensure the wolf population remains healthy while still allowing the sheep to recover over time.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.39, which is only 12.2% of its maximum capacity. While I want to ensure my pack thrives, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, allowing both populations to stabilize without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.21, which is only 12.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I can increase my hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate increase to 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for wolves to thrive."
