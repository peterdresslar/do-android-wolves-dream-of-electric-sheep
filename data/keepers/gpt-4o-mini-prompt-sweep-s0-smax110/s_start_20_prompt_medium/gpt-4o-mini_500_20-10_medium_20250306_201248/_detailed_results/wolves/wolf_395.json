            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 391\n- Sheep population: 74.75\n- Wolf population: 59.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.993\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 1.27 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 68.0% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, I must be cautious not to overhunt, as the wolf population is also significant. This adjustment will help maintain a balance while ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 53.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 66.00, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure our long-term survival. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 41.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to prevent depletion of the sheep. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach that supports both the sheep and the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 31.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 70, which is relatively high, I need to balance hunting intensity to prevent over-depletion of sheep while ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. A moderate theta allows for a gradual increase in hunting without risking a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance while still allowing for some hunting to support the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.27, which is only 19.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for the sheep to recover. By lowering my hunting intensity slightly, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",

This indicates that there is potential for recovery in the sheep population. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep to gradually recover, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
