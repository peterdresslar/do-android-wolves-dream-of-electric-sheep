            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 463\n- Sheep population: 68.45\n- Wolf population: 63.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.134\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 1.09 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 62.2% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

A gradual increase in theta will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term survival of both species. This adjustment helps to balance the needs of the wolf population without over-depleting the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still being mindful of the wolf population. This adjustment helps maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep can recover, promoting long-term coexistence.",

To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing competition among wolves, which will help balance the ecosystem without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.52, which is only 23.2% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.35 reflects a balanced approach to ensure both species can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.37, which is only 18.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from the previous theta of 0.40 to 0.35, I can still maintain a balance that allows for some hunting while prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.17, which is only 15.6% of its maximum capacity.

A gradual increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, acknowledging the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.75, which is only 13.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing more on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",

A slight increase to 0.40 allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.94, which is only 9.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while maintaining a stable wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting without over-depleting the sheep, ensuring a sustainable balance.",

A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach that supports both species without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.59, which is only 9.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to stabilize while still competing with other wolves. This moderate approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",

This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable, and focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep population to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.48, which is only 10.4% of its maximum capacity.
