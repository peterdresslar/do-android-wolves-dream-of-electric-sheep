            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 98.01, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This value reflects a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while ensuring that the sheep population does not deplete too quickly. It also considers the current wolf population and the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy, and while I want to ensure my pack thrives, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, preventing over-exploitation while still allowing for some hunting to support our population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment reflects the need to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly. A moderate increase from my previous theta allows for gradual adaptation to the current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 50.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep. However, with the wolf population at 67, which is relatively high, I need to focus on maintaining balance. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to thrive without over-depleting the sheep resource.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population being relatively high, I must be cautious not to overhunt and risk depleting the sheep too quickly. A gradual increase will help maintain balance and ensure both populations can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 30.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.48, I need to focus on maintaining a balance that allows both populations to thrive. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help the sheep recover while still allowing for some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.06, which is only 23.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.97, which is only 19.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to allow the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack without depleting the sheep further, promoting a more balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.63, which is only 16.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach that supports wolf reproduction while still giving sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.36, which is only 14.0% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 will help me balance hunting with competition among wolves, promoting sustainability without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.71, which is only 12.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting without risking the depletion of the sheep. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.56, which is only 11.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.82, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking their long-term survival. This adjustment helps maintain a balance as the wolf population is relatively high, and a moderate increase in hunting can support our reproduction while still allowing sheep to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.30, which is only 10.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, ensuring both species can thrive in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.99, which is only 10.0% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking the depletion of the sheep population. A gradual increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, enabling us to maintain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover."
