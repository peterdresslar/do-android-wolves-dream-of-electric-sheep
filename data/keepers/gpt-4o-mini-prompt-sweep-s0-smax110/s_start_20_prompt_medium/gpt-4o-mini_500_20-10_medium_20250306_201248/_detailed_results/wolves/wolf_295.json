            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. A gradual increase from my previous theta will help maintain balance without causing sudden fluctuations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. This will help maintain a balance between the wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term survival for both. A gradual approach will prevent overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that a slight increase in hunting intensity is appropriate to maintain balance. However, given the current wolf population, I want to avoid overhunting and allow for some recovery of the sheep. A gradual increase to 0.35 reflects a cautious approach to ensure sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover and thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 88.1% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support the wolf population without risking a rapid depletion of sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 76.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep. However, with the wolf population at 54, which is relatively high, I need to focus on maintaining balance. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow sheep to recover while preventing overcompetition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 51.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.86, it is important to maintain a balanced approach to ensure both populations can thrive. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow sheep to recover while still enabling wolves to sustain their population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to prevent a crash in the sheep population. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing balance and coexistence.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.27, which is only 23.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for more hunting to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious to avoid overexploitation. This balance will help maintain both populations in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.55, which is only 18.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is some room for hunting, I need to be cautious and avoid overexploitation. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, focusing on sustainable coexistence while still considering the need to hunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.20, which is only 15.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.73, which is only 13.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some recovery of the sheep while still ensuring that the wolf population remains healthy. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach, promoting coexistence without risking a rapid depletion of the sheep.",
