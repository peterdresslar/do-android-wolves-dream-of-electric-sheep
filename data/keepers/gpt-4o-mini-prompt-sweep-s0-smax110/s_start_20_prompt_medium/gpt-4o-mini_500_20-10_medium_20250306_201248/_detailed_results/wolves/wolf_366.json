            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 400\n- Sheep population: 12.21\n- Wolf population: 41.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.400\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.30 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 11.1% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, which suggests that a slight reduction in hunting intensity is prudent to allow for recovery. This moderate approach helps maintain a balance between the wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term sustainability while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and while I want to ensure the wolves can reproduce, I also need to maintain a balance to prevent over-depletion of the sheep. A slight reduction from my previous theta allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 91.1% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 88.48, allowing for a moderate hunting approach. This will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations while avoiding overhunting. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.70, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still considering the long-term balance of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 53.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still a reasonable number of sheep available for hunting. However, with the wolf population at 66, which is relatively high, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still providing enough sustenance for the wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 41.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both populations can thrive. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that promotes coexistence while still recognizing the need for hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term survival of both species. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to ensure that the sheep can recover while we maintain a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.22, which is only 24.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting sustainable coexistence while still being mindful of the wolf population growth.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.27, which is only 19.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By adopting a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.58, which is only 16.0% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, a slight increase in hunting intensity will help us take advantage of the current sheep availability without depleting their numbers too quickly. This moderate adjustment allows for a sustainable balance as we adapt to the changing conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.23, which is only 13.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can stabilize, promoting long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.38, which is only 12.2% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will enable me to hunt more effectively while still prioritizing sustainability and avoiding over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.21, which is only 11.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.400 to 0.35, I can maintain a balance that focuses on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring the long-term survival of both species."
