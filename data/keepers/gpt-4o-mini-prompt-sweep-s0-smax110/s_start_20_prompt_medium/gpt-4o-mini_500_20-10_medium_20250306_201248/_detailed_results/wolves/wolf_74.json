This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover if needed. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 91, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are enough sheep to sustain our pack without overhunting. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a more cautious approach, ensuring that we do not deplete the sheep population too quickly while still allowing for some hunting to support our reproduction.",
