            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and the number of wolves has increased. Hunting at a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a moderate intensity will help me conserve energy while still being competitive in the hunt. This balance increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy and avoid competition while still allowing for opportunistic hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough prey without overexerting myself. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with an increase in the wolf population, competition for food will be fierce. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt when necessary. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and increases my chances of survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, indicating that hunting at maximum intensity may not be necessary. With the increase in the wolf population, a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive in the hunt. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less viable. With more wolves around, competition for food is high, so a lower intensity will help conserve energy while still allowing for some hunting. This way, I can adapt to the current situation and ensure my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, which means hunting intensity should be moderated to ensure sustainability. By increasing my intensity slightly to 0.50, I can still contribute to the hunt without overexploiting the remaining sheep, ensuring my survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with 48 wolves competing for food, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to overexertion and wasted energy. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's efforts, ensuring my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still being cautious, as overexerting myself could lead to unnecessary risks with other wolves competing for the same resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competing too aggressively with other wolves, who are also struggling. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity while still having a chance to catch prey.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can catch enough food without depleting the sheep too quickly. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's survival, especially given the recent decrease in both sheep and wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, and the number of wolves is also declining. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to survive longer while waiting for a more favorable situation.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while also conserving energy and avoiding overexertion.
