            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential failure. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still increasing my chances of a successful hunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts. This balance increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making it less likely to find prey. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making them a scarcer resource. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential failure. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, adapting to the current situation.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making it less likely to find enough food if I hunt at maximum intensity. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and increase my chances of survival in a challenging environment with more wolves competing for fewer sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, which means food is scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to hunt effectively while conserving energy for future hunts, as the competition with other wolves remains high.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and reduce the risk of overexertion while still contributing to the pack's survival. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the declining wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still conserving energy and avoiding overexertion. This approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity while still being competitive with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is high.

This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can secure enough food while also conserving energy. With the recent decrease in both sheep and wolf populations, a moderate intensity allows me to adapt to the changing environment and avoid overexertion, which could jeopardize my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, and with fewer sheep, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to wasted energy and increased competition with other wolves. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's needs, ensuring my survival in a challenging environment.",
