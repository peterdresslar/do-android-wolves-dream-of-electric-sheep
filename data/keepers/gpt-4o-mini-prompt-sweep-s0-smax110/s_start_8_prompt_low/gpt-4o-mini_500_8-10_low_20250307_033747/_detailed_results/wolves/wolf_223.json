With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and reduce competition for the remaining prey. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population increasing and the number of wolves remaining the same, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to balance my need for food while minimizing competition with other wolves. This way, I can still secure enough resources without overexerting myself, which is crucial for my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and with 16 wolves competing for food, a moderate hunting intensity will allow me to secure enough resources while conserving energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because with the number of sheep increasing and the wolf population stable, a slightly reduced hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive. This way, I can adapt to the changing environment and ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means hunting might become more competitive. By increasing my intensity to 0.75, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival as the competition among wolves remains constant.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 16 wolves competing for food, a slightly reduced hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This balance increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity. By reducing my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a stable environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a more cautious approach. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if necessary.",
            "I chose this theta because with a stable population of wolves and a slight increase in sheep, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough prey without overexerting myself. A theta of 0.50 allows me to be more strategic and conserve energy while still being effective in hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because with the current number of sheep being relatively high compared to the stable wolf population, a lower hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still taking advantage of the available resources. This approach also reduces competition with other wolves, as they will likely hunt at maximum intensity, potentially leading to overexploitation of the sheep. By being strategic, I can ensure my survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because with the current number of sheep and wolves, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to balance between ensuring enough food for survival while not overexerting myself. This way, I can adapt to the competition from other wolves and the available prey.",
            "I chose this theta because with a stable number of wolves and an increase in sheep, I need to balance the risk of overexerting myself while still being competitive in the hunt. A theta of 0.70 allows me to increase my hunting intensity without fully committing to maximum effort, which could lead to exhaustion or injury if the hunt doesn",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased slightly, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment."
