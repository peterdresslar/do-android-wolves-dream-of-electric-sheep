            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively when necessary.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can balance the need to secure enough food while conserving energy and avoiding overexertion in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves, which means there is enough food available. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can take advantage of the current situation without overexerting myself, ensuring I remain strong for future hunts. This balance helps me secure my survival while being mindful of the increasing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, which means competition for food is increasing. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success. This strategy allows me to adapt to the rising wolf population and ensure my survival in a more sustainable manner.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population means competition for food is rising. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can better secure my share of the sheep while still being mindful of the need to conserve energy for future hunts. This balance will help ensure my survival in a growing pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased significantly, which means competition for food is higher. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the increased wolf population. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of successfully catching prey while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population means more competition for food. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success. This strategy allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics and ensures my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential failure. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and wait for a better opportunity to hunt when the sheep population stabilizes.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This balance allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics and ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid competition while still being able to hunt effectively when necessary.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with the increase in the wolf population, competition for food will be higher. A moderate hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a potentially scarce environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, which means food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of catching enough prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival as the competition among wolves is increasing.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy while still allowing for some hunting opportunities. This balance increases my chances of survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, which means food is scarcer. However, the wolf population has increased, leading to more competition. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can improve my chances of catching enough food while still being mindful of the risks posed by other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With 48 wolves competing for the remaining sheep, a moderate intensity will help me conserve energy while still allowing for a chance to catch prey. This balance increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, indicating that hunting may be more challenging. By increasing my intensity to 0.70, I can maximize my chances of a successful hunt while still conserving energy for future hunts, given the stable number of wolves. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still contributing to the pack's survival. This balanced approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the declining wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high due to their recent decline.
