By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the available prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balanced approach helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population increasing and the number of wolves remaining the same, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can catch enough food while also not overexerting myself. A theta of 0.70 allows me to be more efficient in hunting without competing too aggressively with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating that food is becoming scarcer. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's efforts. This balance may help ensure my survival while adapting to the current situation."
