            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the increased number of wolves. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still having a chance to catch prey without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because with 47.54 sheep and 8 wolves, the competition for food is moderate. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure enough food for survival while avoiding overexertion that could lead to unnecessary risks. This way, I can adapt to the current situation and still have energy left for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. By increasing my intensity to 0.65, I can take advantage of the higher number of sheep while still conserving energy compared to maximum intensity. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because with an increasing number of wolves, hunting at full intensity may lead to competition and less food for each wolf. By reducing my intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and avoid overhunting, ensuring I have enough resources to survive in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and with the recent increase in wolf population, hunting at a lower intensity will help ensure that I can still find food without competing too aggressively with others. This balance allows me to conserve energy and increase my chances of survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, but so has the number of wolves. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the higher sheep population while still being cautious about the competition from other wolves. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because with the increase in the wolf population, competition for food is rising. By lowering my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival in a crowded environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves is increasing, which means competition for food is rising. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of catching enough food while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a growing pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can improve my chances of securing enough food while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a growing pack.",
            "I chose this theta because with an increasing number of wolves, competition for food is rising. By reducing my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the hunt. This balance helps ensure my survival in a crowded environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving some energy. This balance helps ensure my survival in a more competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity can help conserve energy while still allowing for some hunting. This balance increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival as the wolf population is increasing.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts. This strategy increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making them more scarce. By increasing my hunting intensity, I can take advantage of the current situation while still being mindful of the increased wolf population. A balance is necessary to ensure I can secure enough food without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and reduce competition for the remaining sheep. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting may be less fruitful. By increasing my intensity slightly to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion, ensuring I remain competitive without exhausting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting more challenging. With the increase in the wolf population, competition for food is higher. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in a scarce environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to hunt effectively while still conserving energy, as the competition with other wolves remains constant.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making them scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy. This balance is crucial as the wolf population has increased, leading to more competition for food.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the wolf population is also declining. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still maintaining a chance to catch prey. This balanced approach helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is increasing. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still being effective in securing food. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the competition among wolves is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment."
