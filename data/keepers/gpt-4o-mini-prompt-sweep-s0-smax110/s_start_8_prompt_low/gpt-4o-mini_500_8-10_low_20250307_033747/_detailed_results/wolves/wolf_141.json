            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can better secure my share of the dwindling sheep population while still conserving some energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts. This strategy increases my chances of survival by avoiding overexertion in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, which means competition for food is higher among wolves. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. This strategy increases my chances of survival by avoiding competition with other wolves for limited prey.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with more wolves around, competition for food is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This balance increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with the number of wolves remaining the same, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still find enough food without overexerting myself. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive in the hunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with 45 wolves competing for food, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to overexertion and wasted energy. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and with the recent decrease in both sheep and wolves, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's survival. This balance helps ensure I can hunt effectively without overexerting myself, especially since the trend shows a decline in wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is low and the wolf population has decreased significantly. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, and with more wolves than sheep, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and scarcity. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid drawing attention while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the overall wolf population is also declining. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the remaining sheep while still being cautious. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while conserving energy and avoiding overexertion. This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the changing circumstances and increases my chances of survival without risking too much in a potentially scarce environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively, especially since the wolf population has also decreased. This balance increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is increasing.

This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. With the wolf population decreasing, a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive in the hunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the number of wolves, and hunting at a lower intensity will help conserve energy while still allowing for a chance to catch prey. This approach minimizes the risk of competition with other wolves and ensures my survival in a challenging environment.",
