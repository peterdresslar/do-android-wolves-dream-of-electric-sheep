            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and failure. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid detection while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts. This strategy increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the increase in wolves means competition for food is higher. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, which means food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival as the competition among wolves is rising.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and wasted energy. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable given the current prey availability. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and adapt to the changing environment while still contributing to the pack's survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the overall population of wolves is also declining. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still being cautious about overexerting myself in a competitive environment. This approach allows me to adapt to the changing conditions and increase my chances of survival without risking too much energy.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and reduce competition with other wolves, while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high due to their recent decline. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still being cautious, as overexerting myself could lead to failure in catching prey or attracting unwanted attention from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low, and the wolf population has decreased significantly. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to catch enough food to survive.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while conserving energy, as the competition among wolves is still high. This approach allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the wolf population is also declining. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves for limited resources. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and increase my chances of survival in the long run.",

            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is low, and the competition among wolves has increased due to their recent decrease.
