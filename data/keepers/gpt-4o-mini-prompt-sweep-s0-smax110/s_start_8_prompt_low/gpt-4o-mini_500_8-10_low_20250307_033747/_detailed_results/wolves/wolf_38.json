            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting more challenging. With an increase in the wolf population, competition for food will be higher. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.80, I can conserve energy and increase my chances of survival while still being effective in hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt, ensuring my survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy and avoid competition while still allowing for opportunistic hunting when chances arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making them more scarce. With the increase in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food without exhausting myself. A moderate increase in intensity allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics while still conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting more challenging. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts. This strategy increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making it less likely to find prey. With an increase in the wolf population, competition for food will be fierce. A lower hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being opportunistic. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves remains high. By adjusting my hunting intensity to a moderate level, I can conserve energy while still increasing my chances of catching enough prey to survive. This balance allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can strike a balance between ensuring enough food for survival while not overexerting myself in a competitive situation with other wolves. This moderate intensity allows me to adapt to the current scarcity without risking exhaustion or attracting too much attention.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's survival. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and ensures I remain strong for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low, and the population of wolves has decreased significantly. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overhunting, ensuring I have enough resources while also considering the survival of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high with their population also declining. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's survival.
