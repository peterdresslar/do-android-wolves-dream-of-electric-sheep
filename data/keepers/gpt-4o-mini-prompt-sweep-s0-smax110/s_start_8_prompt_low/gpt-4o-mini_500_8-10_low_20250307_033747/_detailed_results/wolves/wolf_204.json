            "I chose this theta because with an increasing number of wolves and a decreasing sheep population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food while conserving energy. A moderate intensity allows me to adapt to the competition while still being effective.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tighter competition for food. Increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60 allows me to be more competitive without overexerting myself, as the number of wolves has also increased. This balance helps ensure my survival while still being mindful of the available resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of securing food while still conserving energy, as the competition with other wolves remains constant.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and less food for everyone. By lowering my intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased slightly, and the number of wolves remains the same. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the hunt. This balanced approach increases my chances of survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy and avoid competition for limited prey. This way, I can still hunt effectively without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, which means hunting may be less fruitful. By adjusting my intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can maximize my chances of catching enough prey while still being mindful of the competition from other wolves. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
