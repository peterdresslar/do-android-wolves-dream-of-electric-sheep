            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still quite high compared to the number of wolves. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still contributing to the pack's overall success. This balance helps ensure my survival in a growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because with the increase in both sheep and wolves, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to balance the need for food while avoiding overexertion. By increasing my intensity slightly from my previous theta, I can take advantage of the growing sheep population without risking depletion of resources too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because with an increase in the wolf population, competition for food is higher. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased significantly, which means competition for food is higher. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid drawing attention to myself while still contributing to the pack's overall success. This strategy allows me to survive in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population means competition for food is rising. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to hunt effectively while conserving energy and avoiding overexertion. This strategy allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics of the pack and the dwindling sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, competition for food will be fierce. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid unnecessary risks while still being able to hunt when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough prey without exhausting myself. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, competition for food is higher, and a lower intensity will help conserve energy while still allowing for opportunistic hunting. This balance increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. By reducing my intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, balancing my needs with the current population dynamics.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting at maximum intensity less efficient. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid competition while still contributing to the pack's overall success.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts. This balance increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while conserving energy, as the sheep population is still relatively high.
