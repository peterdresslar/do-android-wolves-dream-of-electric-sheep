            "I chose this theta because with 10 wolves and only 8 sheep, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves and potentially deplete the sheep population too quickly. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition, ensuring my survival in the long run.",
