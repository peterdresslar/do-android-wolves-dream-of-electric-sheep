            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased significantly, which means competition for food will be higher. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.25, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population means competition for food is rising. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.5, I can balance the need to secure enough food for survival while conserving energy and avoiding overexertion. This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics without risking depletion of resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and the increase in wolves means competition for food is higher. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt when necessary.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population means competition for food is rising. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still being effective in securing enough food. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, competition for food is higher, and a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting more challenging. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can strike a balance between conserving energy and increasing my chances of catching prey, while still being mindful of the increased wolf population. This way, I can adapt to the current situation and improve my survival odds.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, the competition for food is higher, so a lower intensity will help conserve energy while still allowing me to hunt opportunistically. This way, I can adapt to the changing environment and increase my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a moderate intensity will help me conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with the number of wolves remaining the same, hunting at maximum intensity may lead to competition and depletion of resources. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and wait for a better opportunity to hunt when the sheep population stabilizes or increases.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the remaining sheep while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the overall population of wolves is also declining. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who may be hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to survive longer while waiting for better conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and the overall number of wolves is still high. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while being cautious not to overhunt, which could lead to competition with other wolves. This approach allows me to adapt to the changing environment and ensure my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is high. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and resources while still contributing to the pack's survival.
