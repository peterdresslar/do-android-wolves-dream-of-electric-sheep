            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is low compared to the number of wolves. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves for limited resources. This strategy allows me to survive longer while waiting for better opportunities.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, but the wolf population has decreased. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can balance my need for food with the risk of overexerting myself in a competitive environment. This approach allows me to conserve energy while still taking advantage of the available prey.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and the number of wolves has decreased. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still taking advantage of the available prey. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, with the decrease in the overall wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still compete for food without exhausting myself or risking injury. A theta of 0.50 allows me to be effective while conserving energy.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition is less intense, allowing me to hunt at a higher intensity without risking overexertion or depleting resources too quickly. A theta of 0.75 strikes a balance between maximizing my chances of a successful hunt while still being mindful of the overall situation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing more opportunities for hunting. However, with the number of wolves remaining the same, I need to balance my hunting intensity to avoid competition with other wolves. A slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, with the recent decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still compete effectively without overexerting myself. A theta of 0.75 allows me to hunt efficiently while conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, but the number of wolves has remained constant. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still taking advantage of the available prey. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself."
