With the wolf population decreasing, I can afford to hunt at a moderate intensity to balance my energy and ensure my survival while still contributing to the pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, with the recent decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food without risking too much energy or attracting too much competition from other wolves. A theta of 0.70 allows me to be more efficient while still being cautious.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. With the wolf population decreasing, a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This balance helps ensure my survival in a changing environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition is less intense. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can take advantage of the plentiful food while still being cautious about the risks of overexertion and potential conflicts with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population increasing and the number of wolves remaining stable, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food while avoiding overexertion. A slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and adapt to the current situation, while still being competitive.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the reduced number of wolves. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who may be hunting at maximum intensity.
