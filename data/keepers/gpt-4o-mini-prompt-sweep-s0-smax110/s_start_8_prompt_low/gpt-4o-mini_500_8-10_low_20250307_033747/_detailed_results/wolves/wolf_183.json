            "I chose this theta because with an increasing number of wolves, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and reduce my chances of survival. A moderate intensity allows me to contribute to the hunt while conserving energy and avoiding conflict with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 12 wolves competing for food, a moderate increase in hunting intensity will help me secure enough resources while minimizing the risk of overexertion and attracting too much attention from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population increasing and the number of wolves remaining constant, I need to balance my hunting efforts to ensure I can still find enough food without exhausting myself. A slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because with an increasing number of wolves, competition for food is rising. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can secure more food while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a growing pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with the number of wolves remaining stable, a slightly lower hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective. This approach balances the need to hunt with the risk of overexertion in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and I want to balance my energy expenditure with the risk of competition from other wolves. By reducing my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success.",
            "I chose this theta because with the number of sheep increasing and the wolf population remaining stable, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can catch enough food while also conserving energy. A theta of 0.65 allows me to be more efficient in my hunting without overexerting myself, which is crucial for my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance allows me to survive without risking depletion of resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a more cautious approach. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still taking advantage of the available prey. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a fluctuating environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 15 wolves competing for food, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This balance increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of successfully catching sheep while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a growing pack.",

            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased significantly, which means competition for food will be higher. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when necessary. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a more competitive environment.",
