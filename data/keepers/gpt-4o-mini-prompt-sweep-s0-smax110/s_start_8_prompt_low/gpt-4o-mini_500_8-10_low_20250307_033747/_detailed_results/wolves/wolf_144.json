            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, competition for food is increasing. A slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with an increase in the wolf population, competition for food will be fierce. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance will help ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population means more competition for food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can better secure my share of the dwindling sheep population while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making them harder to catch. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also hunting at maximum intensity. This balanced approach increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting more competitive. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of securing food while still being mindful of the increased wolf population. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population decreasing and the number of wolves remaining constant, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's survival. This way, I can adapt to the changing environment and ensure I have enough resources for myself without overexerting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with the number of wolves remaining the same, competition for food will be high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and increases my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion, ensuring I can still survive while not depleting resources too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexerting myself in a situation where prey is scarce. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current environment and increases my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to overexploitation of the remaining prey. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, ensuring my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low, and the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the situation without overexerting myself, which could lead to exhaustion or injury. This balance helps ensure my survival while still being cautious.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while conserving energy and avoiding overexertion.

            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a competitive environment.

By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and increase my chances of survival while still being able to catch enough food if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is increasing. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, which may be more aggressive. This strategy allows me to survive longer while waiting for a better opportunity to hunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. With the wolf population decreasing, a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in securing food.",
