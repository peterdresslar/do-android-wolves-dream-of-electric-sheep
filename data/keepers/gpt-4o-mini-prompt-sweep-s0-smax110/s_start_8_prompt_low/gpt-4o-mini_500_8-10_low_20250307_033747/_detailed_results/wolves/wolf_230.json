A theta of 0.60 allows me to be more efficient in my hunting without competing too aggressively with other wolves, who are still hunting at maximum intensity.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. This balance allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself, ensuring my survival in a challenging environment.",

By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can improve my chances of catching enough prey while still conserving energy. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating less food availability. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy while still being active enough to catch prey if the opportunity arises. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
