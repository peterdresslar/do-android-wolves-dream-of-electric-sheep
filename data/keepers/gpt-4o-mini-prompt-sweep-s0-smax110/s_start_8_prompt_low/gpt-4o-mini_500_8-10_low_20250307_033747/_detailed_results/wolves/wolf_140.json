            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With an increase in the wolf population, competition for food is higher. A slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts, increasing my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts. This strategy increases my chances of survival by not overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By raising my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can better secure my share of the dwindling sheep population while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid competition while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. This balance increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with the wolf population remaining the same, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food without exhausting myself. A theta of 0.75 allows me to hunt effectively while conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with the wolf population remaining constant, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves for the limited prey. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the hunt when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With fewer sheep and a declining wolf population, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the wolf population is also declining. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are likely to hunt at maximum intensity. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and with fewer prey available, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food while conserving energy. A slight increase from my previous theta allows me to be more competitive without overexerting myself, especially since the overall wolf population is also declining.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low, and the recent decrease in both sheep and wolves suggests that competition for food is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid drawing attention to myself, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still being cautious. This allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics without overexerting myself, ensuring my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the wolf population is still high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of securing food while still conserving energy, as the overall competition among wolves is high. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. With the wolf population decreasing, a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive in the hunt.",
