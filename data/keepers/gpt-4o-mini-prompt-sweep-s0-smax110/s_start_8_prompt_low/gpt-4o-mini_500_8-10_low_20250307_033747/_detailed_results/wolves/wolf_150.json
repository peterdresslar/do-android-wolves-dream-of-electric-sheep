This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the increase in wolves means competition for food is higher. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. However, the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can better compete for the limited resources while still being cautious not to exhaust myself too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By lowering my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy while still allowing for some hunting. This balance increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself in a less favorable environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival."
