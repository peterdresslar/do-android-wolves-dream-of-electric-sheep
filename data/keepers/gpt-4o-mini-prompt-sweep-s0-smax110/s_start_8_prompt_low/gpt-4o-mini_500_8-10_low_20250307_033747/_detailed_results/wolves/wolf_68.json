            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, ensuring my survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, competition for food is increasing, and a lower intensity will help conserve energy while still allowing for potential hunting opportunities. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, which means hunting at maximum intensity may not be necessary and could lead to competition with other wolves. By increasing my intensity slightly from my previous theta, I can adapt to the current situation and still secure enough food while minimizing the risk of overexertion.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in the long run.",

By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also hunting at maximum intensity. This approach increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the overall population of wolves is also declining. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still being cautious, as overhunting could lead to further depletion of resources. This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the changing environment and ensure my survival.",
