            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy while still allowing for some hunting opportunities. This way, I can adapt to the changing environment and avoid competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.40, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt, allowing me to adapt to the changing dynamics without overexerting myself. This balance helps ensure my survival as resources become scarcer.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making them scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can take advantage of the current situation while still being cautious, as the increase in the wolf population means competition is higher. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the increase in the wolf population means competition for food is higher. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can improve my chances of securing enough food while still being mindful of the risks involved with hunting more aggressively.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. By lowering my intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy while still participating in hunts, allowing me to adapt to the current situation and avoid overexertion in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, which means food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can maximize my chances of catching enough food while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still contributing to the pack's survival. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the declining wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the overall wolf population is also declining. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who may be hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey while still maintaining a chance to catch enough food for survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, and the number of wolves is also declining. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves for limited resources. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion, allowing me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the wolf population is also declining. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and resources while still contributing to the pack's survival. This approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and avoid overexertion.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the competition among wolves is high with a significant drop in their population. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to hunt effectively while conserving energy and reducing the risk of overexertion. This way, I can still contribute to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the wolf population, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to overexertion and competition with other wolves. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and increase my chances of survival while still contributing to the pack's needs.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low, and the competition among wolves has increased due to their recent decrease. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still increasing my chances of a successful hunt without overexerting myself in a potentially scarce environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, but the wolf population has decreased significantly. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still taking advantage of the available prey. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, but the wolf population has decreased.
