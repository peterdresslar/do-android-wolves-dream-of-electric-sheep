            "I chose this theta because with 10 wolves and only 8 sheep, competition for food is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. With the wolf population decreasing, a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive in the hunt. This balance helps ensure my survival in a changing environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, indicating more food availability. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests competition is less intense. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can take advantage of the abundant food while still being cautious about the remaining wolves. This balance helps ensure my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, which means there is more food available. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition is lower. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, allowing me to adapt to the changing dynamics and ensure my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition is less intense, allowing me to hunt at a higher intensity without risking overexertion. A theta of 0.75 balances the need for food with the caution required in a fluctuating environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. With the number of wolves remaining the same, a slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive in the hunt.",
