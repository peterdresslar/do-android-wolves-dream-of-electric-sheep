            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of securing enough food while still being mindful of the sheep population, which has decreased. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, competition for food is higher, so a lower intensity reduces the risk of exhausting myself without a sufficient reward. This balance helps ensure my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the wolf population has increased. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competing too aggressively with other wolves for the dwindling sheep. This strategy may help ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting more challenging. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while conserving energy for future hunts. This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the changing environment and increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, competition for food is increasing, so a lower intensity will help conserve energy while still allowing me to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with the number of wolves remaining the same, competition for food is likely to increase. By adjusting my hunting intensity to a moderate level, I can conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, ensuring my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, indicating that hunting may be less fruitful. By increasing my intensity slightly from 0.30 to 0.45, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion, especially since the wolf population has also decreased. This choice allows me to adapt to the current situation while still being cautious.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with fewer sheep available, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to wasted energy and increased competition with other wolves. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the population of sheep is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that balances my need for food with the risk of overexertion. By increasing my intensity from 0.30 to 0.50, I can take advantage of the available prey while still conserving energy for future hunts, especially given the recent decline in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the population of wolves is also declining. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to survive longer in a challenging environment while still being able to hunt when necessary.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of securing food while still being cautious, as overexerting myself could lead to competition with other wolves for limited resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of catching enough food while still conserving energy, as the overall wolf population has also decreased. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging situation.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is low, and the wolf population has decreased significantly. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",

            "I chose this theta because the decrease in the wolf population suggests increased competition for food.
