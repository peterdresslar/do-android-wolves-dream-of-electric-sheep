            "I chose this theta because with 10 wolves and only 8 sheep, the competition for food is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid drawing attention to myself, increasing my chances of survival in a resource-scarce environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the decrease in the wolf population and the increase in sheep, I need to balance my hunting efforts to ensure I can still catch enough food without overexerting myself. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition is less intense, allowing me to hunt with moderate intensity to ensure I can secure food without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests competition is still a concern. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can take advantage of the available prey while still being cautious about the risks posed by other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. With fewer wolves around, a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive in the hunt. This balance helps ensure my survival as I adapt to the changing dynamics.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population increasing and the number of wolves remaining stable, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food while avoiding overexertion. A higher theta than before allows me to be more competitive without risking depletion of resources."
