By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct confrontation, while still contributing to the hunt when necessary.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased slightly, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current environment and increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",

This will allow me to take advantage of the available prey while still being cautious, as the competition remains steady. A theta of 0.60 balances the need to secure food without overexerting myself, which could lead to unnecessary risks.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting might be less rewarding. By increasing my intensity slightly from my previous theta of 0.60, I can maximize my chances of a successful hunt while still being mindful of the dwindling prey.
