By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in the long run.",

This balance increases my chances of survival in a fluctuating environment.",

            "I chose this theta because with the number of sheep increasing slightly and the wolf population remaining stable, a lower hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still taking advantage of the available prey. This strategy reduces competition with other wolves and increases my chances of survival in the long run.",

By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy and reduce competition with other wolves while still taking advantage of the available prey. This balance helps ensure my survival in a fluctuating environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, indicating more food availability. However, the number of wolves remains the same, which means competition is still present. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly to 0.65, I can take advantage of the higher sheep numbers while still being cautious about overexerting myself and risking injury or depletion of energy.",
