            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and with 17 wolves competing for food, a slightly increased intensity will help me secure enough resources while still being cautious. This balance allows me to hunt effectively without overexerting myself, considering the competition.",
            "I chose this theta because with the increase in the wolf population, competition for food is likely to be higher. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success. This strategy allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics and ensures my survival in a more competitive environment.",
