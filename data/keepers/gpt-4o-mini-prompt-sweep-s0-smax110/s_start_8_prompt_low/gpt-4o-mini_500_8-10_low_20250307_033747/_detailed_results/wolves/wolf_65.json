            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With the increase in the wolf population, competition for food will be higher. By reducing my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, competition for food is high, and a lower intensity will help conserve energy while still allowing me to hunt effectively. This balance increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. However, with the increase in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still compete for food without exhausting myself. A theta of 0.60 allows me to hunt effectively while conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, which means there is less food available. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to survive longer while waiting for the sheep population to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid attracting attention from other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer wolves, competition for food is less intense. A moderate hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still increasing my chances of catching prey, ensuring my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively low, and the competition among wolves is high due to their recent decrease. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's needs. This strategy allows me to survive longer in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still conserving energy and avoiding overexertion. This approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity while still being cautious.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high with their population also declining. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment.

            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to wasted energy and increased competition with other wolves. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the competition among wolves is high due to their recent decline. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy and avoiding overexertion in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in the wolf population suggests increased competition for food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while conserving energy, as the sheep population is relatively stable. This approach allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the number of wolves, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves for the same prey. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid drawing attention, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, with the recent decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food without overexerting myself and risking injury or exhaustion. A moderate intensity allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics while still being effective.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the number of wolves, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves and potential overhunting. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid unnecessary risks while still contributing to the pack's survival.",

A theta of 0.65 allows me to hunt effectively without risking exhaustion or attracting too much attention.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. By raising my intensity slightly from 0.65 to 0.75, I can increase my chances of a successful hunt while still conserving energy for future needs. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself, especially since the number of wolves remains unchanged.",
