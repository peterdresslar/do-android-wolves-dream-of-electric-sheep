            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, and the number of wolves is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves for the dwindling sheep. This strategy allows me to survive longer while waiting for a more favorable hunting opportunity.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased slightly, indicating a potential for more food. However, with the number of wolves remaining the same, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough prey without overexerting myself. A theta of 0.40 allows me to be more efficient while still being cautious.",
            "I chose this theta because with the current number of sheep decreasing and the wolf population stable, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food without overexerting myself. A theta of 0.60 allows me to be more efficient in my hunting while conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting more challenging. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts. This strategy increases my chances of survival by avoiding competition with other wolves for limited resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased slightly, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's efforts. This balanced approach allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself, ensuring my survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population decreasing, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food while avoiding overexertion. A slightly higher intensity than before allows me to be competitive without risking depletion of resources.",
