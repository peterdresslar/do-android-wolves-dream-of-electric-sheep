            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making them a scarcer resource. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and risk. By increasing my intensity slightly to 0.60, I can balance the need to hunt effectively while still being cautious about overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and the number of wolves has increased. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively when necessary. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting more challenging. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can better compete with other wolves while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a changing environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making them a more valuable resource. With the increase in the wolf population, hunting at a higher intensity will increase my chances of securing food while still being mindful of the competition. A theta of 0.75 balances the need for food with the risk of overexertion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable given the current prey availability. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can strike a balance between securing enough food for survival while not overexerting myself, which could lead to exhaustion or injury. This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the current situation and remain competitive among the other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while conserving energy, as the overall prey availability is low. This approach allows me to adapt to the changing environment and improve my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a scarcity of food. With fewer sheep available and a decline in the wolf population, a lower hunting intensity will help conserve energy and increase my chances of survival. By not competing at maximum intensity, I can avoid attracting attention and potentially find opportunities to hunt more effectively when conditions improve.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves for limited resources. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves for limited resources. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment.

            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the decreased number of wolves.

This approach allows me to secure enough resources without overexerting myself or risking injury in a potentially competitive hunt.",
