A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, competition for food is higher, and a lower intensity will help conserve energy while still allowing me to hunt effectively. This balance increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making food scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival, especially with the increasing number of wolves competing for the same resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and reduce competition while still allowing for some hunting opportunities.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of catching enough prey while still being cautious about overexerting myself, given that the wolf population remains stable.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy while still allowing for opportunistic hunting. This balance increases my chances of survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting may be more challenging. By increasing my intensity slightly to 0.60, I can improve my chances of a successful hunt while still conserving energy for future needs. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still being mindful of the increased competition from other wolves. A theta of 0.75 balances the need for food with the risk of overexertion.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the wolf population is still high. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.5, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still contributing to the hunt. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively low, and the number of wolves is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment."
