            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, which means food is scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at a higher intensity will increase my chances of securing food while still being cautious not to overexert myself and risk injury or failure.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With an increase in the wolf population, competition for food will be higher. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid competition while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy and avoid competition while still allowing for opportunistic hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making them a scarcer resource. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can take advantage of the current situation while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival amidst the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and reduce competition for the remaining sheep. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with the wolf population remaining the same, competition for food will be intense. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of securing enough food while still being cautious not to overexert myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I aim to balance the need for food while still conserving energy, as the competition among wolves is high. This approach allows me to adapt to the current situation and improve my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's survival. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the declining wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the wolf population is still high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves for scarce resources. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a more competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while conserving energy, as the sheep population is low. This approach allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics and ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to wasted energy and increased competition with other wolves. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a more competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while conserving energy, as hunting at maximum intensity may lead to exhaustion or failure. This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the changing conditions and increases my chances of survival.",
