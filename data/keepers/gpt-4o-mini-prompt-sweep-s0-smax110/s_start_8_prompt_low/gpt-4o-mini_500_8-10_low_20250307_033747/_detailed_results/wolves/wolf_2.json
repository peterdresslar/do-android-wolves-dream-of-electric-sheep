            "I chose this theta because with 10 wolves and only 8 sheep, the competition for food is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid drawing attention to myself, increasing my chances of survival in a scarce environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, with the number of wolves decreasing, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch prey while not overexerting myself. A moderate intensity allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics and increases my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, but the wolf population has decreased. This suggests that there may be less competition for food, allowing me to hunt at a lower intensity while still being able to secure enough resources for survival. A lower theta also conserves energy, which is crucial given the recent decline in my pack."
