            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making them a scarcer resource. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential failure. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This approach allows me to adapt to the current situation and increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can better compete with other wolves while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and with the wolf population remaining stable, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food without overexerting myself. A slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and I want to increase my chances of a successful hunt without overexerting myself. A theta of 0.75 allows me to be competitive with other wolves while conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less predictable. By lowering my intensity slightly, I can conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This also allows me to adapt to the current situation, as the competition among wolves remains constant.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that food is becoming scarcer. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to survive longer while waiting for better opportunities.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population decreasing, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food without exhausting myself. A slightly higher intensity than before allows me to take advantage of the current situation while still being cautious, as the number of wolves remains the same.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the wolf population is also declining. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can take advantage of the available sheep while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a dwindling population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the number of wolves, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves for the same prey. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct confrontation, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, with the recent decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food while conserving energy for survival. A theta of 0.60 allows me to take advantage of the sheep while being cautious about the risks of overexertion.",
