            "I chose this theta because with an increase in the wolf population and a slight decrease in sheep, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves for limited resources. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid drawing attention while still participating in the hunt when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing more opportunities for hunting. However, with the number of wolves remaining constant, I need to balance my hunting intensity to avoid competition with other wolves. A moderate intensity allows me to hunt effectively while conserving energy for future needs.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased slightly, and the wolf population has increased. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.40, I can take advantage of the current situation without overexerting myself, which could lead to competition with other wolves. This balance helps ensure my survival while still contributing to the pack's success.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, with the number of wolves remaining the same, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food without overexerting myself. A theta of 0.50 allows me to be more efficient while still being cautious.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, which means food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of catching enough food while still being cautious about overexerting myself, given the rising number of wolves competing for the same resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means food is becoming scarcer. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the increase in the wolf population, competition for food is likely to intensify. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can better secure my share of the dwindling sheep population while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a more competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased slightly, indicating that hunting may be less fruitful. By lowering my intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, allowing me to adapt to the current situation and ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the number of wolves has increased. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still contributing to the pack's overall success. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and ensure my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 19 wolves competing for food, a moderate hunting intensity will allow me to secure enough resources without overexerting myself. This balance helps ensure my survival while still being competitive.",
