            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, competition for food is increasing, so a lower intensity will help conserve energy while still allowing for opportunistic hunting. This balance will ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential failure. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, and the number of wolves is increasing. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to catch enough food to survive. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, which means hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive in the hunt, especially with an increasing wolf population. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential failure. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and less food for everyone. By choosing a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making it less likely to find enough food if I hunt at maximum intensity. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, who are also increasing in number. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to hunt effectively while conserving energy and avoiding overexertion. This approach allows me to adapt to the changing environment and increases my chances of survival without competing too aggressively with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can improve my chances of catching enough food while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival, especially with the wolf population remaining constant.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, which means there is less food available. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy while still being active enough to catch prey when opportunities arise. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the population of sheep has decreased, making them scarcer. With fewer sheep available, hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable and could lead to competition with other wolves. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and the number of wolves has also decreased. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who may be hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to survive longer while waiting for the sheep population to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion, ensuring I have enough energy to survive while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively low, and the number of wolves has decreased significantly. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can better compete for food without overexerting myself, which is crucial for my survival given the recent trends.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting more challenging. By increasing my intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of a successful hunt while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival given the declining wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a scarcity of resources. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment."
