            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and with the recent increase in wolves, hunting at full intensity could lead to competition and reduce my chances of survival. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased slightly, indicating a potential scarcity of food. With an increase in the wolf population, competition for resources is likely to be higher. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid competition while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased slightly, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure enough food while conserving energy for future hunts, especially with the rising number of wolves competing for the same resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With an increase in the wolf population, competition for food will be higher. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of successfully hunting while still conserving some energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making them more scarce. With an increase in the wolf population, hunting at a higher intensity will increase my chances of securing food while still being mindful of the competition. A theta of 0.75 balances the need for food with the risks of overexertion.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the increase in wolves means competition for food is higher. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting may be more challenging.

This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment.",

By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food.

This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making them scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with increasing wolf numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the wolf population is still high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of securing food while still being cautious about overexerting myself, given the declining wolf population.",

By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This strategy may help me survive in a challenging environment.",

            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food without overexerting myself. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has decreased significantly, indicating increased competition for food.
