By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion, ensuring I have enough energy to survive while still contributing to the pack",

This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity and ensures my survival without risking too much energy.",

This approach allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics and ensure my survival.",

            "I chose this theta because with the decrease in the wolf population, competition for food is likely to be more intense. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can maximize my chances of securing enough food while still being cautious, as the sheep population is not excessively high. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
