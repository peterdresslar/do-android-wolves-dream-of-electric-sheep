            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, and the number of wolves has increased. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the wolf population has increased. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still being cautious, as other wolves may also be hunting aggressively. This way, I can ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the number of wolves. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are likely to hunt at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to survive longer and wait for a more favorable opportunity to hunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making them scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at a higher intensity will increase my chances of catching enough food to survive. However, I don",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating that hunting may be more challenging. However, the increase in the wolf population suggests that competition for food is rising. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I aim to balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion, ensuring I can still compete effectively without exhausting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population decreasing and the wolf population increasing, hunting at a slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased slightly, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can maximize my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating less food availability. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the increase in wolves means competition for food is higher. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
