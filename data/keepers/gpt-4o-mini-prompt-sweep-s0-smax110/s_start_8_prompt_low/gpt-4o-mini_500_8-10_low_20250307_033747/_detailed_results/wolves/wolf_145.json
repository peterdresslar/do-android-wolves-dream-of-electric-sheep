            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.65, I can balance the need to secure enough food while avoiding overexertion that could lead to exhaustion or injury. This moderate intensity allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics of the pack and the declining sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and reduce competition for the remaining prey. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the increase in the wolf population means competition for food is rising. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still being mindful of the risks posed by other wolves. A balanced approach will help ensure my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting more challenging. However, the increase in the wolf population suggests competition is rising. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of securing food while still being cautious about overexerting myself in a potentially scarce environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and while the number of wolves remains the same, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food without overexerting myself. A slightly higher intensity than my previous choice allows me to adapt to the changing environment while still conserving energy.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with the number of wolves remaining the same, hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and increase my chances of survival while still participating in the hunt. This way, I can adapt to the current situation and avoid overexertion.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high with their numbers also declining. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and increase my chances of survival while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is low and the competition among wolves is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid attracting attention from other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion. This way, I can still contribute to my survival while being cautious, as other wolves may also be competing for the same resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the number of wolves, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves for limited resources. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion. This way, I can still contribute to my survival while being mindful of the dwindling resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, I need to increase my hunting intensity to ensure I can secure enough food for survival.
