By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still being cautious, as the population of wolves is declining. This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself or risking injury.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to wasted energy and increased competition with other wolves. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's survival.",

By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still being cautious, as overhunting could lead to competition with other wolves. This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the changing environment and ensure my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low, and the recent decrease in both sheep and wolves suggests that hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and increase my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",

A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the competition among wolves is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competing directly with other wolves for the dwindling prey. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low, and the competition among wolves has increased due to their recent decrease. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still being effective in securing food. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, but the wolf population has decreased significantly. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still taking advantage of the available prey. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, indicating a potential for a successful hunt. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests competition is fierce.
