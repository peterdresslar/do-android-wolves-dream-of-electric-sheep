            "I chose this theta because the increase in both sheep and wolves suggests a more competitive environment. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can balance my energy expenditure while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and with the recent increase in wolves, hunting at a lower intensity will help ensure that I do not overexert myself and can still find food without competing too aggressively with others. This balance will help me survive in a growing pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high, and with an increase in the wolf population, hunting at a moderate intensity will allow me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the wolf population, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity. By increasing my theta slightly from 0.50 to 0.65, I can take advantage of the sheep availability while still conserving energy for future hunts, ensuring my survival in a growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased significantly, which means competition for food will be tougher. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's overall success. This balance helps ensure my survival in a more competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still significantly higher than the number of wolves, allowing for a sustainable hunt without overexerting myself. By increasing my intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the recent increase in the wolf population while still being cautious to ensure my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population means more competition for food. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively. This balance helps ensure my survival in a crowded environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. However, the wolf population has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still being mindful of the risks involved with higher competition.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population means competition for food is rising. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively. This balance allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics and ensure my survival without risking depletion of resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, and the number of wolves is increasing. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves for the dwindling sheep. This strategy allows me to survive longer while waiting for better conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and risk. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, balancing my need for food with the need to avoid overexertion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with the increase in the wolf population, competition for food will be higher. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.40, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when necessary. This strategy allows me to adapt to the changing environment and ensure my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can better secure food for myself while still being cautious, as the sheep population has decreased. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential failure. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid drawing attention while still contributing to the pack's success.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making them scarcer. With more wolves around, I need to increase my hunting intensity to ensure I can secure enough food for survival. However, I don't want to overexert myself and risk injury or exhaustion, so a moderate increase to 0.60 seems optimal.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and reduce competition for the remaining sheep. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation while still ensuring my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with the wolf population remaining constant, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food while not exhausting myself. A moderate intensity allows me to adapt to the changing environment and increases my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with the number of wolves remaining the same, competition for food will be fierce. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
