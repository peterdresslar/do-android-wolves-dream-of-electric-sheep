            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential failure. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid drawing attention while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and less food for me. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, balancing my needs with the current situation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with an increase in the wolf population, competition for food will be higher. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's needs. This strategy allows me to adapt to the changing environment and ensure my survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making them scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to hunt effectively while conserving energy for future hunts, as the wolf population is rising and competition for food will be tougher.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, which means food is scarcer. With more wolves around, I need to increase my hunting intensity to compete effectively for the limited resources while still being cautious not to overexert myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with the number of wolves remaining the same, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to overexploitation of the remaining sheep. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and ensure that I have enough resources for future hunts while still contributing to the pack's survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, which means there are fewer opportunities for hunting. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can maximize my chances of catching enough food while still being mindful of the competition with other wolves. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the overall population of wolves is also declining. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to overexploitation of the remaining sheep. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and ensure my survival while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is increasing. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while conserving energy and avoiding overexertion.

            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With fewer sheep available, a lower hunting intensity will help conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, who are also struggling.

By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while conserving energy for future hunts. This approach allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself, given the declining sheep population.",
