            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means food is becoming scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential failure to catch prey. By lowering my intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and increase my chances of survival while still contributing to the pack's success.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased slightly, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and with 22 wolves competing for food, a moderate increase in hunting intensity will help me secure enough resources without overexerting myself. This balance allows me to remain competitive while conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and reduce competition for food. This way, I can still hunt effectively without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting may be less fruitful. By increasing my intensity slightly, I can maximize my chances of a successful hunt while still conserving energy for future needs. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, which means food is becoming scarcer. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.6, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and increases my chances of survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my intensity from 0.60 to 0.75, I can improve my chances of securing enough food while still being mindful of the competition from other wolves. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because with the number of sheep decreasing and wolves remaining constant, a slightly reduced hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive. This way, I can adapt to the changing environment and increase my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can maximize my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy while still being active enough to hunt when opportunities arise. This balanced approach helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my intensity to 0.75, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival as the competition among wolves remains high.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and increase my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves while still contributing to the pack's survival. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and ensure my own survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the number of wolves, and hunting at a lower intensity may help me conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves. By being strategic and not overexerting myself, I can increase my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in the wolf population suggests that hunting at maximum intensity may lead to competition with other wolves for the same prey. By choosing a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt, increasing my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the number of wolves, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid unnecessary confrontations, increasing my chances of survival in the long run.",
