            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting more challenging. With an increase in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to avoid competition with other wolves while still ensuring I can secure enough food for survival. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy and adapt to the changing environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting more competitive. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.65, I can better compete with other wolves while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, competition for food is higher, so a lower intensity will help conserve energy while still allowing for opportunistic hunting. This balance increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, I need to increase my hunting intensity to compete effectively for the limited resources. A theta of 0.60 strikes a balance between conserving energy and increasing my chances of a successful hunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and increase my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the wolf population is also declining. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also struggling. This strategy allows me to survive longer while waiting for conditions to improve.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey without overexerting myself, which could lead to exhaustion or injury. A moderate approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity while still being cautious.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while conserving energy, as the sheep population is still relatively high. This approach allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the wolf population is also declining. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who may be hunting at maximum intensity.

            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a more competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while conserving energy, as the sheep population is still relatively low. This approach allows me to adapt to the changing circumstances without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low, and the recent decrease in both sheep and wolves suggests that competition for food is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",

This approach allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to wasted energy and increased competition with other wolves. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in the wolf population suggests increased competition for food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while conserving energy, as the sheep population is relatively stable. This approach allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics without overexerting myself.",
