By increasing my hunting intensity from 0.60 to 0.75, I can improve my chances of catching enough food while still being cautious about overexerting myself in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting may be more challenging. By lowering my intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This approach allows me to adapt to the current situation and increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can maximize my chances of catching enough food while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.
