            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the increased number of wolves. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can still contribute to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased significantly, which means competition for food will be tougher. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching enough prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a growing pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population means competition for food is rising. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can better secure my share of the dwindling sheep population while still conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With an increase in the number of wolves, competition for food will be higher. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's efforts. This balance will help ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population means more competition for food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can improve my chances of securing enough food while still being mindful of the dwindling sheep population. This balance allows me to hunt effectively without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise. This balance increases my chances of survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making them scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and overexertion without a sufficient reward. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, adapting to the current situation.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making it more challenging to find food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still being mindful of the increased competition from other wolves. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting at maximum intensity less effective.

By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, indicating that hunting may be less fruitful. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also struggling. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity and increases my chances of survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the overall population of wolves is also declining. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and resources while still contributing to the pack's survival. This cautious approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and avoid overexertion.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high with their numbers also declining. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still conserving energy and avoiding overexertion in a challenging environment."
