            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 41\n- Sheep population: 41.34\n- Wolf population: 28.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.350\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 1.48 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 37.6% of maximum capacity\n\nEcosystem observations:\n- The wolf population is moderately high.\n- The ratio of sheep to wolves is becoming less favorable, which may require adaptation.\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

This will help support the growth of the wolf population while still allowing for the sheep to recover and thrive. A moderate increase will help maintain balance without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there is room for increased hunting without risking the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 57.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with a relatively low wolf population, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 59.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still a healthy number of sheep available. However, with a wolf population of 10, I need to be cautious about over-hunting. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still providing enough resources for the wolf pack to thrive. This moderate adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful at 68.43, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a sustainable balance. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to capitalize on the current sheep availability without risking depletion, while also considering the growth of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful at 70.66, which allows for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can still recover. A theta of 0.55 strikes a balance between competing with other wolves and hunting, promoting sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful at 72.13, and it is at 65.6% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still ensuring that the sheep population can sustain itself. A moderate increase to 0.60 maintains a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure sustainable coexistence, I need to balance hunting with the competition among wolves. A moderate theta allows for some hunting to support reproduction while giving sheep a chance to recover.",
