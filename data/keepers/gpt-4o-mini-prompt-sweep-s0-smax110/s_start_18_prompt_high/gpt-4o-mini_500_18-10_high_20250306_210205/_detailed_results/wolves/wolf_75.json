A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while still ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. This moderate approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments to adapt to changing conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, a moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain our wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. This adjustment allows for a gradual response to the changing conditions while keeping both populations in balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while still enabling the wolf population to thrive. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 41.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. However, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, suggesting that I should focus on reducing hunting intensity slightly to allow the sheep to recover while still competing with other wolves. A moderate adjustment will help maintain balance without risking a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 41.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is some room for increased hunting without risking depletion. However, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, so a moderate increase in hunting intensity allows for sustainable coexistence while also considering the need to adapt to changing conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain our population while allowing for some recovery of the sheep. This adjustment is gradual, aligning with the wisdom of adapting to changing conditions without causing drastic shifts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 41.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, suggesting that I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance while allowing the sheep population to recover."
