This adjustment will help support wolf population growth while still ensuring that the sheep can recover and maintain their numbers. A gradual increase in theta aligns with the current sheep-to-wolf ratio, which indicates that there are enough sheep to sustain both hunting and the long-term health of the ecosystem.",

This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still maintaining a sustainable balance. A moderate increase to 0.60 will help ensure our pack can grow without depleting the sheep population too quickly.",
