This adjustment reflects the need to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly. A gradual approach helps ensure long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, and we are at a sustainable sheep-to-wolf ratio. Increasing my hunting intensity slightly will help ensure the wolf population remains healthy while still allowing for the sheep population to recover and thrive. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",

With a moderately high wolf population and a sheep-to-wolf ratio that is becoming less favorable, a slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow sheep to stabilize while still enabling wolves to thrive. This balanced approach supports long-term coexistence.",

A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling us to compete effectively with other wolves. This adjustment aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence.",
