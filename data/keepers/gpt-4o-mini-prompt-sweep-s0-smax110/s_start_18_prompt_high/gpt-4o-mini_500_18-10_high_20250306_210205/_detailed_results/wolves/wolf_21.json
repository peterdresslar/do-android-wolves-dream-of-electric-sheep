A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments to ensure long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain the balance as the sheep population grows, while also considering the need to avoid over-depleting their numbers. A gradual increase is essential to ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A moderate increase to 0.45 allows for some growth in the wolf population while still enabling the sheep to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still providing enough resources for the wolf population to thrive. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that I need to focus more on competition with other wolves to prevent overhunting. A slight decrease in hunting intensity allows the sheep population to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population."
