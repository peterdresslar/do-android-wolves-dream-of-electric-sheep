However, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, suggesting that I should be cautious about increasing hunting intensity too quickly. A slight decrease in theta allows for a more balanced approach, enabling the sheep population to recover while still supporting the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating a need to focus on competition with other wolves rather than intensifying hunting. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 41.5% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, so a gradual increase in hunting will help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 41.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, suggesting that I should be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between both populations."
