            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful at 72.00, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a sustainable balance. This value reflects a slight adjustment from my previous theta, promoting coexistence while ensuring the wolf population remains healthy.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, but the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A moderate hunting intensity will allow for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves. This approach balances the need to maintain our population with the necessity of allowing the sheep to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A lower theta will allow me to focus on competing with other wolves, which can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
