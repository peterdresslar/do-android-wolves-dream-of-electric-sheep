A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while still maintaining enough pressure to ensure wolf reproduction. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and promotes a sustainable balance.",

By lowering the hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing competition among wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 43.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, suggesting that I should be cautious and not overhunt. A moderate increase to 0.40 allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that we need to focus more on competition with other wolves to allow the sheep population to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance while ensuring our long-term survival.",

However, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, suggesting that I should be cautious and avoid overhunting.
