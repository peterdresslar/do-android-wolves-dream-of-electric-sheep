            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while still enabling the wolf population to thrive. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that we need to focus on competing with other wolves to stabilize our population while allowing the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain balance without risking the depletion of sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, suggesting that I should be cautious and not increase hunting intensity too aggressively. A slight increase to 0.40 allows for some hunting while still considering the long-term balance between both populations.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight reduction in hunting intensity allows for a more balanced approach, giving sheep a chance to recover while still ensuring the wolf population remains healthy.",

This gradual adjustment allows for a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring enough food for our pack.",
