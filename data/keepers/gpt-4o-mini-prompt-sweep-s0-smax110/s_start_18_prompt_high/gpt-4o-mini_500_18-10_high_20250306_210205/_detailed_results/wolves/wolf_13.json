            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 43\n- Sheep population: 40.63\n- Wolf population: 26.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.300\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 1.56 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 36.9% of maximum capacity\n\nEcosystem observations:\n- The wolf population is moderately high.\n- The ratio of sheep to wolves is becoming less favorable, which may require adaptation.\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3. Adjust your hunting intensity gradually in response to population changes\n4. Find a balance that creates sustainable cycles rather than crashes\n5.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 57.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with a low wolf population, it is wise to focus on competition with other wolves to ensure our numbers can grow. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while also giving sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without overly depleting the sheep population. It reflects a cautious approach to ensure sustainability as both populations are dynamic.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful at 68.43, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly, aligning with the goal of sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful at 70.66, which allows for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful at 72.13, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help ensure the wolf population can thrive while still maintaining a sustainable balance with the sheep. Given that the sheep are at 65.6% of their maximum capacity, a moderate increase in hunting will support our needs without risking a rapid depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity from 0.600 to 0.550, I can ensure the wolf population remains healthy while still allowing for some sheep reproduction. This adjustment reflects the current state of the ecosystem and aims for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful at 72.00, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still maintaining a sustainable balance with the sheep population, which is currently at 65.5% of its maximum capacity. A moderate increase to 0.60 reflects a cautious approach to ensure long-term survival for both species.",

A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow for a more sustainable balance, enabling both populations to thrive without depleting resources too quickly.",

A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, allowing sheep to recover while preventing overcompetition among wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining sustainable cycles.",
