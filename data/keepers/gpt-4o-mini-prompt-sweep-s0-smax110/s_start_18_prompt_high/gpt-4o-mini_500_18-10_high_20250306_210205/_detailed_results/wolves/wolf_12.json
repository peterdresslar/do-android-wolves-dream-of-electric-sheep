            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 42\n- Sheep population: 41.10\n- Wolf population: 27.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.400\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 1.52 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 37.4% of maximum capacity\n\nEcosystem observations:\n- The wolf population is moderately high.\n- The ratio of sheep to wolves is becoming less favorable, which may require adaptation.\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for increased hunting intensity without risking depletion. With a low wolf population and a high sheep-to-wolf ratio, I can afford to hunt more aggressively to support wolf reproduction while still maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 57.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with a relatively low wolf population, I want to ensure that we do not over-deplete the sheep, so a moderate increase in hunting intensity is appropriate to support our growth while maintaining balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 59.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep. A moderate hunting intensity of 0.55 allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves. This approach balances the need for food with the necessity of not depleting the sheep population too quickly, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful at 68.43, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful at 70.66, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity while still ensuring sustainability. This value reflects a balanced approach, enabling us to maintain our wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover and thrive.",
