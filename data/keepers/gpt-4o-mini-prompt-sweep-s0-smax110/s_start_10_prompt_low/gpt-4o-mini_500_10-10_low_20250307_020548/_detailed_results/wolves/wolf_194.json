By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy while still being active enough to catch prey if the opportunity arises. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",

By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's overall success. This balanced approach allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself, ensuring my survival in the long run.",
