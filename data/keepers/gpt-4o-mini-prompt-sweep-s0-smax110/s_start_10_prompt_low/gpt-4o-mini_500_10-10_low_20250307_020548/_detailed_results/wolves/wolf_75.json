            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and failure to catch prey. A slightly increased intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being proactive in securing food.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and with more wolves around, a moderate hunting intensity will allow me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential failure. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, balancing the need for food with the risk of overexertion.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can better secure my share of the dwindling sheep population while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the increase in the wolf population means competition for food is rising. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This balanced approach helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can still be effective in hunting while conserving energy and reducing the risk of overexertion. This balance will help ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the wolf population is increasing. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the wolf population has increased. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves for the remaining sheep. This strategy allows me to survive longer while waiting for a more favorable situation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overhunting, ensuring my survival while still being cautious about the dwindling sheep numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting may be less fruitful if I go all out. By increasing my intensity slightly to 0.70, I can still be competitive without overexerting myself, allowing for a balance between energy conservation and the need to secure food.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, which means hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's survival. This balance allows me to adapt to the current situation and avoid overexertion in a declining prey environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the number of wolves, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves for limited resources. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct confrontation, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high due to their recent decline. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still increasing my chances of a successful hunt without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the competition among wolves is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's survival.

            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while conserving energy. This approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the competition from other wolves, ensuring my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the wolf population is also declining. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment.
