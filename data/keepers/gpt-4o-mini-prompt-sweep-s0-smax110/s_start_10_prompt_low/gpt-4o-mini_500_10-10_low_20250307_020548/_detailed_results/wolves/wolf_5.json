            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is low and the competition with other wolves is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This strategy allows me to survive in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. With the wolf population decreasing, a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive in securing food. This balance helps ensure my survival in a changing environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, with the recent decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still secure enough food while avoiding overexertion. A theta of 0.65 allows me to be more efficient in hunting without risking my energy reserves too much.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, but the wolf population has decreased. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and increase my chances of survival while still contributing to the hunt. This balanced approach allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because with 12.53 sheep and 7 wolves, the competition for food is moderate. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly to 0.65, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a situation where resources are available but not abundant.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, with the recent decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still compete with others while also conserving energy. A theta of 0.75 allows me to hunt effectively without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population increasing and the number of wolves remaining stable, a slightly lower hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves. This way, I can still contribute to the hunt without overexerting myself, ensuring my survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, but the wolf population has decreased. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.40, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still taking advantage of the available prey. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. By increasing my intensity to 0.60, I can take advantage of the higher availability of prey while still conserving energy compared to maximum intensity. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself, especially since the number of wolves has remained constant."
