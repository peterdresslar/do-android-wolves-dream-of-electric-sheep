By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can improve my chances of catching enough food while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a growing wolf population.",

            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. This balance increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, indicating a scarcity of food. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt if the opportunity arises. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",

A moderate approach allows me to adapt to the changing environment while still being cautious.",

By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves for dwindling resources. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
