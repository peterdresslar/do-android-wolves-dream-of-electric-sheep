            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still increasing my chances of catching prey without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population means competition for food is rising. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to hunt effectively while conserving energy for future hunts. This approach allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased slightly, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of successfully hunting while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",

This balance is crucial for my survival, especially with the rising number of wolves competing for the same resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This balanced approach helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.40, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who may be hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating that hunting may be more challenging. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly to 0.60, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts, given that the wolf population remains stable.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that food is becoming scarcer.
