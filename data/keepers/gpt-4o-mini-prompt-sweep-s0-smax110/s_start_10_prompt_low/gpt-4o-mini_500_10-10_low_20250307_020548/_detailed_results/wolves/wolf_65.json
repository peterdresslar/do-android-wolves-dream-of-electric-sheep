            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival in a crowded environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can better secure my share of the sheep while still being mindful of the need to conserve energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means food is becoming scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and overexploitation of the remaining sheep. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and less food for everyone. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means food is becoming scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and overexploitation of the remaining sheep. By lowering my intensity to 0.30, I can conserve energy and still have a chance to hunt effectively without risking a confrontation with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still increasing my chances of catching prey. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With an increase in the wolf population, competition for food will be higher. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.65, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy, as I don",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting more competitive among wolves. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting more competitive. With more wolves around, a higher intensity will increase my chances of securing food while still being mindful of the risks involved in overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, competition is fierce, and a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being part of the hunt. This balance increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, competition for food is high, and a lower intensity will help conserve energy while still allowing me to hunt effectively. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while conserving energy, as the competition with other wolves remains high. This approach allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting may be less fruitful if I go all out. By increasing my intensity slightly from my previous theta, I can still take advantage of the current situation while conserving energy for future hunts, ensuring my survival in a fluctuating environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the wolf population is still high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
