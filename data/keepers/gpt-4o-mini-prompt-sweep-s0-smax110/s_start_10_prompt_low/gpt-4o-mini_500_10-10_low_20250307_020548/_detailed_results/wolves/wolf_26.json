            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With the increase in the wolf population, competition for food is higher. By reducing my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity may lead to competition and exhaustion. A slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population means competition for food is rising. With fewer sheep available, a lower hunting intensity will help conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still allowing for some hunting. This balance increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making them a more valuable resource. With an increase in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can secure enough food while also being mindful of competition. A slightly higher intensity than my previous choice allows me to be more competitive without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential failure. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and reduce competition for the remaining sheep. This strategy allows me to survive longer while waiting for better opportunities.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests that competition for food will be higher. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can better secure food for myself while still being cautious, as the sheep population has decreased. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with the number of wolves remaining the same, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to overexploitation of the remaining sheep. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can help ensure that there are enough sheep left for future hunts, which is crucial for my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, which means hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. By increasing my intensity slightly from my previous theta, I can take advantage of the current situation while still being cautious about the dwindling prey. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and the number of wolves is still high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves for limited prey. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This approach balances my need for survival with the current scarcity of prey.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion, ensuring I can still survive while not depleting resources too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the wolf population is also declining. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and increase my chances of survival while waiting for a more favorable situation. This approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the competition among wolves is high due to their recent decline.
