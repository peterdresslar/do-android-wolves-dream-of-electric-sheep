            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. With more wolves around, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food without exhausting myself or attracting too much attention from other wolves. A moderate increase in theta allows me to be more competitive while still conserving energy.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy while still allowing me to hunt effectively. This balance increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting might be more challenging. By increasing my intensity slightly from 0.45 to 0.55, I can improve my chances of a successful hunt while still conserving energy for future needs. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a potentially scarce environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at full intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of securing food while still conserving energy, as the overall wolf population remains stable. This balance is crucial for my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy and avoid competition while still allowing for some hunting. This balance increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food while conserving energy.
