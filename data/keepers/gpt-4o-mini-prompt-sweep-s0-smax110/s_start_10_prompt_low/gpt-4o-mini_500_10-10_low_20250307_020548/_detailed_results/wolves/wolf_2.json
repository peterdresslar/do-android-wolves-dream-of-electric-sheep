            "I chose this theta because the current population of sheep is stable, and with 10 wolves, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to overhunting and depletion of resources. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and ensure my survival while still contributing to the pack's needs.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, but the wolf population has decreased. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can balance the need for food while also being cautious of the reduced wolf numbers, which may lead to increased competition among us. This approach allows me to secure enough resources without overexerting myself in a potentially risky environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting. However, with the recent decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still contribute to the pack's survival while not overexerting myself. A theta of 0.70 allows me to hunt effectively while being cautious."
