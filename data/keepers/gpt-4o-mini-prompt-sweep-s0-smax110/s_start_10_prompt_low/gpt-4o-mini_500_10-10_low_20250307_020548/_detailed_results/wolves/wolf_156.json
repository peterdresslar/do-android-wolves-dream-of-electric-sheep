            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A slightly higher intensity than before allows me to be more effective while conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and I want to balance my energy expenditure with the need to hunt effectively. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being proactive in securing food, especially since the other wolves are also competing for the same resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making hunting more competitive. By increasing my intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while conserving energy, as the number of wolves is rising. This way, I can adapt to the changing environment and improve my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means food is becoming scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and overexploitation of the remaining sheep.

By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion. This way, I can still hunt effectively while conserving energy for future hunts, ensuring my survival in a challenging environment.",

By increasing my intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of successfully hunting while still conserving energy for future needs. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment.",

By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.40, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and avoid overexertion, ensuring my survival in a challenging environment.",
