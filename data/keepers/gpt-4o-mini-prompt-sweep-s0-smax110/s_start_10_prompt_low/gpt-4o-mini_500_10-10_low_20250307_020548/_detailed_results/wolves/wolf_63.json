            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, which means there is enough food available. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can secure more resources without overexerting myself, allowing for a sustainable approach to survival as the wolf population increases.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can balance my energy expenditure with the need to secure enough food while avoiding overexertion. This way, I can adapt to the changing dynamics and ensure my survival without risking too much against the other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population means competition for food is rising. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.65, I can better secure food while still being mindful of the sheep population. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexploiting the resource.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can better secure my share of the dwindling sheep population while still conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and reduce competition for the remaining sheep. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation while still contributing to the pack's survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting more challenging. With an increase in the wolf population, competition for food is higher. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's efforts. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and ensure my survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests that competition for food is rising. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of successfully catching prey while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a growing pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting more challenging. With an increase in the wolf population, competition for food will be higher. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's efforts. This balance may help ensure my survival in a time of scarcity.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can balance the need to hunt effectively while conserving energy for future hunts. This way, I can still secure enough food without overexerting myself in a potentially crowded hunting scenario.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy and avoid competition while still allowing for some hunting success.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy and avoid competition while still allowing for opportunistic hunting. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, indicating that hunting intensity needs to be adjusted to ensure sustainability. A moderate intensity of 0.50 allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's needs, balancing the risk of overhunting with the necessity of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, indicating less food availability. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, a moderate hunting intensity will help conserve energy while still allowing me to catch enough food. This balance is crucial for my survival, especially with the overall decline in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexerting myself in a situation where food is scarce. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current environment and increases my chances of survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still conserving energy. This approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity and increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a scarcity of food.
