            "I chose this theta because the current population of sheep is stable, and with the number of wolves also unchanged, a lower hunting intensity will help conserve energy and reduce competition with other wolves. This strategy allows me to survive while still ensuring that I can hunt effectively when necessary.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. With fewer wolves around, a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive in the hunt. This balance helps ensure my survival in a changing environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, but the wolf population has decreased. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still taking advantage of the available prey. This strategy allows me to survive longer in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. Given that the wolf population has decreased, I can afford to hunt at a moderate intensity to ensure my survival while still being cautious about competition from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, with the number of wolves remaining the same, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still secure food without overexerting myself. A theta of 0.65 allows me to be competitive while conserving energy for future hunts."
