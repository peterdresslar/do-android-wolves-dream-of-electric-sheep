By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the abundance of prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance will help ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a crowded environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. By increasing my intensity to 0.60, I can take advantage of the higher prey availability while still being cautious, as the wolf population remains stable. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a greater opportunity for hunting. However, with the number of wolves remaining the same, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still secure enough food without overexerting myself. A theta of 0.75 allows me to be competitive while conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because with an increasing number of wolves, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and reduce my chances of securing food. A slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, ensuring my survival in a crowded environment.",
