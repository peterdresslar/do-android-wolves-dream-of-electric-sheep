A slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt, ensuring my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased slightly, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current environment and increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can maximize my chances of catching enough prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival, especially with the current competition from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity reduces the risk of competition and allows me to conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively when necessary.",

By lowering my intensity to 0.6, I can conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, as the competition among wolves remains stable. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with more wolves than sheep, hunting at full intensity may lead to overexertion without a sufficient return. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival.",
