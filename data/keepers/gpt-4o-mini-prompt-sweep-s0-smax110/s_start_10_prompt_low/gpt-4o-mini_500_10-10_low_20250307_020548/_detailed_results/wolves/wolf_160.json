            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still contributing to the pack",

However, with the number of wolves remaining the same, I need to be cautious and not overexert myself. A theta of 0.75 allows me to hunt effectively while conserving some energy for future needs.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, which means competition for food is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, which presents a good opportunity for hunting. However, with the number of wolves remaining the same, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can secure enough food without overexerting myself or competing too aggressively with others. A theta of 0.75 allows me to hunt effectively while still conserving energy for future needs.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population means competition for food is rising. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and ensure my survival without risking depletion of resources.",
