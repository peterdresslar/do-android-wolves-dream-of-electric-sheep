            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and reduce competition for the remaining sheep. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting more challenging. By increasing my intensity to 0.65, I can improve my chances of securing food while still conserving energy, as the competition among wolves is rising.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with the number of wolves remaining the same, hunting at maximum intensity may lead to overexploitation of the remaining sheep. A lower intensity allows for a more sustainable approach, ensuring I can survive longer without depleting the food source too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, which means hunting may be less successful. By increasing my intensity slightly to 0.60, I can improve my chances of catching enough food while still conserving energy for future hunts, given the current low sheep numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, indicating a scarcity of food. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is increasing as their numbers decline. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still conserving energy and avoiding overexertion, which is crucial for my survival in a declining population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and the number of wolves has decreased significantly.
