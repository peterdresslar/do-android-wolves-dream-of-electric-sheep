            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population increasing and the number of wolves remaining the same, I can afford to hunt with slightly less intensity. This allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in securing food, as the competition among wolves is constant. A lower intensity also reduces the risk of overexertion and potential injury.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in both sheep and wolves suggests a competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the growing sheep population while still being cautious about the increased competition from other wolves. This balance helps ensure my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population increasing and the number of wolves remaining the same, a slightly reduced hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. This way, I can avoid overexertion and ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and with the recent increase in wolves, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and reduce my chances of survival. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, which means there is enough food available. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, ensuring my survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population increasing and the number of wolves remaining stable, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to balance the need for food while avoiding overexertion. This way, I can still contribute to the pack's success without risking my own survival by competing too aggressively.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, which means there is enough food available. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the current situation without overexerting myself, as other wolves are also hunting. This balance helps ensure my survival while still being cautious.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 12 wolves competing for food, a moderate intensity will allow me to hunt effectively while conserving energy. This balance increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the hunt. This strategy allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics and ensure my survival in a crowded environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with an increasing number of wolves, competition for food is rising. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success. This strategy allows me to survive longer in a challenging environment where resources are becoming scarcer.",
            "I chose this theta because with the increase in the number of wolves, competition for food is rising. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of successfully catching sheep while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a growing pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and reduce competition for the remaining sheep. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential failure. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and increase my chances of success in a more strategic manner.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making them scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and failure. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and increase my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the wolf population has increased. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population means competition for food is rising. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased slightly, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion, ensuring I remain competitive without exhausting myself too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests that competition for food will be higher. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can better secure my share of the dwindling sheep population while still conserving some energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with more wolves around, competition for food is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, allowing me to adapt to the changing environment and ensure my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, a moderate hunting intensity will help me conserve energy while still increasing my chances of catching prey. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making them scarcer. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy and avoid competition while still allowing for some hunting success.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with the wolf population remaining the same, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food without exhausting myself. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current environment and increase my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting may be less fruitful. By increasing my intensity slightly from 0.30 to 0.40, I can better compete with other wolves while still being cautious about overexerting myself in a potentially scarce environment."
