This balance allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the wolf population is also declining. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are likely to hunt at maximum intensity. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment.

This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with six wolves competing for food, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion. This way, I can still secure a meal while conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, which means there is more food available. However, with the number of wolves remaining the same, competition for that food is still present. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can take advantage of the higher sheep count while still being cautious about overexerting myself and risking injury or exhaustion.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. With the recent decrease in the wolf population, a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population increasing, there's a greater opportunity for food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can take advantage of the situation while still conserving some energy for future hunts, as the number of wolves remains stable.",
            "I chose this theta because with 26.15 sheep and 5 wolves, the competition for food is high. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance allows me to survive longer in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. By increasing my intensity to 0.75, I can take advantage of the higher availability of prey while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",

This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with an increase in the number of wolves, competition for food is rising. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting. With the number of wolves remaining stable, a higher intensity will increase my chances of securing food while still being mindful of conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because with an increasing number of wolves, competition for food is rising. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival without risking depletion of resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting.

            "I chose this theta because with the increase in the number of wolves, competition for food is rising. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in both sheep and wolves suggests a competitive environment. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance allows me to avoid overexertion and potential failure in securing food, especially with more wolves around.",
            "I chose this theta because with an increase in the wolf population, competition for food will be higher. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still allowing for a chance to catch prey.
