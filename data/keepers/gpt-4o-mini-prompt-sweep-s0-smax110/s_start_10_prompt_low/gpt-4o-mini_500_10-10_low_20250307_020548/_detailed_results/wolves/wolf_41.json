            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts. This balance increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, competition for food will be fierce. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid unnecessary risks while waiting for a better opportunity.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting more challenging. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival, especially with the rising wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with the number of wolves remaining constant, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to overexploitation of the remaining sheep. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can help ensure that there are enough sheep left for future hunts, which is crucial for my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population decreasing, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food while not overexerting myself. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy and adapt to the changing environment, especially since other wolves are also competing for the same resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, indicating that hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and increase my chances of survival in a declining prey environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, indicating a scarcity of food. Lowering my hunting intensity will help conserve energy and increase my chances of survival in a competitive environment with fewer resources. By hunting less aggressively, I can also avoid drawing attention from other wolves, who may be more desperate.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion, ensuring I have enough energy to survive while still contributing to the pack's needs.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is low and the wolf population has decreased significantly. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can strike a balance between securing enough food for survival while not overexerting myself in a dwindling prey situation. This way, I can adapt to the changing dynamics and ensure I have enough energy to survive.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low, and the wolf population has decreased significantly. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while avoiding overexertion that could lead to exhaustion or injury. This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of resources and still contribute to my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and increase my chances of survival while still contributing to the pack's needs. This approach allows me to adapt to the current situation and avoid overexertion.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the number of wolves, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves for the same prey. By choosing a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt, allowing for a better chance of survival in this challenging situation.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, but the wolf population has decreased significantly. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still taking advantage of the available prey. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, which presents a better opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition may be less intense. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while still being cautious, as the overall wolf population is still higher than the sheep."
