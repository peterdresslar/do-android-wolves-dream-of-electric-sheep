            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less viable. With more wolves around, competition for food is increasing, and a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively when necessary. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with the number of wolves remaining the same, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to overexploitation of the remaining sheep. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and ensure that I can still hunt effectively while allowing the sheep population a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, which means food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can maximize my chances of catching enough food while still being mindful of the competition from other wolves. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, indicating that hunting may be less rewarding. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still participating in the hunt. This balance may help ensure my survival as resources become scarcer.",
            "I chose this theta because the population of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. With fewer sheep available and a decrease in the wolf population, it may be wise to conserve energy and hunt less aggressively. This strategy allows me to survive longer while waiting for conditions to improve.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overhunting, ensuring I have enough energy to survive while not depleting the sheep population too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and the number of wolves has decreased significantly. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves for the limited prey. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while conserving energy. This approach allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics without overexerting myself, which is crucial for survival.",

            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still conserving energy, as the sheep population is low. This approach allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself, which is crucial for my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means food is becoming scarcer. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the number of wolves, and hunting at a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's efforts. This balance increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, while the wolf population has decreased. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can take advantage of the available prey while still being cautious, as the overall competition among wolves is lower. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",

            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, but the wolf population has decreased. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can balance the need for food while avoiding overexertion and potential danger from competing wolves. This approach allows me to adapt to the current situation and ensure my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests competition is fierce. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can take advantage of the higher sheep numbers while still being cautious about the risks posed by other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. With fewer wolves around, a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This balance helps ensure my survival in a fluctuating environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, with the recent decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still compete with others while not overexerting myself. A theta of 0.75 allows me to hunt effectively without risking too much energy.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. With fewer wolves around, I can afford to be slightly less aggressive while still ensuring I get enough food to survive. This balance helps me avoid competition with other wolves who may be hunting at maximum intensity.",
