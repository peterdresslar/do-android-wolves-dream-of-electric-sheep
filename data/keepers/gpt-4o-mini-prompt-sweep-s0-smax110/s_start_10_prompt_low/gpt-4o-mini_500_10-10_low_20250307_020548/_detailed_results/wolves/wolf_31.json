            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making them a scarcer resource. With more wolves around, hunting at a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. This strategy increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population means more competition for food. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to hunt effectively while conserving energy. This way, I can still secure food without overexerting myself, especially since the sheep population has decreased.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential failure. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and adapt to the changing environment while still contributing to the pack's survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting more challenging. By adjusting my intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This balance allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself, especially with the increasing number of wolves competing for food.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. By increasing my intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the current situation while still being cautious, as the wolf population has increased and competition for food is higher.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and reduce competition for the remaining prey. This strategy allows me to survive longer while waiting for better opportunities.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with the number of wolves remaining constant, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still find enough food without overexerting myself. A moderate increase in intensity allows me to adapt to the changing environment while still conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy while still participating in hunts. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and the number of wolves is still high. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching enough food without overexerting myself, given the current scarcity. This balanced approach helps ensure my survival while considering the competition.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can maximize my chances of securing food while still being mindful of the dwindling sheep population. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a competitive situation.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's survival. This balanced approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the declining wolf population, ensuring I remain viable in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and reduce competition with other wolves, while still allowing for some hunting to contribute to my survival. This cautious approach balances the need for food with the risks of overexertion.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while not overexerting myself, which could lead to exhaustion or injury. This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey while still being cautious of the dwindling wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, and the number of wolves is still high.
