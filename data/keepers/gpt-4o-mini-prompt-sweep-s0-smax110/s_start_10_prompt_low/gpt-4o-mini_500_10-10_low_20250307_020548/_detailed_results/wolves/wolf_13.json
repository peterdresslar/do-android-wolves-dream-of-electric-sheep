            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the increased wolf population while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that balances the risk of overexertion with the need to secure food. This way, I can still contribute to the pack's success while conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because with an increase in the wolf population, competition for food will be higher. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of catching enough food while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a growing pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By reducing my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and avoid overexerting myself while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival in a growing pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased significantly, which means competition for food will be higher. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance will help ensure my survival in a more competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased significantly, which means competition for food is higher. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success. This strategy allows me to survive longer in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the increase in the wolf population, competition for food is rising. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a potentially scarce environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, I need to increase my hunting intensity to ensure I can catch enough prey while still being mindful of the competition. A theta of 0.75 balances the need for food with the risk of overexertion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt, ensuring my survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making them a more valuable resource. With more wolves around, I need to increase my hunting intensity to ensure I can secure enough food for survival. A theta of 0.75 balances the need for increased effort while still conserving some energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential failure. A slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, adapting to the current situation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less viable. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and reduce competition for limited prey. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with more wolves around, competition for food is increasing. By raising my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of successfully catching prey while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a changing environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to overexploitation of the remaining sheep. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can help ensure that there are enough sheep left for future hunts while still contributing to my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can better compete for food while still conserving energy, as the overall number of sheep is low. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the overall wolf population is also declining. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and increase my chances of survival in a challenging environment. This approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey while still participating in the hunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's survival. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the declining wolf population."
