            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep and wolves is stable, and hunting at maximum intensity may lead to competition with other wolves for the same prey. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid unnecessary conflict, increasing my chances of survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition is less intense, allowing me to hunt at a moderate intensity without risking overexertion or attracting too much attention from other wolves. A theta of 0.50 balances the need for food with the need for caution."
