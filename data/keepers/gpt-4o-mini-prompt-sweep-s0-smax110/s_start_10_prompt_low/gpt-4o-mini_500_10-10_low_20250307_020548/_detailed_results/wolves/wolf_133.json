            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, and the number of wolves is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still contributing to the pack's overall success. A moderate intensity allows me to adapt to the changing environment and ensure my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with the number of wolves remaining stable, I can afford to increase my hunting intensity slightly without overexerting myself. This way, I can still contribute to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can better secure my share of the dwindling sheep population while still conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because with the increase in the wolf population, competition for food is likely to intensify. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can better secure food while still conserving energy, as the sheep population has decreased. This balance will help ensure my survival in a more competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. This strategy increases my chances of survival by avoiding overexertion in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly to 0.60, I can take advantage of the current situation while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a potentially dwindling environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With an increase in the wolf population, competition for food will be higher.
