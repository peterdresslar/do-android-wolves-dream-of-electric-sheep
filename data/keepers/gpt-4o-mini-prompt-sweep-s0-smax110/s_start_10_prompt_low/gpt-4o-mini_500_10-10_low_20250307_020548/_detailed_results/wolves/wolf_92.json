This approach allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself, ensuring my survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the number of wolves, which suggests competition for food is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still allowing for the possibility of catching prey. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
