            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. This strategy helps ensure my survival by avoiding overexertion in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy while still allowing for opportunistic hunting. This balance increases my chances of survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance my energy expenditure with the need to secure enough food without overexerting myself, especially since the sheep population has decreased.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less viable. With more wolves around, the competition for food is increasing, and a lower intensity will help conserve energy while still allowing me to hunt opportunistically. This way, I can adapt to the changing environment and ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure enough food while conserving energy and avoiding overexertion. This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics of the pack and the declining sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, I need to increase my hunting intensity to compete effectively for the limited resources. A theta of 0.70 allows me to balance the need for food while conserving some energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting more challenging. By reducing my intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still participating in hunts, allowing me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey. This approach balances my need for food with the risk of overexertion in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting might be more challenging. By increasing my intensity slightly from 0.65 to 0.75, I can maximize my chances of a successful hunt while still conserving energy for future needs. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid drawing attention while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This balanced approach increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the number of wolves, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves for limited resources. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid unnecessary confrontations, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still being cautious, as overexerting myself could lead to competition with other wolves and potential failure in securing a meal.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the wolf population is still high. A lower hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overhunting, which could lead to further depletion of resources. This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the current situation while still being cautious.",
            "I chose this theta because the population of sheep is decreasing, and with fewer sheep available, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves for limited resources. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment.
