By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of catching enough prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a growing wolf population.",

By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid unnecessary confrontations, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, indicating a good opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests competition is high, and I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food without exhausting myself or risking injury.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, but the wolf population has decreased. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still taking advantage of the available prey. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a fluctuating environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself.
