            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and reduce competition for the remaining sheep. This way, I can still hunt effectively without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching enough food while still being cautious, as the wolf population remains high and competition for resources is fierce.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with the number of wolves remaining the same, hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's survival, especially as resources are dwindling.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with the number of wolves remaining the same, competition for food is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise. This strategy may help me survive longer in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while conserving energy. This way, I can still contribute to my survival without overexerting myself, especially since other wolves are also competing for the same resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolf populations indicates a need for a more balanced approach to hunting. By increasing my intensity to 0.50, I can contribute to the pack's survival while still being cautious, as overhunting could lead to further declines in prey and competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. With more wolves than sheep, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and overexploitation of the remaining sheep. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the wolf population is still relatively high. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to catch enough food to survive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is increasing, which presents a good opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition is high, and I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food without overexerting myself and risking injury or exhaustion. A theta of 0.50 allows me to be effective while also being cautious.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the number of wolves, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves for the same prey. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition, increasing my chances of survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. Given the recent decrease in the wolf population, a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive in the hunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, but the wolf population has decreased. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still taking advantage of the available prey. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting. However, with the number of wolves decreasing, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can catch enough food without overexerting myself. A theta of 0.50 allows me to hunt effectively while conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, while the wolf population has decreased. This suggests that hunting at maximum intensity may lead to competition with other wolves, risking overhunting and potential starvation. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and adapt to the changing environment, ensuring my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests competition is fierce. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while conserving energy and avoiding overexertion in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased while the wolf population has decreased. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and reduce competition with other wolves, allowing me to survive longer while still taking advantage of the available prey.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, indicating more food availability. However, with the number of wolves remaining the same, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough prey without exhausting myself or competing too aggressively with other wolves. A moderate intensity allows me to be efficient while also conserving energy.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with fewer wolves around, I can afford to hunt at a lower intensity. This will help conserve energy and reduce competition with other wolves, allowing me to survive longer without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing more food resources.
