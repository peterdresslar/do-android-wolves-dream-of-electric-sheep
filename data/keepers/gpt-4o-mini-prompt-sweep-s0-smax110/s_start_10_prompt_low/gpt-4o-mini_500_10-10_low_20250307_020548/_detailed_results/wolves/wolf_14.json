By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can better secure my share of the sheep while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a growing pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and overexertion without guaranteed success. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. However, the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving some energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the increase in the wolf population means competition for food is higher. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",

By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy, as I don",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are likely to hunt at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to survive longer in a challenging environment.",

By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can better position myself to catch enough food while still being mindful of the increased wolf population. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
