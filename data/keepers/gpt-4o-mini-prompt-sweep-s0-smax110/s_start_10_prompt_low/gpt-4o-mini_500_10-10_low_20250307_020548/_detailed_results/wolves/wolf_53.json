            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are likely to hunt at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to survive longer while waiting for a more favorable hunting opportunity.",

By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey without overexerting myself, as the competition among wolves is rising. This balance helps ensure my survival while being mindful of the limited resources.",
