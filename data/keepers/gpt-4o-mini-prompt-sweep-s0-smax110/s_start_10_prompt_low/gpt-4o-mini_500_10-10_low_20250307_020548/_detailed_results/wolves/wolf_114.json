            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with the number of wolves remaining the same, hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt, ensuring my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with 34 wolves competing for food, hunting at maximum intensity may lead to overexertion and wasted energy. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still conserving energy, as the competition among wolves is high. This approach allows me to adapt to the current situation and improve my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the competition among wolves is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival while still contributing to the pack's overall success.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while conserving energy, as the sheep population is still relatively high. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",

This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, which means there is more food available. However, since the number of wolves has remained the same, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough prey without exhausting myself or competing too aggressively with other wolves. A slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. By increasing my intensity to 0.75, I can take advantage of the larger prey population while still conserving some energy for future hunts, ensuring my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with a stable number of wolves and an increase in sheep, it makes sense to hunt at a slightly reduced intensity. This allows me to conserve energy while still taking advantage of the available prey. A lower intensity also reduces the risk of competition with other wolves, as they may be hunting at maximum intensity.",
