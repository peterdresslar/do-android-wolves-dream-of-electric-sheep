            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding.

This strategy increases my chances of survival by avoiding competition for scarce resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and with the wolves remaining constant, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still increasing my chances of catching prey. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting may be more challenging. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can maximize my chances of securing food while still being mindful of the competition with other wolves. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with the wolf population remaining stable, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to overexploitation of the remaining sheep. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and ensure that I have enough resources for future hunts while still contributing to the pack's survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With the number of wolves remaining the same, a lower intensity will help conserve energy while still allowing for some hunting success. This strategy increases my chances of survival by avoiding competition with other wolves who may be hunting at maximum intensity.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high with their numbers also declining. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
