            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, I need to increase my hunting intensity to compete effectively for the limited resources. A theta of 0.60 allows me to balance the need for food while conserving some energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the wolf population is increasing. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves for dwindling prey. This strategy allows me to survive longer while waiting for the sheep population to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of securing enough food while still conserving energy. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to catch enough food to survive.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to wasted energy and increased competition with other wolves. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's survival, allowing for a more sustainable approach given the current circumstances.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low, and the wolf population has decreased significantly. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
