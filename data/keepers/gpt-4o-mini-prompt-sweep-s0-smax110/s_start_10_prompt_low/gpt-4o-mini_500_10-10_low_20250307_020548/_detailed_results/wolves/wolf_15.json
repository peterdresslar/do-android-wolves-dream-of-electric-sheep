            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, which means there is enough food to go around. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still contributing to the hunt. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still significantly higher than the number of wolves, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that balances my need for food with the risk of overexertion. By increasing my intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the growing wolf population while still being cautious.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival without risking depletion of resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the wolf population, allowing for a more moderate hunting intensity. By increasing my theta to 0.70, I can take advantage of the current sheep abundance while still conserving energy for future hunts, especially since the wolf population is increasing.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. With an increase in the wolf population, hunting at maximum intensity may lead to competition and overexploitation of the remaining sheep. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves while still contributing to the hunt when necessary.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. However, the wolf population has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.65, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and reduce competition for the remaining sheep. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the increase in the wolf population, competition for food is rising. By increasing my hunting intensity, I can better secure my share of the dwindling sheep population while still being mindful of the risks of overexertion. A moderate increase to 0.65 allows me to balance the need for food with the need to conserve energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, competition for food is increasing, so a moderate intensity will help me conserve energy while still being effective in hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and reduce competition for dwindling resources. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation while still ensuring my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and hunting at maximum intensity may lead to overexploitation of the remaining sheep. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can help ensure that there are enough sheep for future hunts while also conserving energy for myself. This approach balances my immediate needs with long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with the number of wolves remaining the same, hunting at maximum intensity may lead to competition and overexploitation of the remaining sheep. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt, ensuring my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to wasted energy and increased competition with other wolves. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while conserving energy. This approach allows me to adapt to the declining prey availability without overexerting myself, ensuring my survival in a competitive situation."
