            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By lowering my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being effective in hunting. This balance helps ensure my survival in a more competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves in the area, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy while still allowing for opportunistic hunting. This balance increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting more challenging. By increasing my intensity slightly to 0.55, I can improve my chances of catching prey without overexerting myself, given the increased competition from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid competition while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population decreasing and the number of wolves remaining constant, hunting at a slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's survival. It also reduces competition with other wolves who may be hunting at maximum intensity.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the wolf population is still high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while being cautious not to overexert myself, which could lead to exhaustion or injury. This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity while still contributing to my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the competition among wolves is high with their population also declining. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food while conserving energy. A moderate intensity allows me to adapt to the decreasing wolf population and avoid overexertion, which could be detrimental if the trend continues.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of securing food while still being cautious, as overexerting myself could lead to exhaustion or injury. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging situation.",

By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's survival.

            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while conserving energy, as the sheep population is low and hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. This approach allows me to adapt to the current situation and ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, but the wolf population has decreased significantly.
