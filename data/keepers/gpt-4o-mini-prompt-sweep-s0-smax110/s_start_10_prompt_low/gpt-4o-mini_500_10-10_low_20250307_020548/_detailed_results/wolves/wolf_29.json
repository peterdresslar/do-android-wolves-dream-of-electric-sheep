            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means food is becoming scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential failure. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less predictable. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts. This balance increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself in a potentially scarce environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the increase in the wolf population means competition for food is higher. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, allowing me to survive longer in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and risk of failure. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, which means competition for food is high among wolves. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of securing enough food while still being cautious about overexerting myself in a potentially scarce environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with the number of wolves remaining the same, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still find food without overexerting myself. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, which means food is scarcer. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and increases my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, indicating a scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of catching enough prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a declining wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still allowing for a chance to catch prey without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to wasted energy and increased competition with other wolves. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and the number of wolves has also decreased significantly. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still increasing my chances of catching prey. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to wasted energy and increased competition with other wolves. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves suggests that resources are becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while also conserving energy, as hunting at maximum intensity may lead to competition with other wolves and potential exhaustion."
