By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting may be less fruitful. By increasing my intensity slightly from my previous theta, I can take advantage of the remaining sheep while still being cautious about overexerting myself in a potentially scarce environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and overexploitation of the remaining sheep. By reducing my intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and avoid drawing attention while still contributing to the hunt when necessary.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population decreasing, I need to increase my hunting intensity to ensure I can secure enough food for survival. However, I also want to be cautious not to overexert myself, as the wolf population remains stable. A moderate increase to 0.60 allows me to adapt to the changing conditions while still conserving energy.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the increase in wolves means competition for food is higher. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",

This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",

A theta of 0.75 allows me to be more efficient in my hunting without overexerting myself, especially since other wolves are also competing for the same resources.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population decreasing and the number of wolves remaining stable, a slightly lower hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself when resources are limited.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, indicating that hunting may be more challenging. By increasing my hunting intensity from 0.60 to 0.75, I can better compete with other wolves while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance will help ensure my survival as resources become scarcer.",
