            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and reduce competition for the remaining sheep. This way, I can ensure my survival while still contributing to the pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and avoid competition while still allowing for some hunting opportunities.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, indicating that hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and resources while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with the wolf population remaining the same, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still find enough food without overexerting myself. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and the number of wolves is still high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while conserving energy and avoiding overexertion, which is crucial for my survival in a declining population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low and the wolf population has decreased. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is high. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's survival. This balance may help ensure I can hunt effectively without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the competition among wolves is high with a significant drop in their population. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's survival. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the increased competition.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, and with fewer sheep, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves for limited resources. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's survival, ensuring I have enough strength for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can take advantage of the dwindling sheep population while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a challenging situation.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the competition among wolves is high with their population also declining. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the wolf population, and hunting at a lower intensity may help me conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's survival. With other wolves hunting at maximum intensity, there's a risk of overhunting, which could lead to food scarcity. A moderate approach allows me to adapt to the current situation and ensure my own survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, and the wolf population has decreased. A moderate hunting intensity allows me to balance the need for food while being cautious about competition from other wolves. This way, I can secure enough resources without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, but the wolf population has decreased significantly. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who may be hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to survive longer while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, and the wolf population has decreased. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can balance the need for food while minimizing the risk of overexertion and competition with other wolves. This approach allows me to adapt to the current dynamics and ensure my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, but the wolf population has decreased. This suggests that there may be less competition for food, allowing me to hunt at a lower intensity while still being effective. A lower theta will help conserve energy and reduce the risk of injury while hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. With the recent decrease in the wolf population, it's important to balance my hunting intensity to ensure my survival while still being effective in securing food. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid unnecessary risks.",
