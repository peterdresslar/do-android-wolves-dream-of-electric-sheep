            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, which means hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased slightly, indicating that hunting might be less rewarding. By increasing my intensity from 0.25 to 0.40, I can still contribute to the pack's success while conserving energy and minimizing risk. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population decreasing, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food while not overexerting myself. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy and adapt to the changing environment, especially since the number of wolves remains constant.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting may be less fruitful. By reducing my intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, allowing me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population decreasing, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food while not overexerting myself. A slightly higher intensity than before allows me to adapt to the changing environment and compete effectively with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy while still participating in hunts. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and increases my chances of survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting might be less successful. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased slightly, indicating that hunting may be less fruitful if I go all out. By increasing my intensity from 0.40 to 0.50, I can balance the need to hunt effectively while conserving energy for future hunts, especially since the wolf population remains stable.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a lower availability of food. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt if necessary. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity. This balance helps ensure my survival while also considering the recent decrease in the wolf population, which suggests that overexerting myself could lead to unnecessary risks.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, but the wolf population has decreased. This suggests that hunting at a lower intensity may allow me to conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still taking advantage of the available prey. A more cautious approach will help ensure my survival in this changing environment."
