However, with the number of wolves remaining the same, I need to be cautious and not overexert myself. A theta of 0.65 allows me to hunt effectively while conserving some energy in case competition arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, with the recent decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still compete effectively while also conserving energy for future hunts.",

With the number of wolves remaining the same, a slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive in the hunt. This balance helps ensure my survival in a stable environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition is tougher. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can take advantage of the abundant prey while still being cautious about the risks posed by fewer wolves around.",
