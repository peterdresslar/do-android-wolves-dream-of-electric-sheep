            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, and the number of wolves is increasing. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves for limited prey. This strategy allows me to survive longer while waiting for a more favorable situation.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and less food for me. By choosing a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success, ensuring my survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of catching enough sheep while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a growing pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the wolf population has increased. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, which means food is scarcer. With an increase in the wolf population, competition for food will be higher. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of successfully catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making it less viable to hunt at maximum intensity. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's hunting efforts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the wolf population is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to hunt effectively while conserving energy, as the overall wolf population remains unchanged. This approach allows me to adapt to the current situation and improve my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can maximize my chances of securing enough food while still being cautious about overexerting myself, given the stable wolf population. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a more competitive environment. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's efforts. This balance may help ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a time of scarcity.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's survival. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and ensures I remain strong for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while conserving energy. This approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity and avoid competing too aggressively with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the wolf population is also declining. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who may be hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is increasing. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance may help ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the wolf population is still high.

This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment.
