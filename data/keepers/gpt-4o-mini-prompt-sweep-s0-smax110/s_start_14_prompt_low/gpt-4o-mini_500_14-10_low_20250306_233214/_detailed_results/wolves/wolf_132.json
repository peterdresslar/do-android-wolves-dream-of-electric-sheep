With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts. This strategy increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the wolf population is increasing. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt. This balance allows me to survive longer in a competitive environment where resources are becoming scarcer.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.65, I can improve my chances of catching enough prey while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a more competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy while still allowing for some hunting. This balance increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the number of wolves has increased. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves for the dwindling sheep population. This strategy allows me to survive longer while waiting for a better opportunity.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, which means there is more food available.
