A theta of 0.75 allows me to be aggressive enough to catch prey without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and less food for everyone. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition while still contributing to the pack's success.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and wait for better opportunities while still participating in the hunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and with 19 wolves competing for food, a moderate hunting intensity will allow me to secure enough resources while avoiding overexertion. This balance helps ensure my survival without risking depletion of the sheep population too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased slightly, indicating that hunting may be becoming more challenging.
