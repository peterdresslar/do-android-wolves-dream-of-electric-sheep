            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the wolf population has increased. A lower hunting intensity will help conserve energy and resources while still allowing for some hunting. This strategy may help me survive in a competitive environment where resources are becoming scarcer.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting more challenging. With an increase in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still secure enough food without exhausting myself or attracting too much competition. A moderate increase in intensity allows me to adapt to the current situation while still conserving energy.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt, ensuring my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy. This balance is crucial for my survival as the wolf population is increasing.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and the number of wolves has increased. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This balance will help ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
