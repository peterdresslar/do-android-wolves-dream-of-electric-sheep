            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means hunting is becoming more challenging. By increasing my intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of a successful hunt without overexerting myself, especially since the number of wolves is increasing. This balance helps ensure my survival while being mindful of the competition.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and with 20 wolves, hunting at a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy and avoid competition while still allowing for some hunting. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 21 wolves, competition for food is moderate. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while conserving energy, as the risk of overexertion is high with so many wolves around. This approach allows me to adapt to the current situation without exhausting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means food is becoming scarcer. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competing too aggressively with other wolves. This strategy allows me to survive longer while waiting for the sheep population to stabilize or increase.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting may be less successful if I go all out. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive with other wolves. This balance increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased slightly, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to hunt effectively while conserving energy, as the competition with other wolves remains constant. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are likely hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with 35 sheep and 22 wolves, the competition for food is still significant. Increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60 allows me to be more aggressive in securing food while still conserving some energy, as the sheep population is not too low. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
