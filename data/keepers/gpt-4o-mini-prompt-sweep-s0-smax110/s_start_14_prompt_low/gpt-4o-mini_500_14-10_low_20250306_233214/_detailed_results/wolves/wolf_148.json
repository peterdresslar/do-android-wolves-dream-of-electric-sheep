By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still contributing to the pack's survival. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and ensure my own survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and I want to balance my hunting efforts to ensure I can still catch enough food while conserving energy. A moderate intensity allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself, especially since the number of wolves hasn",

A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival.",

A theta of 0.40 allows me to be more competitive without overexerting myself, ensuring I can still survive while taking advantage of the current situation.",
