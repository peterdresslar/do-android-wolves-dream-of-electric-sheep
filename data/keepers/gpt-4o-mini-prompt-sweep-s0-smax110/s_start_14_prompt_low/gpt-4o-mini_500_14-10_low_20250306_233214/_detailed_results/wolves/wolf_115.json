            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can balance the need to secure food while conserving energy and avoiding overexertion. This strategy allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics without risking my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can secure enough food while avoiding overexertion. A slight increase in intensity will help me compete better without risking depletion of resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased slightly, and the number of wolves has remained the same. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased significantly, which means competition for food is higher. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when necessary. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a more competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population increasing and the number of wolves remaining stable, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to balance my need for food while avoiding overexertion. This way, I can still compete effectively without risking my energy reserves too much.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population means more competition for food. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion, allowing me to survive longer in a situation where resources are becoming scarcer. This strategy also helps me avoid attracting attention from other wolves who might be hunting at maximum intensity.",
