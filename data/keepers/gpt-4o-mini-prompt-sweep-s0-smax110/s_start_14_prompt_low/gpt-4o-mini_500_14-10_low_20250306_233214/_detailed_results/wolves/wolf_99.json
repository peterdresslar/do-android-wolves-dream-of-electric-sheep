            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and less food for everyone. By lowering my intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and still have a chance to catch prey while avoiding direct competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and reduce the risk of overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and ensure my survival without competing too aggressively with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can improve my chances of catching enough food while still conserving energy. This balance is crucial for my survival, especially with the number of wolves remaining constant.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By lowering my intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This approach allows me to adapt to the current situation and increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can maximize my chances of catching enough food while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival, especially with the wolf population remaining stable.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's efforts. This balance may help ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, indicating a potential for more food. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition is fierce. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.40, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when necessary. This balance will help ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the wolf population is also declining. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
