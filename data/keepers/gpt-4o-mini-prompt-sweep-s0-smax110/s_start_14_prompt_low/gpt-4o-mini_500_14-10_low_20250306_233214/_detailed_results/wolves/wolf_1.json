            "I chose this theta because with 14 sheep and 10 wolves, the competition for food is high. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving some energy. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a situation where resources are limited.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased slightly, but the number of wolves has decreased. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still contributing to the hunt. This balance helps ensure my survival in a changing environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and hunting at a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. This strategy reduces the risk of overexertion and potential injury, ensuring my survival in a competitive environment."
