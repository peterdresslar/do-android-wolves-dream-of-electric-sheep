            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the wolf population has increased. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still contributing to the pack's success. This strategy allows me to survive longer in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with the number of wolves remaining stable, I can afford to increase my hunting intensity slightly. This will allow me to take advantage of the available prey while still conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexerting myself. This way, I can still contribute to my survival while being mindful of the overall situation.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating that hunting may be more challenging. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of securing food while still being cautious about overexerting myself in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can maximize my chances of securing a meal while still being mindful of the competition from other wolves. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting intensity may need to be moderated to ensure sustainability. By reducing my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still contributing to the pack's needs.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and I need to increase my hunting intensity to secure enough food for survival. With the number of wolves remaining constant, I must compete more aggressively for resources, but I also want to avoid overexertion that could lead to exhaustion.",
