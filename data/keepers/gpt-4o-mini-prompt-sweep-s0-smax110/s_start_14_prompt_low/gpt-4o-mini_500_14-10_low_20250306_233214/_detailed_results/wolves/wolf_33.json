By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition, while still contributing to the pack's success.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting more competitive. With an increase in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still secure enough food without exhausting myself.

            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the increase in wolves means competition for food is higher. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population decreasing, I need to increase my hunting intensity to secure enough food for survival. However, I must be cautious not to overexert myself, as the number of wolves remains high, and competition for food will be fierce. A theta of 0.65 strikes a balance between maximizing my hunting efforts and conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With fewer sheep available, a lower intensity will conserve energy and reduce competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in the long run.",

This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low, and the recent decrease in both sheep and wolves suggests that hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves for limited resources. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's survival. This strategy may also help me stay under the radar of other wolves who are more aggressively hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the population of sheep is decreasing, and the number of wolves is also declining.
