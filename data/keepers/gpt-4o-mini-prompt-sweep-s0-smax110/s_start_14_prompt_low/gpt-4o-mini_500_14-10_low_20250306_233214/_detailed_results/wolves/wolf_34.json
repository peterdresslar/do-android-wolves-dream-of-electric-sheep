            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the wolf population is increasing. A lower hunting intensity will help conserve energy and resources while still allowing for some hunting, as competition among wolves is likely to be fierce. This strategy balances the need to hunt with the risk of overexertion in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, I need to increase my hunting intensity to ensure I can secure enough food for survival. A theta of 0.60 balances the need for increased effort while still conserving some energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with more wolves around, competition for food is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making them a scarcer resource. Increasing my hunting intensity slightly to 0.60 allows me to be more competitive against other wolves while still conserving energy. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, competition for food is higher, and a lower intensity will help conserve energy while still allowing for opportunistic hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, which means hunting may be less fruitful. By increasing my intensity slightly to 0.60, I can maximize my chances of capturing enough food while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can improve my chances of securing enough food while still being mindful of the competition from other wolves. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the wolf population is also declining. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's survival. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the declining wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to overexploitation of the remaining prey. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and increase my chances of survival while still contributing to the pack's needs. This cautious approach allows me to adapt to the declining prey and wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still conserving energy and avoiding overexertion. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the declining wolf population.",

            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment.

By choosing a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still increasing my chances of a successful hunt without attracting too much attention from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, but the wolf population has decreased significantly. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still taking advantage of the available prey. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
