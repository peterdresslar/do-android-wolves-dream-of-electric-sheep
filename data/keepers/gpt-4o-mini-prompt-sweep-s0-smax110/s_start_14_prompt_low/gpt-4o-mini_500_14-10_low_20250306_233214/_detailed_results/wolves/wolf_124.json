            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition is high, and I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food without exhausting myself or drawing too much attention from other wolves. A theta of 0.60 allows me to be more efficient while still being cautious.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased slightly, indicating that hunting conditions may be becoming more challenging.
