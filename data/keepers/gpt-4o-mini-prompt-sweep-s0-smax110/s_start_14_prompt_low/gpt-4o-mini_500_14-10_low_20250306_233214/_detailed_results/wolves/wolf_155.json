            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By lowering my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 12 wolves competing for food, a slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This balance increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because with a stable number of wolves and an increase in sheep, I can afford to hunt with less intensity. This allows me to conserve energy while still taking advantage of the available prey. A lower intensity also reduces competition with other wolves, as they are likely to continue hunting at maximum intensity.",
