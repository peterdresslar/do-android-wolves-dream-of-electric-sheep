By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can maximize my chances of securing food while still being mindful of the risks posed by other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts. This strategy increases my chances of survival by avoiding competition with other wolves for the limited sheep.",

This will help me secure enough food while still being cautious, as the competition among wolves is present.",
