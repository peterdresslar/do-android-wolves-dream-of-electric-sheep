            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. By lowering my intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, especially since the number of wolves has remained constant. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and wasted energy. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. By increasing my intensity to 0.60, I can take advantage of the higher prey availability while still conserving energy compared to maximum intensity. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased slightly, while the number of wolves has increased. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves for the limited sheep available. This strategy allows me to survive longer while waiting for a more favorable situation.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. By increasing my intensity slightly from my previous theta, I can take advantage of the current situation while still conserving energy in case the competition among wolves increases.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can better secure my share of the sheep while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the wolf population is increasing. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively when necessary. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the increase in the wolf population and the decrease in sheep, hunting at a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. This strategy helps ensure my survival by reducing competition for resources and allowing me to adapt to the changing dynamics of the pack.",
