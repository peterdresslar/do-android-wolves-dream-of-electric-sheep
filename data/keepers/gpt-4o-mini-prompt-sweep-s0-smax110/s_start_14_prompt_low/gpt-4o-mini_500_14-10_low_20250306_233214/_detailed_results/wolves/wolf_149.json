            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential failure. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making them scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at a higher intensity increases my chances of securing food while still being mindful of the competition. A theta of 0.60 allows me to balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and reduce competition for the remaining sheep. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and with the number of wolves remaining stable, I can afford to increase my hunting intensity slightly. This will help me secure more food while still being mindful of the competition from other wolves. A theta of 0.55 balances the need for survival with the risk of overexertion.",
            "I chose this theta because with the increase in the wolf population and a decrease in sheep, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves for limited resources. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's needs.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased slightly, which presents a good opportunity for hunting. By increasing my intensity to 0.55, I can take advantage of the higher prey availability while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that food is becoming scarcer. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means hunting intensity should be adjusted to ensure sustainability. By increasing my intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the current situation without overexerting myself, allowing for a balance between hunting and survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting may be less fruitful. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy while still participating in hunting when opportunities arise. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, which means food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching enough food while still conserving energy, as the overall wolf population remains stable. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 35.16, and I want to increase my chances of a successful hunt without overexerting myself. By raising my intensity from 0.60 to 0.75, I can balance the need for food with the risk of depleting resources too quickly, especially since the number of wolves remains constant.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with an increase in the wolf population, competition for food will be higher. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise. This strategy allows me to adapt to the changing environment and increases my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can maximize my chances of securing enough food while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival, especially with the current competition from other wolves.",
