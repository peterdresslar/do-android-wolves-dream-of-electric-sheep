            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased slightly, indicating a potential for more food. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests competition is fierce. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can take advantage of the available prey while still being cautious, as overexerting myself could lead to unnecessary risks.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who may be hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and increases my chances of survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests competition is fierce. By increasing my intensity to 0.60, I can take advantage of the available prey while still being cautious about the risks of overexertion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and with 16 wolves competing for food, a moderate increase in hunting intensity will help me secure enough resources without overexerting myself. This way, I can balance my energy expenditure with the need to hunt effectively.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to ensure sustainability. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack"
