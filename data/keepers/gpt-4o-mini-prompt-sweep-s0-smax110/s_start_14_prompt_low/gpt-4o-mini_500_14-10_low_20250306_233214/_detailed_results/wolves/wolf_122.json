            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, indicating that hunting may be less fruitful. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being ready to hunt if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of securing enough food while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive landscape with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting might be more challenging. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can improve my chances of catching enough food while still conserving energy for future hunts, as the overall wolf population remains stable.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the number of wolves, and hunting at a lower intensity will help conserve energy while still allowing for some success. This approach minimizes the risk of overexertion and potential failure, which is crucial given the recent decline in both sheep and wolf populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and hunting at a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's survival. With the recent decrease in both sheep and wolves, a more cautious approach will help ensure I can continue to hunt effectively without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in the wolf population suggests increased competition for food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can better secure food while still being cautious not to overexert myself, given the recent decline in my pack"
