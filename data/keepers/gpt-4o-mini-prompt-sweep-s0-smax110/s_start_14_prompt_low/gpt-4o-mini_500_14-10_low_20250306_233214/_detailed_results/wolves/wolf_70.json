            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, it's wise to conserve energy and avoid competition. A lower intensity will help me survive while still allowing for opportunistic hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy, as the competition with other wolves remains constant.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can maximize my chances of securing food while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival, especially with the current population of wolves remaining stable.",
