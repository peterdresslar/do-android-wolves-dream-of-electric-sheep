            "I chose this theta because with 14 sheep and 10 wolves, the competition for food is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",

However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition is less intense, allowing me to hunt at a moderate intensity without risking overexertion or attracting too much attention from other wolves. A theta of 0.50 balances the need for food with the caution required in a changing environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, which means competition for food is fierce. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, with the decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food without overexerting myself and risking injury or exhaustion. A moderate intensity allows me to be efficient while also being cautious."
