            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the number of wolves. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing more opportunities for hunting. However, with the number of wolves remaining the same, I need to be cautious and not overexert myself. A slightly higher intensity than before allows me to take advantage of the increased prey while still conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.30, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success. This strategy allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics and ensures my survival without risking depletion of resources.",
            "I chose this theta because with 48 sheep and 15 wolves, the competition for food is moderate. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while conserving energy. This approach allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself, as the other wolves are also hunting at maximum intensity.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a more competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and with more wolves around, competition for food will be fierce. A slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, and the number of wolves is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still contributing to the pack's success. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population decreasing, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food while not exhausting myself. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy and adapt to the changing environment, especially since other wolves are also competing for the same resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, I need to increase my hunting intensity to compete effectively for the limited resources.
