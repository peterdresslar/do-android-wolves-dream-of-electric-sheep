A moderate intensity of 0.50 allows me to hunt effectively while conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and I want to conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively. A lower intensity allows me to avoid competition with other wolves and increases my chances of survival by not overexerting myself in a potentially risky situation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. With fewer wolves around, a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive in the hunt. This balance helps ensure my survival in a changing environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, but the wolf population has decreased. This suggests that hunting at maximum intensity may lead to competition with other wolves, which could be detrimental to my survival. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still taking advantage of the available prey without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. With fewer wolves around, a moderate intensity allows me to balance my energy expenditure while still being competitive in securing food. This way, I can ensure my survival without risking too much energy in a potentially scarce environment.",
