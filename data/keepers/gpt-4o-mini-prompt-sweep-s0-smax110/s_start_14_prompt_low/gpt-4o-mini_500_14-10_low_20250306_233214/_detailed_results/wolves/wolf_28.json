            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts. This way, I can adapt to the changing environment and ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid overexerting myself while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the increase in the wolf population means competition for food is rising. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of securing food while still conserving energy for future hunts, as I don't want to overexert myself in a potentially scarce environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy while still allowing for some hunting opportunities. This balance increases my chances of survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of catching sheep while still conserving some energy for future hunts, balancing the need for survival with the risk of overexertion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with more wolves around, competition for food is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's efforts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less favorable. With more wolves and fewer sheep, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still allowing for opportunistic hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, I need to balance my hunting intensity to avoid competition while still ensuring I can catch enough prey. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy and adapt to the changing environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, which means food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can maximize my chances of catching enough food while still being cautious about overexerting myself in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with the number of wolves remaining the same, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to overexploitation of the remaining sheep. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolf populations indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can better compete for resources while still conserving energy compared to maximum intensity. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a declining situation.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the wolf population is still high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still being cautious, as overhunting could lead to further depletion of resources and competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the population of sheep is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and I need to increase my hunting intensity to secure enough food for survival. However, I must balance this with the risk of overhunting, which could lead to a further decline in sheep and ultimately harm my own survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is increasing. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the wolf population, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves for limited resources. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the number of wolves, which increases competition for food. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition is less intense.
