            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By reducing my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively. This balance will help ensure my survival in a more competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making hunting less predictable. With more wolves around, a lower intensity may help me conserve energy while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By raising my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can increase my chances of successfully catching prey while still conserving some energy. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and failure. A slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the increase in wolves means competition for food is higher. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population decreasing, I need to increase my hunting intensity to secure enough food for survival. However, I also want to avoid overexertion and risk attracting attention from other wolves. A theta of 0.60 strikes a balance between ensuring I get enough food while still being cautious.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy while still participating in hunts when opportunities arise. This strategy balances my need for survival with the current prey availability.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a challenging situation.",
