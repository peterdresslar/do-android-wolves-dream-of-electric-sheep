            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, and the number of wolves is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still contributing to the pack's success. A lower theta allows me to be strategic and wait for better opportunities.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts. This strategy helps ensure my survival by avoiding overexertion in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and less food for everyone. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can better secure my share of the dwindling sheep population while still conserving some energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy while still allowing me to hunt effectively. This balance increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with more wolves around, competition for food will be fierce. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and the number of wolves has increased. By adjusting my hunting intensity to a moderate level, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, indicating a scarcity of food. With more wolves than sheep, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential failure. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and adapt to the current situation, ensuring my survival while still contributing to the pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, indicating a scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still conserving energy, as the competition with other wolves remains high. This way, I can adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, which means there are fewer prey available. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and increases my chances of survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the wolf population is also declining. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still conserving energy, as hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable given the current prey availability. This approach allows me to adapt to the changing environment and increase my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's survival. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the declining wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion, allowing me to adapt to the current scarcity while still being cautious.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, who may be hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and increase my chances of survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high compared to the decreased wolf population. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while also being cautious, as the overall trend shows a decline in wolves. This approach allows me to contribute to the pack's survival without overexerting myself in a potentially competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the wolf population is also declining. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and resources while still contributing to the pack's survival. This approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity and avoid overexertion, which is crucial for my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can strike a balance between conserving energy and increasing my chances of catching prey without overexerting myself in a competitive situation.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low, and with the decrease in the wolf population, hunting at a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively.
