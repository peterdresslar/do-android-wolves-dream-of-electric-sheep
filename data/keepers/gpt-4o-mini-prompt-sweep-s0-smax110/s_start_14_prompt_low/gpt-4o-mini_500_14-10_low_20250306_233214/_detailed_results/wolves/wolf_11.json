            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food without overexerting myself. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive with the other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the current sheep population while still being cautious, as the recent increase in wolves could lead to competition for food.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival in a growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity. By increasing my theta to 0.70, I can take advantage of the sheep population while still conserving energy for future hunts, especially since the wolf population is increasing and competition for food may rise.",
            "I chose this theta because the population of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By reducing my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because with an increase in the wolf population, competition for food is becoming fiercer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can better secure my share of the sheep while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance will help ensure my survival in a growing pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and reduce the risk of overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success.

Increasing my intensity slightly to 0.75 allows me to take advantage of the current sheep population while still being cautious of competition from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting more challenging. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means hunting intensity should be moderated to ensure sustainability. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me avoid competition and still secure enough food without exhausting the sheep population too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating that hunting may be less rewarding. However, the increase in the wolf population suggests competition for food is rising. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of securing food while still being cautious about overexerting myself in a potentially scarce environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making food scarcer. With an increase in the wolf population, competition for food will be higher.

            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts. This strategy increases my chances of survival by avoiding competition with other wolves for limited resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential failure. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition while still contributing to the pack's overall success.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, which means hunting is becoming more challenging. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. The increase in the wolf population also suggests competition is rising, so I need to be more proactive to ensure my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with the increase in wolves, competition for food will be higher. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This strategy allows me to adapt to the changing environment and ensure my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can better compete with other wolves for the limited resources while still conserving energy for future hunts.",
