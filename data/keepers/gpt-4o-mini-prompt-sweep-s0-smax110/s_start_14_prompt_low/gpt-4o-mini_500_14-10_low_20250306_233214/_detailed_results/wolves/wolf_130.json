            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 16 wolves competing for food, a moderate hunting intensity will allow me to conserve energy while still increasing my chances of a successful hunt. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population means competition for food is rising. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can better secure my share of the dwindling sheep population while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased significantly, which means competition for food is higher. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively when necessary. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a crowded environment.",
