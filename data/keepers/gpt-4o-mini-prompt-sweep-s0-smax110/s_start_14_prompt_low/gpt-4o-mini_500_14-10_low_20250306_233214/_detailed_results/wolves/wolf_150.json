With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively. This way, I can adapt to the changing environment and avoid direct competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding if I go all out. By adjusting my intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, balancing my need for food with the increased competition from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity reduces the risk of overexertion and allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means hunting intensity needs to be balanced. By increasing my theta from 0.30 to 0.50, I can take advantage of the available prey without overexerting myself, ensuring I have enough energy for future hunts while still contributing to the pack's survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, and with more wolves around, competition for food is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This strategy allows me to adapt to the changing environment and ensure my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 23 wolves competing for food, a moderate increase in hunting intensity can help me secure enough resources without overexerting myself. This way, I can balance my energy expenditure while still increasing my chances of a successful hunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of securing food while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased slightly, indicating that food may be becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can maximize my chances of catching enough prey while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food.
