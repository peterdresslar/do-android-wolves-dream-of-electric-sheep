            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy and avoid competition while still contributing to the pack's success.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased slightly, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity from 0.60 to 0.75, I can improve my chances of successfully hunting while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because with an increasing number of wolves and a decreasing sheep population, hunting at a slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's efforts. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the current number of sheep being relatively high compared to the stable wolf population, increasing my hunting intensity will improve my chances of securing food. However, I want to avoid overexerting myself and risking injury or exhaustion, especially since other wolves are also hunting. A theta of 0.75 strikes a balance between being competitive and conserving energy.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population decreasing, I can afford to hunt at a slightly lower intensity while still being efficient. This allows me to conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who may be hunting at maximum intensity. A moderate approach increases my chances of survival in a fluctuating environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population decreasing, it may be wise to conserve energy and avoid overexertion. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can still contribute to the pack's needs while ensuring my own survival in case of future food shortages.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population decreasing, it's important to conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively. A lower intensity allows me to adapt to the changing environment and avoid overexertion, ensuring my survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population decreasing, I need to increase my hunting intensity to secure enough food for survival. However, I must balance this with the risk of overexertion and competition from other wolves. A theta of 0.60 allows me to be more aggressive while still conserving some energy.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting may be more competitive. By increasing my intensity to 0.75, I can improve my chances of securing food while still conserving energy, as the overall wolf population remains stable.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that food is becoming scarcer. By lowering my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This balance will help ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, which means hunting might be less successful. By increasing my intensity slightly from my previous theta of 0.65 to 0.75, I can maximize my chances of catching enough food while still being mindful of the competition from other wolves. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my intensity to 0.75, I can maximize my chances of securing food while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival, especially with the competition from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By lowering my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being proactive in securing food. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of securing enough food while still being mindful of the competition from other wolves. A balance is necessary to ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves remains high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This balanced approach increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively low, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to overexploitation of the prey. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and increase my chances of survival while still contributing to the pack"
