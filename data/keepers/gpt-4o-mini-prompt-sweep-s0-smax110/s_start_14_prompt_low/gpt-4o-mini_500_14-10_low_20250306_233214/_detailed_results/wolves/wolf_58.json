By increasing my intensity slightly from 0.40 to 0.50, I can improve my chances of catching prey without overexerting myself, which is crucial given the stable number of wolves. This balance helps ensure my survival while still being mindful of the competition.",

With fewer sheep available, hunting at maximum intensity may not yield enough returns and could lead to exhaustion. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
