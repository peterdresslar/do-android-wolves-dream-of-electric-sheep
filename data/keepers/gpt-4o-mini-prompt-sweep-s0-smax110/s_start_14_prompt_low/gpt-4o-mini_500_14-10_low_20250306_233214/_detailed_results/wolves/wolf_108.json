This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the wolf population has increased. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because with a stable number of wolves and an increasing number of sheep, I want to balance my hunting intensity. By increasing my theta slightly, I can take advantage of the growing sheep population while still conserving energy and avoiding competition with other wolves who may be hunting at maximum intensity.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a scarcity of food. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to survive longer while waiting for better conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased slightly, indicating a potential scarcity of food.

With the number of wolves remaining constant, a slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive in the hunt. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, indicating a good opportunity for hunting. However, since the number of wolves has remained the same, I want to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can secure enough food without overexerting myself. A theta of 0.75 allows me to be competitive while conserving energy.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased slightly, indicating a stable food source. With the number of wolves remaining the same, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive. This approach balances the need to hunt effectively without overexerting myself, ensuring my survival in the long run.",
