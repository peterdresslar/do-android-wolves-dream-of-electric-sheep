            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, while the wolf population has increased. This means competition for food is higher, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to wasted energy and increased risk of injury. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and still have a chance to catch prey without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population means competition for food is rising. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can balance my energy expenditure with the need to secure food while avoiding overexertion that could leave me vulnerable. This approach allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics of the pack and the declining sheep population.",

By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexerting myself while still being able to hunt effectively if necessary.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making them a more valuable resource. With an increase in the wolf population, competition for food is higher. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of securing enough food while still being mindful of the risks involved in overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, competition for food is increasing, so a moderate intensity will help me conserve energy while still being effective in hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, which means food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can maximize my chances of securing enough food while still being cautious not to overexert myself, as the wolf population remains constant. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",

By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",

By increasing my hunting intensity slightly to 0.50, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy. This balanced approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of resources without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and the number of wolves has also decreased. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are likely hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
