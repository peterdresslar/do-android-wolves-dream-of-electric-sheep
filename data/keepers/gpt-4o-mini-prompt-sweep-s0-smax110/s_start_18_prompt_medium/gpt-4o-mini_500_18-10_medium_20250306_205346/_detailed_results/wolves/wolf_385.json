            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 404\n- Sheep population: 10.45\n- Wolf population: 23.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.350\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.45 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 9.5% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for increased hunting intensity without risking depletion. However, I must remain cautious and avoid overhunting, as the wolf population is also significant. This moderate increase in theta will help sustain both populations while allowing for some growth in the wolf pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is necessary to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 47.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 67, which is relatively high, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain the balance while allowing both populations to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for moderate hunting without risking depletion. This balance will help maintain both sheep and wolf populations while allowing for gradual adjustments as conditions change.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 28.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 68.00, I need to be cautious about overhunting. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for sustainable hunting while also considering the need to compete with other wolves. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.21, which is only 22.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.24, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is 0.32, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for sheep recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.60, which is only 15.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.35 to 0.40, I can help ensure the wolf population remains healthy while still allowing the sheep to recover over time.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.39, which is only 13.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I can increase my hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. A moderate increase to 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.67, which is only 11.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By adopting a lower theta, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize and gradually increase. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.67, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting sustainability while still considering the need for wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.14, which is only 10.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.70, which is only 9.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is an opportunity to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A gradual increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, ensuring that we do not deplete the sheep too quickly while also considering the growth of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.50, which is only 9.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our wolf population without depleting the sheep further, promoting a more balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.45, which is only 9.5% of its maximum capacity. While I want to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I need to be cautious about overhunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a bit more hunting intensity while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance."
