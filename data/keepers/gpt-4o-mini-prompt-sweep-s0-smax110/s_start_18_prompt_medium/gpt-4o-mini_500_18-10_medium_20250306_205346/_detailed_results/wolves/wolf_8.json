This adjustment will help sustain both populations as I respond to the current trends without risking a sudden depletion of sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 43.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure our long-term survival. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that supports both sheep recovery and wolf population health.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level relative to the maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A slight decrease in hunting will help ensure the long-term survival of both populations while still allowing for some hunting to maintain the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.81, which is only 25.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support our wolf population without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance."
