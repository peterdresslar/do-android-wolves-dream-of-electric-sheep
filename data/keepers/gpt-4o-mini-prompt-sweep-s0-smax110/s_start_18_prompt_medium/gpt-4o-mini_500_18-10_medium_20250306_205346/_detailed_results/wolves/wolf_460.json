This value allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover and thrive.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting approach. This will help maintain the balance between the wolf and sheep populations, ensuring that both can thrive without depleting resources. A gradual adjustment is necessary to avoid sudden impacts on the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.41, which is only 29.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is an opportunity to hunt, we must be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A slight decrease in hunting intensity allows for some recovery of the sheep population while still enabling the wolf population to thrive. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 23.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 66, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.33, which is only 18.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By adopting a lower theta value, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize while also preventing overhunting. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.43, which is only 15.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",

To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.24, which is only 11.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of both species.",

This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.71, which is only 9.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is potential for recovery if I reduce hunting intensity slightly. By increasing theta to 0.40, I can maintain a balance that allows for some hunting while also giving the sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.55, which is only 9.6% of its maximum capacity.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.01, which is only 10.0% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting. This will help maintain the balance and prevent a crash in the sheep population.",
