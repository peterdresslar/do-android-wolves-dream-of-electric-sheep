            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 97.73, allowing for a moderate hunting approach that supports sustainable coexistence. With the sheep-to-wolf ratio at 2.22, it\u2019s important to maintain a balance that prevents overhunting while allowing for gradual adjustments as conditions change.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual approach is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly and to maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while it is beneficial to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must also consider the need for balance. A theta of 0.40 allows for a moderate approach that supports both the wolf population and the recovery of sheep, avoiding overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for some hunting without risking depletion. Given that the wolf population is also relatively high, a slight increase in hunting intensity will help sustain our numbers while still allowing the sheep to recover. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and while it is important to maintain a balance, I need to be cautious with hunting intensity. A slight reduction from my previous theta allows for some competition among wolves while still enabling the sheep population to recover. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.41, which is only 29.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I need to maintain some hunting to support the wolf population, I should not overhunt to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while being mindful of the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.44, which is only 23.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring the sustainability of both populations while also considering the current wolf population size.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.33, which is only 18.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.43, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.450 to 0.35, I can focus on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring the long-term survival of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.97, which is only 13.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.51, which is only 12.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still competing with other wolves. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting without depleting the sheep population too quickly, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.24, which is only 11.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase to 0.40 allows for some hunting while still considering the need for sheep recovery and the overall balance of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.53, which is only 10.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.400 to 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring a balance that supports both populations in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.93, which is only 9.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly."
