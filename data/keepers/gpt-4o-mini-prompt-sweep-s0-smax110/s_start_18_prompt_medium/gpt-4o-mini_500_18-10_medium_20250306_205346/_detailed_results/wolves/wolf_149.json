A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",

This moderate adjustment reflects a balanced approach, ensuring the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep.",

This moderate adjustment helps maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and hunting, supporting both our population and the sheep",

This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to maintain balance, considering the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need to avoid over-depletion of the sheep population.",

A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to sustain itself. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",

This indicates that while there is some opportunity for hunting, we must be cautious not to deplete the sheep further.
