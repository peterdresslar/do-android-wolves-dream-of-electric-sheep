            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 78.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, the wolf population is also significant, and to avoid over-depleting the sheep, a moderate hunting intensity is necessary. This theta allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help ensure that both the wolf and sheep populations can thrive together without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the sheep-to-wolf ratio being below 1, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 43.60, which is only 39.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I can increase hunting intensity, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population and maintaining a balance with the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.97, which is only 23.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting without risking depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.45 allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.48, which is only 18.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.43, which is only 15.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.01, which is only 13.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is an opportunity to hunt, I need to be cautious and avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still enabling some hunting to support our population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.46, which is only 12.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the immediate needs of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.29, which is only 11.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for sustenance with the long-term health of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.62, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help support the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual increase aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.03, which is only 10% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By setting a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize and gradually increase. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.86, which is only 9.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is an opportunity to increase hunting slightly to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A small increase to 0.40 maintains a balance between hunting and competing with other wolves, promoting sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.65, which is only 9.7% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting. This will help balance the ecosystem and prevent over-depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.71, which is only 9.7% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will enable me to maintain some hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.96, which is only 10.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity.
