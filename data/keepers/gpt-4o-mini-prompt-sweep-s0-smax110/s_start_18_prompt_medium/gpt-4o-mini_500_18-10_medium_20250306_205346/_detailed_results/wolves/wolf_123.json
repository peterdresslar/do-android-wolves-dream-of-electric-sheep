            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 78.1% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover if needed. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 51.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 67, it is wise to maintain a moderate hunting intensity to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly while still allowing for wolf reproduction. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 39.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both populations can thrive. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while also considering the need for competition among wolves.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.97, which is only 23.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still being mindful of the need to compete with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.48, which is only 18.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is some opportunity for hunting, it is crucial to prioritize the recovery of the sheep population to ensure long-term sustainability. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, which is necessary given the current wolf population of 62. This approach helps maintain balance and prevents overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.43, which is only 15.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I need to maintain some hunting to support the wolf population, I should be cautious not to overhunt and risk depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach to support both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.01, which is only 13.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support our wolf population without risking a significant depletion of the sheep, ensuring a more sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be increased slightly to ensure our survival and reproduction. However, I must be cautious not to overhunt, as the sheep population is still recovering. A gradual increase allows for a sustainable balance.",

This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting sustainability while still considering the need to compete with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.03, which is only 10% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to stabilize while still competing with other wolves. This moderate approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.86, which is only 9.9% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure my pack's survival, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainable coexistence.",

To allow the sheep to recover and avoid depleting their numbers further, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach that supports both wolf and sheep populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.71, which is only 9.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should be cautious with our hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.51, there is still a need for some hunting to support our wolf population. A slight increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing our needs.",

This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover rather than intensifying our hunting.
