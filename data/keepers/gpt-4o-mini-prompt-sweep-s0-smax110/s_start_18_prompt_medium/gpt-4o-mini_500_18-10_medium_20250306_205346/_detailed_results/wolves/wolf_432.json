            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 471\n- Sheep population: 13.51\n- Wolf population: 45.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.350\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.30 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 12.3% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A balanced approach will help maintain both the sheep and wolf populations sustainably, avoiding overhunting while still allowing for some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and while it is important to maintain a healthy wolf population, I need to be cautious about overhunting. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still providing enough resources for the wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and while I want to ensure the wolves can reproduce, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, preventing over-depletion of the sheep while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 88.8% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring the sheep can recover if needed.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must also ensure that the sheep can recover. A moderate adjustment allows for coexistence while being mindful of the trends in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 49.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. Given that the wolf population is also relatively high, a slight reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and allow both populations to thrive. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of making gradual changes to ensure long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 41.65, which is only 37.9% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, reducing hunting intensity while still competing with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.41, which is only 29.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I need to maintain some hunting to support wolf reproduction, I should also be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.44, which is only 23.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for more hunting to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious to avoid overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.33, which is only 18.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more conservative approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting to sustain the wolf population. A theta of 0.35 reflects a moderate balance, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.43, which is only 15.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is an opportunity to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A gradual increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, avoiding overexploitation while responding to the current dynamics.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.97, which is only 13.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.51, which is only 12.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover. A small increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly."
