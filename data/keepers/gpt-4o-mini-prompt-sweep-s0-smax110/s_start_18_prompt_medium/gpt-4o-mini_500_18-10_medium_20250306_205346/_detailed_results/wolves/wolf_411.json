            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at its maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover and ensures that our wolf population remains stable without overexploiting the resource.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderate to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, supporting both populations in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 8.46, it is crucial to focus on competition among wolves to ensure our long-term survival while giving sheep a chance to rebound.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for sheep recovery while also managing competition among wolves. This balanced approach supports the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery. Maintaining a lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, preventing over-exploitation of the sheep population while we focus on competing with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers, jeopardizing long-term sustainability. Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover while keeping the wolf population in check.",

Maintaining a focus on competition with other wolves will help stabilize our population while ensuring the sheep can bounce back.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and while I need to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a sustainable balance. This adjustment will help support the wolf population without risking a rapid decline in sheep numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 88.8% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support the wolf population without risking the depletion of sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 78.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.66, it is important to maintain a balance to avoid overhunting. A slight decrease in hunting intensity allows for the sheep population to recover while still ensuring the wolf population remains stable.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the wolf population is relatively high. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still providing enough resources for the wolves. This approach helps maintain balance and avoids depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover gradually.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.41, which is only 29.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is some opportunity for hunting, it is crucial to allow the sheep to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, promoting a balance that supports both populations in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.44, which is only 23.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly."
