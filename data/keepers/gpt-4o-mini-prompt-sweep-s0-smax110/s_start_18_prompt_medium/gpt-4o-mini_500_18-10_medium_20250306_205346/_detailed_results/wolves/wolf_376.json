            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still healthy at 93.8% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment promotes wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sustainable coexistence. A gradual increase is prudent to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 93.18, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction. However, I must remain cautious and avoid overhunting, as the sheep population is not at maximum capacity. This moderate adjustment helps maintain a balance while considering the trends in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term health of both populations. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to ensure that the sheep can recover and that the wolf population remains stable.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment reflects a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover and thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the balance between wolf and sheep populations. This adjustment helps ensure that both populations can thrive without leading to depletion or overcompetition.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing sheep to recover. It reflects a balanced approach, responding to the current conditions and trends.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 30.85, which is only 28.0% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance and promote sustainability in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery. A gradual increase helps maintain balance and avoids sudden population crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.24, which is only 17.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing more on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I need to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.39, which is only 13.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for more hunting to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious to avoid overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.67, which is only 11.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack without depleting the sheep further, promoting a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be increased slightly to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A gradual increase allows for sustainable coexistence while still being mindful of the need to compete with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.14, which is only 10.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should prioritize the recovery of the sheep population while still allowing for some hunting to sustain our own numbers. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for food with the necessity of allowing the sheep to recover."
