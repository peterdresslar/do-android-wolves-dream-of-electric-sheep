A moderate hunting intensity will allow for some sheep recovery while also keeping the wolf population healthy. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.41, which is only 29.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is some opportunity for hunting, it is crucial to avoid overexploitation to allow the sheep population to recover. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.44, which is only 23.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery.",

This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a more balanced approach, focusing on maintaining wolf numbers while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.43, which is only 15.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring a balance that supports both populations.",

This indicates that there is a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach that acknowledges the need for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term survival of both species. This gradual adjustment helps maintain a sustainable ecosystem.",
