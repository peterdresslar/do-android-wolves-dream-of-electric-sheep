            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 49\n- Sheep population: 11.74\n- Wolf population: 37.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.400\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.32 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 10.7% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 102.73, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 91.52, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This value reflects a balanced approach, considering the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need to avoid over-depleting the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still maintaining a sustainable balance with the sheep population, which is recovering. A gradual increase is prudent to avoid over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while it is beneficial to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must also consider the growing wolf population. A moderate approach will help maintain balance and prevent depletion of the sheep, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 43.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With the wolf population at 69, which is relatively high, a slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling wolves to maintain their numbers. This moderate approach helps ensure long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.68, which is only 32.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for more hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still considering the need for balance as the wolf population is relatively high.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.81, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to increase. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.39, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help support the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual increase is essential to maintain balance and avoid sudden crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.62, which is only 16.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing our need for food with the necessity of allowing the sheep to rebound.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.10, which is only 14.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach while still being mindful of the need to avoid overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.07, which is only 12.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for sheep recovery. By slightly lowering my hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.64, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can recover over time.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.74, which is only 10.7% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. This adjustment will help balance the ecosystem without depleting the sheep population further."
