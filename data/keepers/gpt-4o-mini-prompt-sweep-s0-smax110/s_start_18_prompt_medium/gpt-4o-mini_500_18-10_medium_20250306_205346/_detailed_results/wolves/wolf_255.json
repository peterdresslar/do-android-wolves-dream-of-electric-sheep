            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 82.09, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, I want to avoid depleting their numbers too quickly, so I will maintain a balance that supports both wolf reproduction and sheep recovery. This adjustment is gradual to ensure sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help support wolf reproduction while still ensuring that the sheep population can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is necessary to maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover over time.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly, and this balance supports long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.57, which is only 28.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still giving sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.66, which is only 23.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is some opportunity for hunting, it is crucial to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep. This approach helps prevent over-depletion of the sheep population and supports sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively low at 21.17, which is only 19.2% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being mindful of the sheep population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.79, which is only 16.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for the sheep to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus on reducing competition with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.39, which is only 14.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.89, which is only 12.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need to compete with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to support our population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.89, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a balance as the wolf population is relatively high, and we need to ensure sustainable cycles. A gradual increase is prudent to avoid sudden impacts on the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.02, which is only 10.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting without risking a rapid decline in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.50, which is only 10.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting without risking depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach to hunting while still considering the need to compete with other wolves. This adjustment aims to support both the wolf population and the sustainability of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.22, which is only 10.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both the sheep and the wolf population while still competing with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.08, which is only 10.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting without risking depletion. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.35 to 0.40, I can focus on hunting while still allowing for the sheep population to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
