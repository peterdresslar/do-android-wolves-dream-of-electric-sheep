            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A theta of 0.45 strikes a balance between maintaining my hunting needs and ensuring the sheep population can stabilize, preventing future crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover and prevent overexploitation. This lower theta will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at its maximum capacity, indicating that we should be cautious with our hunting to avoid depleting their numbers. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring both can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 93.4% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 91.52, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This value reflects a cautious approach, allowing for gradual adjustments as conditions change, and helps maintain a sustainable balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because it represents a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balanced approach. The sheep population is currently at 70.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. This adjustment allows for a gradual increase in hunting as the sheep population is healthy, while also being mindful of the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting approach. This will help maintain the balance between wolf and sheep populations while avoiding overhunting, which could lead to future scarcity of prey. Gradually adjusting my hunting intensity will also help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery. A gradual increase is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 32.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.51, it is essential to maintain a balance that allows for the recovery of the sheep while also considering the growing wolf population. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.81, which is only 25.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, preventing over-exploitation of the sheep and ensuring our long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.39, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without depleting their numbers too quickly. This adjustment will help maintain a balance as the sheep population recovers, while also supporting the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.62, which is only 16.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support our wolf population without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.10, which is only 14.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach to hunting while still being cautious about the wolf population growth. This adjustment aims to maintain a healthy ecosystem and avoid sudden changes that could disrupt the balance."
