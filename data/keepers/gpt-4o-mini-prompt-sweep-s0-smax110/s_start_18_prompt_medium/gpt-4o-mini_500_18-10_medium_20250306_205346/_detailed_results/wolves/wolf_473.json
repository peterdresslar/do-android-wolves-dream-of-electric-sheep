            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 41.65, which is only 37.9% of its maximum capacity. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.59, it is crucial to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also considering the growing wolf population. A moderate theta will help maintain a balance, ensuring both species can thrive without depleting resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.41, which is only 29.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is room for some hunting to support wolf reproduction, we must be cautious not to over-deplete the sheep. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting to sustain our pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.44, which is only 23.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still considering the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.33, which is only 18.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, ensuring we do not over-deplete the sheep while still competing effectively with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.43, which is only 15.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach without over-depleting the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.97, which is only 13.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus slightly more on competition with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This approach helps ensure long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.51, which is only 12.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should be cautious with our hunting to allow the sheep to recover. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.30, there is still some competition among wolves. A slight increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf health while giving sheep a chance to rebound.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.24, which is only 11.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 reflects a balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population.",

This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.93, which is only 9.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can maintain a balance that supports both the wolf population and the sheep, avoiding overhunting while still allowing for some hunting to sustain our pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.71, which is only 9.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates a need for recovery. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to replenish while also managing competition with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.55, which is only 9.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.49, which is only 15.0% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.35 aligns with the wisdom of making small adjustments and responding to the current state of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.70, which is only 16.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is an opportunity to hunt, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for some hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.97, which is only 17.2% of its maximum capacity. While I want to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I need to be cautious about hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.45, which is only 18.6% of its maximum capacity. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain our wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover. This adjustment is gradual, aligning with the wisdom of adapting to changing conditions without risking a sudden depletion of sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.99, which is only 20% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for the sheep to recover. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to increase their numbers while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.80, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring sustainability while allowing for some growth in the wolf pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.71, which is only 23.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is some opportunity for hunting, it is essential to avoid overexploitation. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a more cautious approach, promoting the recovery of the sheep population while still enabling some hunting to sustain the wolf pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.83, which is only 25.3% of its maximum capacity.
