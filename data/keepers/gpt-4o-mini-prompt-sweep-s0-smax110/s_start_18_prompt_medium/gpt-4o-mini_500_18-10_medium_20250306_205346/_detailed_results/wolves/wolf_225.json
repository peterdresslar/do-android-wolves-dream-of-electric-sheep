            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity slightly to allow the sheep to recover while still competing with other wolves. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance while still considering the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery. Maintaining a lower theta helps ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, preventing overhunting and promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that they are vulnerable to overhunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a moderate hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term survival of both species. This approach helps maintain a balance as the wolf population grows.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is close to its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 95.41, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a sustainable balance. This adjustment will help support the wolf population without risking a rapid depletion of sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 74.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep. However, the wolf population is also significant at 54, which suggests that I should focus on maintaining balance rather than intensifying hunting. A slight decrease in theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing competition among wolves, ensuring both populations can thrive without depleting resources too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support the wolf population without risking a significant decline in sheep numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 48.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.79, I need to be cautious about overhunting, as it could lead to a depletion of sheep and ultimately harm our long-term survival. A slight decrease in hunting intensity allows for a more sustainable balance while still keeping an eye on the wolf population, which is currently at 67.00.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover gradually.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.57, which is only 28.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack but prioritizes the long-term balance and recovery of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.66, which is only 23.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting without risking depletion. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.35 to 0.40, I can help ensure the wolf population remains healthy while still allowing the sheep population to recover over time.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.17, which is only 19.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our needs without depleting the sheep further, promoting a healthier balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.79, which is only 16.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. Increasing theta slightly from 0.35 to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach to hunting while still considering the need for sustainable coexistence. It also prepares for potential increases in the sheep population in the future.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.39, which is only 14.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, reducing pressure on the sheep while still enabling us to compete effectively with other wolves."
