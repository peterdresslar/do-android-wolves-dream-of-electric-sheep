            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for moderate hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A slight increase from my previous theta will support reproduction without risking depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at nearly half of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, the wolf population is also relatively high, so a moderate approach allows for coexistence while preventing overhunting of sheep. This balance will help maintain both populations in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and while it is important to increase hunting to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A slight reduction from my previous theta allows for a more balanced approach, giving the sheep a chance to recover while still enabling my pack to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.41, which is only 29.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.44, which is only 23.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach to hunting while still being mindful of the wolf population, which is currently at 66.00. This adjustment aims to maintain a healthy dynamic between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.33, which is only 18.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to stabilize while still competing with other wolves. This moderate approach aligns with my goal of ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.43, which is only 15.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.97, which is only 13.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.51, which is only 12.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain my pack without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that considers both the current low sheep population and the need to maintain a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.24, which is only 11.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, reducing pressure on the sheep while still enabling us to compete effectively with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.53, which is only 10.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.93, which is only 9.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population and maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.71, which is only 9.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting without risking depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach to hunting while still considering the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.55, which is only 9.6% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population, a moderate hunting intensity is appropriate. This value reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for sustenance with the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.63, which is only 9.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves and allow the sheep population to stabilize and grow, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.73, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.01, which is only 10.0% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.44, which is only 10.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is an opportunity to hunt, I should be cautious and not overexert myself. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a balance and adapting gradually to the ecosystem",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition, ensuring both populations can thrive in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.42, which is only 11.3% of its maximum capacity.
