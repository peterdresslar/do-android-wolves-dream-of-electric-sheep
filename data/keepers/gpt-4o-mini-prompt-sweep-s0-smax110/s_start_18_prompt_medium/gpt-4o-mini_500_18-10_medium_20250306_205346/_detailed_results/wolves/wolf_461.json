With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.80, it is important to maintain a balance that allows both populations to thrive. A moderate theta of 0.45 reflects a cautious approach, allowing for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep.",

This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.4 to 0.35, I can maintain a balance that focuses on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.93, which is only 9.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover rather than intensifying hunting. A moderate theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and allowing the sheep population to stabilize, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
