However, with the wolf population at 70, which is relatively high, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves while allowing the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, ensuring that both populations can thrive without depleting resources too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 36.77, which is only 33.4% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still being cautious. A theta of 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, enabling us to sustain our wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover gradually.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.15, which is only 25.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is potential for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for more hunting intensity while still being cautious, as the wolf population is relatively high at 69. I aim to maintain a balance that supports both populations in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.10, which is only 20.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting without risking depletion. However, with a wolf population of 65.00, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.85, which is only 16.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to be cautious with our hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 to 0.35 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for some hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.40, which is only 14.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased slightly to support wolf reproduction, it must be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate increase to 0.40 allows for some hunting while still considering the need for sheep recovery and maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the wolf population is relatively high. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to compete effectively. This moderate approach helps maintain balance and avoids depleting the sheep further.",
