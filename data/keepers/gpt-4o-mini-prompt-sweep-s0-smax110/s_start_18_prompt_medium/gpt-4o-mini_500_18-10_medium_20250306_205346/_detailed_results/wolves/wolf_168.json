            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 188\n- Sheep population: 13.64\n- Wolf population: 43.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.400\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.32 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 12.4% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that they can sustain a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. A theta of 0.75 allows for a balance between hunting and ensuring the sheep population can recover, while also supporting the growth of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still healthy at 94.4% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain our wolf population while still being mindful of the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 86.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 2.06, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 74.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with the wolf population at 54, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.07, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while preventing over-depletion of the sheep. This approach aligns with the need for balance as the wolf population is also relatively high, and small adjustments will help maintain stability in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and while it is important to maintain a balance, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta will help sustain my pack while still being cautious about the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.00, which is only 28.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I can increase my hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction, I need to be cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. A small increase to 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.67, which is only 22.4% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A lower theta value will help reduce hunting intensity and allow for a more sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.12, which is only 18.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain our wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for gradual adjustments.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.25, which is only 15.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate increase to 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population and maintaining a balance with the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.13, which is only 13.8% of its maximum capacity. While I need to focus on hunting to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a more balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the immediate needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.64, which is only 12.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on the competition with other wolves, ensuring a balanced approach that supports both populations."
