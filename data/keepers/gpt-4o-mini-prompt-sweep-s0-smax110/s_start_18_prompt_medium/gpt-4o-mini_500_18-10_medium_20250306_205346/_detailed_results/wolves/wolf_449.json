            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 475\n- Sheep population: 10.71\n- Wolf population: 27.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.350\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.40 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 9.7% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep. This adjustment reflects the need to maintain a sustainable coexistence, as the sheep population is not overly depleted, and it allows for gradual adaptation to the changing conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is key to avoiding drastic changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 49.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. Given the current wolf population, a moderate approach allows for coexistence while still enabling some hunting to support our pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 41.65, and the wolf population is relatively high at 70.00. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity slightly to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining enough hunting to support our pack's needs. This moderate adjustment will help balance the ecosystem without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.41, which is only 29.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I need to maintain a balance, I can afford to increase my hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A gradual increase to 0.45 allows for sustainable coexistence while still being mindful of the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.44, which is only 23.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is some room for hunting, I need to be cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.450 to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, focusing on sustainable coexistence while still considering the need for wolf population health.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.33, which is only 18.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is some opportunity for hunting, it is essential to prioritize the recovery of the sheep population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.43, which is only 15.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase to 0.40 allows for a more balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still giving sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.97, which is only 13.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach that balances our need for sustenance with the long-term health of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I need to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.24, which is only 11.1% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.53, which is only 10.5% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still being cautious. A theta of 0.40 reflects a balanced approach that acknowledges the need for sustainable coexistence, allowing for gradual recovery of the sheep population while also supporting the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.93, which is only 9.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By maintaining a moderate hunting intensity, I can ensure that the wolf population remains healthy while allowing the sheep to gradually increase. This approach aligns with the wisdom of making small adjustments and focusing on sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.71, which is only 9.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some reproduction among wolves while still giving sheep a chance to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep further."
