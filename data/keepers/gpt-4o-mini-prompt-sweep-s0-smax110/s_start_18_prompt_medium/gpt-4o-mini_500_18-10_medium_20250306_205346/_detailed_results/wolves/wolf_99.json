            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and my previous theta was already low. To allow the sheep to recover and avoid overhunting, I will maintain a cautious approach while still competing with other wolves. This gradual adjustment will help ensure the long-term survival of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution in hunting to prevent depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the growth of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderate to allow for recovery while still supporting the wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is close to its maximum capacity, and a slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain the balance without depleting the sheep too quickly. This adjustment allows for sustainable coexistence while also supporting the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 97.17, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 78.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.62, I need to be cautious about overhunting to ensure the long-term survival of both species. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, enabling the sheep to recover while still providing enough resources for the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing sheep to recover. It reflects a balanced approach, considering both the current state and the trends in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 51.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 67, which is relatively high compared to the sheep, I need to focus on maintaining balance. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow sheep to recover while still enabling wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 39.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, which is relatively high, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for more hunting while still considering the long-term balance of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 30.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 69, which is relatively high, I need to be cautious about overhunting. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.97, which is only 23.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.48, which is only 18.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it is crucial to do so gradually to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting while still focusing on the competition with other wolves, ensuring a balance that promotes long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.43, which is only 15.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I can increase my hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. A small increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.01, which is only 13.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while prioritizing the sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.46, which is only 12.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly."
