            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for some increased hunting intensity without risking depletion. Given that the sheep population is at 60.4% of maximum capacity, I can afford to maintain a strong hunting approach while still being mindful of the wolf population growth. This adjustment is gradual and aligns with the need to balance both populations effectively.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 47.2% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep do not become too depleted. A gradual approach is essential to avoid sudden crashes in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A theta of 0.45 strikes a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can stabilize, promoting long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level (22.0% of maximum capacity), and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are not enough sheep to support aggressive hunting. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will help the sheep recover while still allowing for some reproduction among wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.24, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we are nearing a critical point for sustainable hunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.60, which is only 15.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for more hunting intensity while still being cautious, as the wolf population is relatively high at 54. I aim to maintain a balance that supports both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the wolf population is relatively high. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to compete effectively. This moderate approach helps maintain balance and avoids depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.67, which is only 11.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some reproduction among wolves while still giving sheep a chance to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach that can help sustain both populations without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.67, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.4 to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, reducing hunting intensity while still maintaining some level of hunting to support our pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.14, which is only 10.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.70, which is only 9.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population. This gradual adjustment will help ensure long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.50, which is only 9.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is a need to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining some hunting to support the wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, ensuring that I do not over-deplete the sheep while still competing effectively with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.45, which is only 9.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.53, which is only 9.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are struggling, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to their depletion. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.80, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a slight hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A moderate increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while being mindful of the need to adapt to changing conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.09, which is only 10.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still recognizing the need to adapt to the current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.41, which is only 10.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from the previous theta of 0.40 to 0.35, I can still maintain some hunting while focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring a balance that supports both populations in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.90, which is only 10.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further.
