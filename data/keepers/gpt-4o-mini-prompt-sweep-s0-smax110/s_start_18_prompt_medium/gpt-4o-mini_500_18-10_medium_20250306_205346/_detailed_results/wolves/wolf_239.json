            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is close to its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. A moderate approach allows for sustainable coexistence while giving sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment helps avoid overhunting and maintains the balance in our ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently healthy, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while still maintaining a sustainable balance, considering the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need for gradual changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population while still ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A moderate approach balances our needs with the ecosystem",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the sheep-to-wolf ratio being below 1, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level (36.8% of maximum capacity) and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we are competing for resources. By lowering my hunting intensity slightly, I can allow the sheep population to recover while still maintaining a focus on competition with other wolves. This gradual adjustment will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.57, which is only 28.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should be cautious with our hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between hunting and allowing the sheep population to grow, while also considering the current wolf population of 69. A moderate approach will support both species",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.66, which is only 23.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is some opportunity for hunting, it is crucial to prioritize the recovery of the sheep population to ensure long-term sustainability. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, which is necessary given the current wolf population of 64. This approach helps maintain balance without risking a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.17, which is only 19.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I need to be cautious about overhunting, I can afford to increase my hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction. A theta of 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the immediate needs of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.79, which is only 16.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for more hunting while still considering the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.39, which is only 14.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity could be increased, it is more prudent to focus on competition with other wolves to allow the sheep population to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the long-term balance of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.89, which is only 12.6% of its maximum capacity. Given the high wolf population of 44.00, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.89, which is only 11.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while being mindful of the need to avoid overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.02, which is only 10.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly."
