            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover and ensures the long-term survival of both species. It also helps to stabilize the wolf population as we focus on competing with other wolves rather than depleting our prey.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition with other wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and a slight increase in hunting intensity will help manage their numbers while still allowing for recovery. This moderate adjustment reflects a balance between ensuring the wolf population remains healthy and preventing over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is close to its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A gradual increase is essential to ensure sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 97.73, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while maintaining a sustainable balance. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 86.23, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep. This moderate adjustment reflects a cautious approach to ensure sustainability as the sheep population is at 78.4% of its maximum capacity. It allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction without risking a significant depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover and thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 49.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 68, which is relatively high, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, giving sheep a chance to recover while still enabling wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 41.65, which is only 37.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I can increase my hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. A moderate increase to 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for sustainable cycles.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.41, which is only 29.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is some room for hunting, it is crucial to avoid overexploitation. A moderate theta of 0.40 allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population and maintaining a balance with the growing wolf population.",

This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.33, which is only 18.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting a lower theta, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of adapting to changing conditions without causing sudden disruptions.",
