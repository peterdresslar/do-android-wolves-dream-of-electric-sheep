By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep to recover while ensuring our long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at its maximum capacity, and hunting intensity should remain low to allow the sheep to recover. Maintaining a lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, preventing over-exploitation of the sheep population while we focus on competing with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers.

By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to rebound, ensuring long-term sustainability for both populations.",

This approach supports the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be cautiously increased to prevent over-depletion. However, given the current wolf population and the need to maintain balance, a small adjustment upwards allows for sustainable coexistence while avoiding drastic changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is close to its maximum capacity, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that considers both the current sheep population and the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that I can increase my hunting intensity slightly without risking a significant depletion of the sheep. However, I must remain cautious and avoid drastic changes, as the wolf population is also a factor to consider. A moderate increase allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we have enough prey to sustain our pack without overhunting. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover further while still supporting our wolf population.",

However, with the wolf population at 54.00, I need to be cautious not to overhunt and deplete the sheep too quickly. A gradual increase to 0.45 allows for sustainable coexistence while still supporting wolf reproduction.",

This moderate adjustment helps maintain balance as the wolf population grows, ensuring we do not deplete the sheep too quickly.",

With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.59, it is essential to maintain a balanced approach to ensure the long-term survival of both species. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while still enabling the wolf population to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.57, which is only 28.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still focusing on the competition with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.66, which is only 23.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
