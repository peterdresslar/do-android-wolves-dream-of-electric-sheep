            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and my previous theta was quite low. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition with other wolves. A gradual increase from my previous theta will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at its maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. This will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem and prevent over-depletion of the sheep, ensuring long-term survival for both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach that considers both the current sheep population and the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 101.88, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring the sheep can recover if needed. A gradual increase is essential to avoid sudden population crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 91.38, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction. However, with the wolf population at 51.00, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 69.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.28, it is essential to maintain a balance that allows for both wolf and sheep populations to thrive. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will help ensure that we do not deplete the sheep too quickly while still allowing for some hunting to support our wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 55.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 66, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to prevent a crash in the sheep population. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that supports both wolf reproduction and sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 43.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 70, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 33.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 70, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.15, which is only 25.6% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.10, which is only 20.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.85, which is only 16.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting a lower theta, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize while still ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low at 15.40, which is only 14.0% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will enable me to hunt more effectively while still prioritizing the sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.48, which is only 12.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we can afford to increase our hunting intensity slightly to ensure our pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.06, which is only 11.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from the previous theta of 0.450 to 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves and ensure sustainable coexistence."
