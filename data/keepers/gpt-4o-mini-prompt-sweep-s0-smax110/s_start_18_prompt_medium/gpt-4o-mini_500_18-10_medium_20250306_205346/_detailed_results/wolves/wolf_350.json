            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that they are vulnerable to overhunting. A moderate hunting intensity will allow for some reproduction among wolves while giving the sheep a chance to recover, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A balanced approach will help maintain the sheep population while ensuring the wolf pack remains healthy. This adjustment reflects a sustainable coexistence strategy.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. A lower theta will help balance competition among wolves while ensuring the sheep can regain their numbers, promoting long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and hunting more aggressively could lead to their depletion. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a stable wolf population. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at its maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows the sheep to recover and ensures that the wolf population remains sustainable in the long term. This balanced approach helps avoid potential crashes in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at maximum capacity, and maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover and prevents overexploitation. This approach also helps to stabilize the wolf population by reducing competition among wolves, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution in hunting to allow for recovery. Maintaining a lower theta will help ensure the sustainability of both sheep and wolf populations, preventing overhunting and potential crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery. Maintaining a lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, as it prevents overhunting and allows the sheep population to stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to depletion of their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",

This moderate adjustment allows for sustainable coexistence while still supporting the wolf population.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual increase is prudent to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 47.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With the wolf population at 67, which is relatively high, a slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. This moderate approach helps ensure long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 39.89, which is only 36.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting without risking depletion. However, with the wolf population at 69, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 allows for a balanced approach that supports both reproduction and sustainability.",

This adjustment will help support the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A gradual increase is prudent to avoid sudden impacts on the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.24, which is only 17.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing our own population. A moderate theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species."
