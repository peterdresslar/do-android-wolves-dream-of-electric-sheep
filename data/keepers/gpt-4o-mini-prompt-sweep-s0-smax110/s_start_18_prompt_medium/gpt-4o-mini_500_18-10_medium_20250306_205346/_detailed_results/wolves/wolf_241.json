            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is close to its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a sustainable balance. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction without risking a rapid decline in the sheep population. A moderate approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 95.41, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that can support wolf reproduction while avoiding over-depletion of the sheep. This adjustment maintains a balance between competing with other wolves and hunting, ensuring the long-term survival of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term sustainability while still allowing for some growth in the wolf pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that while there are enough sheep to support my pack, we should not overhunt to allow for recovery and future stability. A slight decrease from my previous theta will help maintain balance as the wolf population grows.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain the balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring both can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity slightly to allow the sheep to recover while still competing with other wolves. This moderate approach will help maintain a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.57, which is only 28.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I need to maintain some hunting to support wolf reproduction, I should also be cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.66, which is only 23.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.400 to 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring the sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.17, which is only 19.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A small increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of the wolf pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.79, which is only 16.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I can increase my hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. A gradual increase to 0.45 allows for a balanced approach that supports both the wolf population and the recovery of sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.39, which is only 14.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, reducing pressure on the sheep while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.89, which is only 12.6% of its maximum capacity. With the wolf population at 44.00, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both species by preventing overhunting and promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.89, which is only 11.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some recovery while still ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.02, which is only 10.9% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I also want to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help me maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability without depleting the sheep further."
