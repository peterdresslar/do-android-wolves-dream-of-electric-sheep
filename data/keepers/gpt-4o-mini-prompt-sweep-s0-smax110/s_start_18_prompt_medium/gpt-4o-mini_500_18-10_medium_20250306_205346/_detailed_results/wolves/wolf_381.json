            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 84.7% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 47, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both populations can thrive. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.407 allows for sustainable coexistence while still addressing the needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 72.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.43, it is wise to maintain a moderate hunting intensity to ensure the sheep can recover while still allowing for some reproduction among wolves. This adjustment allows for a sustainable balance without risking a rapid decline in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is key to avoiding drastic fluctuations in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 47.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 67, which is relatively high, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring both populations can thrive without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 39.89, which is only 36.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I can increase my hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A moderate increase to 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 30.85, which is only 28.0% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance, reducing hunting intensity slightly to promote sheep growth while still allowing for some hunting to sustain the wolf pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.21, which is only 22.0% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A gradual increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.24, which is only 17.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population and maintaining a balance with the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.60, which is only 15.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain our wolf population without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for gradual adjustments.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.39, which is only 13.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support our needs without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.67, which is only 11.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still recognizing the need to adapt to the current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.67, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining some hunting to support our wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.4 to 0.35 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for sustainable coexistence without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.14, which is only 10.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need to adapt to the changing conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.70, which is only 9.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own wolf population. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.50, which is only 9.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.40 strikes a balance between hunting and competition, promoting sustainability."
