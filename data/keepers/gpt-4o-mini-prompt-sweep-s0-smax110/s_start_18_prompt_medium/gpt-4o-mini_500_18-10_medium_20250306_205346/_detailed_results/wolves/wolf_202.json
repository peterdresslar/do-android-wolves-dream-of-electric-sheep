            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 205\n- Sheep population: 18.72\n- Wolf population: 6.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.450\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 3.12 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 17.0% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a balance between the wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term survival for both.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery. A gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining balance in our ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.00, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we are nearing a critical point for sustainable hunting. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain its health. This moderate approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments to ensure long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.67, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help sustain both populations while also considering the growing wolf numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.12, which is only 18.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is an opportunity for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, focusing on maintaining the wolf population while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.25, which is only 15.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that the sheep can recover if I reduce my hunting intensity slightly. By setting theta to 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.13, which is only 13.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and hunting, ensuring both populations can thrive in the long term.",

This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly, considering the current dynamics.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.89, which is only 10.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A theta of 0.35 reflects a balanced approach, focusing on coexistence and gradual recovery of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.46, which is only 10.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves.",

This suggests that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also considering the growing wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack without depleting the sheep further, promoting a balance that can lead to long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.12, which is only 10.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. With a wolf population of 23, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is already low at 0.48, suggesting that we should focus on reducing competition among wolves rather than intensifying hunting. A lower theta will help maintain balance and ensure the long-term survival of both species.",

This suggests that we should be cautious with our hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will help maintain a balance while still allowing for some hunting to support the wolf population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of making gradual adjustments in response to population changes.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.14, which is only 11.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is an opportunity to hunt, I need to be cautious and avoid overexploitation. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This balanced approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining sustainable cycles.",
