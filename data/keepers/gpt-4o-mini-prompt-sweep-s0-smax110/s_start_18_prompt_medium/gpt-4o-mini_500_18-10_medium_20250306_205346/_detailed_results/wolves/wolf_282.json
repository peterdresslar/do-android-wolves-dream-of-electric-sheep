Maintaining a focus on competition with other wolves will help stabilize our population while ensuring that sheep can rebound in the future.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. With a high sheep-to-wolf ratio, focusing on competition among wolves will help maintain our population while giving sheep a chance to rebound.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. A moderate approach will help maintain a balance between the wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term survival for both.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery. Maintaining a balance is crucial to ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, especially as the wolf population is relatively stable. Gradual adjustments will help avoid drastic fluctuations in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that a slight increase in hunting intensity is appropriate to maintain balance. However, I must be cautious and avoid drastic changes, as the wolf population is relatively stable. A moderate increase allows for sustainable coexistence while ensuring that both populations can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 92.6% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a sustainable balance. This adjustment will help support the wolf population without risking a rapid depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sustainable coexistence. A gradual increase helps maintain balance as both populations fluctuate.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 69.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.28, it is essential to maintain a balance that allows for sustainable coexistence. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help ensure that the sheep can recover while still allowing for some reproduction among the wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover and thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 43.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without risking depletion. However, with the wolf population at 70, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This will help support wolf reproduction while still maintaining a balance that prevents over-depletion of the sheep. A gradual adjustment is essential to ensure both populations can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.15, which is only 25.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.40 allows for some hunting to support our wolf population without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.10, which is only 20.1% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A moderate adjustment helps maintain balance as we adapt to the current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.85, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a significant competition for resources among wolves. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while also giving sheep a chance to recover. This approach helps maintain a balance between the two populations, avoiding over-depletion of sheep and ensuring the long-term survival of both species."
