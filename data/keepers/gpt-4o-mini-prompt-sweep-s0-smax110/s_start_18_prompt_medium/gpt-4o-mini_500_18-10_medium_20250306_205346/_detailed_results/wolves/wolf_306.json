            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 330\n- Sheep population: 11.18\n- Wolf population: 38.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.350\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.29 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 10.2% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and while I want to maintain a healthy wolf population, I also need to allow the sheep to recover slightly. A small decrease in hunting intensity will help balance the ecosystem without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 101.88, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This slight decrease from my previous theta reflects a cautious approach to maintain balance as the wolf population is also significant at 44. I aim to avoid overhunting and promote sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 83.1% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing sustainability. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to ensure both wolf and sheep populations can thrive without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment reflects a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the long-term health of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while I want to ensure my pack thrives, I also need to allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease from my previous theta will help maintain balance and prevent overhunting, which could lead to future scarcity.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 43.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. Given the current wolf population, a slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach to hunting while still considering the need to compete with other wolves. This gradual adjustment helps maintain a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 33.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.53, it is important to maintain a balance that allows for sustainable coexistence. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help the sheep recover while still allowing for some hunting to support the wolf population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.15, which is only 25.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that considers both the need for wolf population sustainability and the recovery of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.10, which is only 20.1% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, allowing both populations to stabilize without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.85, which is only 16.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.400 to 0.35, I can focus on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.40, which is only 14.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach that considers both the current low sheep numbers and the need to maintain a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.48, which is only 12.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the wolf population is relatively high. A lower theta allows for competition among wolves, which can help stabilize our numbers while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.18, which is only 10.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some reproduction among wolves while still giving sheep a chance to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting sustainability without risking a rapid decline in the sheep population."
