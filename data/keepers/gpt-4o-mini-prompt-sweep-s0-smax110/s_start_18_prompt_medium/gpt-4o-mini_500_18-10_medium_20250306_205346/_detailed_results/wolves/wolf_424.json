            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that they can sustain some hunting pressure without immediate risk of depletion. However, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting, as the wolf population is relatively stable. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain our population while allowing the sheep to recover in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to prevent depletion. A theta of 0.60 allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery. This balance will help maintain a sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A balanced approach will help maintain the sheep population while also ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. This adjustment reflects the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and while it is tempting to increase hunting intensity, it is crucial to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta will help maintain a balance, ensuring the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep while avoiding overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and a slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain the balance while allowing for some recovery of the sheep. This adjustment is gradual, ensuring that we do not deplete the sheep too quickly while still supporting the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is close to its maximum capacity, indicating that we should be cautious with our hunting to avoid depleting their numbers too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support our population while still promoting sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we can afford to maintain a moderate hunting intensity. This will allow for sustainable coexistence while also considering the gradual increase in wolf numbers. A slight decrease from my previous theta will help ensure that we do not deplete the sheep population too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 78.4% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 52, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both populations. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance as the wolf population grows, ensuring we do not deplete the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 37.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 70, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.41, which is only 29.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should maintain a moderate hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while still ensuring our wolf population remains healthy. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a gradual adjustment in response to the sheep population, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.44, which is only 23.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be slightly increased to support wolf reproduction, it is crucial to avoid overhunting to allow the sheep population to recover. A small adjustment to 0.40 maintains a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.33, which is only 18.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack without depleting the sheep further, promoting a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.43, which is only 15.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach without risking the depletion of sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.97, which is only 13.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.4 to 0.35, I can maintain a balance that focuses on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring the long-term survival of both species."
