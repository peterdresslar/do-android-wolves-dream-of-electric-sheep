Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio, a moderate increase helps ensure that both populations can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, but the wolf population is also significant. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain their numbers. This approach supports a sustainable balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover and thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to ensure sustainability, as the wolf population is also growing. A small decrease from my previous theta will help maintain a healthy ecosystem without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but still below maximum capacity. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover gradually. This adjustment is in line with the wisdom of making small changes to adapt to the current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.57, which is only 28.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, ensuring that both wolves and sheep can thrive without depleting resources too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.66, which is only 23.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need to compete with other wolves."
