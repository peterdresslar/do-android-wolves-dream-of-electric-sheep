By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while ensuring the sheep population has a chance to stabilize, which is crucial for long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should remain low to allow the sheep to recover. Maintaining a lower theta will help prevent overexploitation of the sheep and ensure a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover and ensures the long-term survival of both species. It also helps to stabilize the wolf population as we adapt to the current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. This balanced approach supports long-term sustainability for both species.",

Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and my previous theta was already low. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover and prevents overexploitation, which is crucial for long-term sustainability. As the wolf population is relatively stable, focusing on competition with other wolves will help ensure our survival without depleting the sheep.",

However, I must be cautious not to overhunt, as the wolf population is still relatively small. A gradual increase allows for sustainable coexistence while ensuring that both populations can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population also present, I want to ensure we do not overhunt and deplete the sheep too quickly. A gradual increase to 0.40 allows for sustainable coexistence while still promoting wolf reproduction.",

This adjustment reflects a balance between ensuring the wolf population remains healthy and allowing the sheep to recover, while also responding to the current dynamics of the ecosystem.",

However, with the wolf population at 68, which is relatively high, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and allow both populations to thrive.",

This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly.
