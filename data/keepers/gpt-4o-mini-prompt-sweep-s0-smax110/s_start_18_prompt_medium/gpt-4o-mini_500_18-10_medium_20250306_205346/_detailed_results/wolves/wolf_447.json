            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that can sustain both populations. With the sheep at 88.8% of their maximum capacity, a balanced approach will help maintain the sheep population while allowing for some hunting to support the wolf population. This gradual adjustment will help avoid depleting the sheep too quickly and ensure long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A balanced approach is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly and to maintain a stable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while it is beneficial to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep too quickly. A moderate approach allows for both populations to thrive without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 49.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 68, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that supports both sheep recovery and wolf population health.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 37.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 70, which is relatively high, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves while allowing the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach that supports both populations without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.41, which is only 29.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is room for some hunting, I need to be cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the sustainability of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.44, which is only 23.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A moderate increase from my previous theta of 0.40 allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still considering the long-term survival of both species. It reflects a cautious approach to balance the needs of the wolf population with the recovery of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the wolf population is relatively high. A moderate approach allows for some hunting while giving sheep a chance to recover. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species without risking a crash in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.43, which is only 15.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is a need to hunt to support the wolf population, I should be cautious not to overhunt and deplete the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.97, which is only 13.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting without risking the depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.51, which is only 12.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is potential for recovery if I reduce hunting intensity slightly. A theta of 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, enabling me to maintain a sustainable coexistence while still addressing the needs of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring our population remains stable.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.53, which is only 10.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.93, which is only 9.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a balanced approach, focusing on coexistence while still allowing for some hunting to maintain the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.71, which is only 9.7% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable balance, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting intensively. This will help both populations stabilize over time."
