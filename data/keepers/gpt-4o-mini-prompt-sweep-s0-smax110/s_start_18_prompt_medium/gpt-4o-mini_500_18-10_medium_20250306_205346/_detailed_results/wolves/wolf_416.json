            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at maximum capacity, and while I need to maintain a healthy wolf population, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A moderate hunting intensity will help sustain both populations without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A moderate theta value will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can stabilize, promoting long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover. This will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem and prevent overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at its maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in sheep numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to recover, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover and ensures the long-term survival of both species. It also helps to stabilize the wolf population as we focus on competing with other wolves rather than depleting the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery and prevent depletion. Maintaining a lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep while allowing for gradual adjustments in response to future changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be cautiously increased to prevent over-depletion. However, given the current wolf population, a gradual approach is necessary to avoid destabilizing our numbers. This slight increase allows for sustainable hunting while still considering the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating a need for a slight increase in hunting intensity to maintain balance. However, given the current wolf population, I must be cautious and avoid overhunting, so a gradual increase is prudent.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is close to its maximum capacity, indicating that a slight increase in hunting intensity is appropriate to maintain balance. However, I must be cautious not to overhunt, as the wolf population is still relatively low. A gradual increase allows for sustainable coexistence while ensuring the wolf population remains healthy.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 97.73, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance of the ecosystem. This moderate adjustment helps ensure that both sheep and wolves can thrive without risking depletion or overcompetition.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain our wolf population while still enabling the sheep to recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 49.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 68, which is relatively high, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of sheep and maintaining a balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level relative to its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain their numbers. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments to ensure long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.41, which is only 29.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a moderate hunting intensity is appropriate to allow for sheep recovery while also maintaining a healthy wolf population. By slightly increasing from my previous theta of 0.40, I can take advantage of the sheep population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.44, which is only 23.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is some opportunity for hunting, it is crucial to maintain a balance to allow the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.450 to 0.40 reflects a cautious approach, allowing for sustainable coexistence while still considering the need to support the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.33, which is only 18.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem."
