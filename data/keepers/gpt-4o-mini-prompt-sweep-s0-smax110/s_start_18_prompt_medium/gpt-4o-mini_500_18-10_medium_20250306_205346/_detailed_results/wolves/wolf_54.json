            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 83.2% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain our wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still healthy at 77.75, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while maintaining a balance with the sheep population, which is currently at 70.7% of its maximum capacity. A gradual increase helps ensure sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, and while it is beneficial to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must also consider the growing wolf population. A theta of 0.40 allows for a balanced approach that supports both species without risking a rapid decline in sheep numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 43.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure our long-term survival. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still considering the need for balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level relative to the maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling wolves to maintain a healthy population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.81, which is only 25.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance and ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I need to increase my hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A gradual increase allows for a more sustainable balance as the sheep population recovers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.62, which is only 16.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.400 to 0.35, I can maintain a focus on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.10, which is only 14.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting to support our wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.07, which is only 12.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.64, which is only 11.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is an opportunity to hunt, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting sustainable coexistence while still enabling some hunting to support the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.74, which is only 10.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A gradual increase in hunting intensity is warranted, but not too aggressive, to ensure sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to increase, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.88, which is only 9.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.30 to 0.35, I can still focus on competition with other wolves while allowing for some sustainable hunting. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a balance and responding to the current state of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.83, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By focusing more on competing with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while allowing the sheep to gradually increase. A lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.91, which is only 9.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep further.
