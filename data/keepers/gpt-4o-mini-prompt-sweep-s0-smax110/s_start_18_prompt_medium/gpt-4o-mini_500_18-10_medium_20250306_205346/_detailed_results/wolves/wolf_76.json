However, with only 4 wolves, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure sustainable coexistence. A gradual increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach that supports both wolf reproduction and sheep recovery.",

To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting.",

However, I want to avoid overhunting, so a moderate increase allows for a balance that supports both our populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 97.17, allowing for a moderate hunting approach. This will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations while avoiding overhunting. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for competition with other wolves, which is necessary as the wolf population is currently at 45.00.",

This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to balance the needs of both wolves and sheep, promoting coexistence while still allowing for some reproduction among wolves.",
