            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 95.41, allowing for some increased hunting intensity without risking depletion. However, I want to avoid drastic changes, so a moderate decrease from my previous theta will help maintain balance while still allowing for wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 82.09, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still maintaining a sustainable balance with the sheep population. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.52, a slight reduction from my previous theta of 0.85 will help prevent over-depletion of the sheep, ensuring both populations can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain our wolf population while still ensuring the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. This value supports sustainable coexistence while still enabling some hunting to maintain our wolf population. It reflects a gradual adjustment to the current state of both populations, ensuring we do not over-deplete the sheep while still allowing for wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level relative to the maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. A moderate hunting intensity will allow for some sheep recovery while still enabling wolves to thrive. This approach supports sustainable coexistence and avoids depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.57, which is only 28.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a presence in the hunting cycle. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support our wolf population without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.66, which is only 23.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep population too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.17, which is only 19.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A moderate increase from my previous theta of 0.40 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.79, which is only 16.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our needs without depleting the sheep further, promoting a more balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.39, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we are competing for limited resources. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a more balanced approach to hunting while still considering the need to reduce competition among wolves. This adjustment aims to support both the wolf population and the recovery of sheep without risking overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.89, which is only 12.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.400 to 0.35, I can focus on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.89, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking their long-term survival. This adjustment will help maintain a balance as the sheep population recovers, while also ensuring the wolf population remains healthy.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.02, which is only 10.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population and maintaining a balance with the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.50, which is only 10.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.22, which is only 10.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for sustenance with the long-term health of both species."
