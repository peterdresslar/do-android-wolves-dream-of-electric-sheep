            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 55.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.93, a slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow for a more balanced approach, helping both populations stabilize while still enabling some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population also being relatively high, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 36.77, which is only 33.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is some room for hunting, I need to be cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight reduction from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still enabling some hunting to support our population."
