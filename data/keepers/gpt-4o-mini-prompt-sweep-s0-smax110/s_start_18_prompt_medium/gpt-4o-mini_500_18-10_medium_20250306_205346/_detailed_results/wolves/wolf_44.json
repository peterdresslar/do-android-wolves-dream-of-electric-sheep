            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and while it is important to maintain a healthy wolf population, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A moderate approach will help balance our needs and ensure sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 91.52, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover if needed. A moderate increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 77.75, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 57.00, I need to be cautious not to overhunt and risk depleting the sheep too quickly. A gradual increase to 0.45 allows for sustainable coexistence while still supporting wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance. This adjustment reflects the need to maintain a sustainable coexistence, as the sheep population is recovering but not yet at risk of depletion. A moderate approach will help ensure both populations can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a sustainable balance. This adjustment reflects the need to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level relative to the maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both the sheep and the wolf population while still maintaining a focus on competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.81, which is only 25.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.39, which is only 20.4% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still being cautious. A theta of 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, enabling me to hunt more effectively without depleting the sheep population too quickly. It also considers the growing wolf population, allowing for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.62, which is only 16.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a presence in the hunting cycle. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, ensuring that both populations can stabilize without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.10, which is only 14.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly, considering the current dynamics.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.07, which is only 12.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 allows for more hunting intensity while still being cautious, as the wolf population is relatively high. This balance will help maintain both populations in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.64, which is only 11.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack while prioritizing the long-term health of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.74, which is only 10.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I need to maintain some hunting to support the wolf population, I should do so cautiously to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help balance the need for hunting with the sustainability of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.11, which is only 10.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to allow the sheep to recover while still ensuring that our wolf population remains healthy. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of both species."
