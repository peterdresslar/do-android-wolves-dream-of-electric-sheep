            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 34\n- Sheep population: 110.00\n- Wolf population: 27.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.671\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 4.07 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 100.0% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at its maximum capacity, indicating that we should reduce hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population remains sustainable.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and while I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a sustainable balance. This adjustment will help support the wolf population without risking a significant depletion of sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 102.73, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 91.52, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the balance between wolves and sheep. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to ensure sustainability, as the sheep are not yet at risk of depletion. Maintaining a moderate theta allows for gradual adaptation to the current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 70.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with a wolf population of 57, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to maintain balance. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to ensure sustainability, as the wolf population is slightly high and requires some competition to stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 43.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that supports both reproduction and the recovery of sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level relative to its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly decreasing my hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both populations while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.81, which is only 25.3% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.40 helps maintain balance and allows for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.39, which is only 20.4% of its maximum capacity. While I want to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I also recognize the need to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.450 to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for some hunting while still prioritizing the sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.62, which is only 16.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased slightly, it is crucial to maintain a balance to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while also focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.10, which is only 14.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a moderate increase in hunting intensity is appropriate to help sustain the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.40 represents a slight increase from my previous value, reflecting a cautious approach to balance hunting and competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.07, which is only 12.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our wolf population without depleting the sheep further, promoting a more balanced ecosystem."
