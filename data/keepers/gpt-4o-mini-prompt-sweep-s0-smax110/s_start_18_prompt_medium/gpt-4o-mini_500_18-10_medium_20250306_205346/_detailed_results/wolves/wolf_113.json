            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we should focus on competition among wolves to ensure our population remains stable. This lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we maintain our strength.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 78.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with a relatively high sheep-to-wolf ratio and a previous theta of 0.250, I want to gradually increase my hunting intensity to ensure the wolf population remains healthy while allowing the sheep to recover. This moderate increase will help maintain balance without risking over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual increase from my previous theta aligns with the wisdom of adapting to changing conditions without risking a sudden depletion of resources.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 39.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to prevent a crash in the sheep population. A slight decrease in hunting intensity allows for a balanced approach while still enabling the wolf population to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 30.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.97, which is only 23.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is some opportunity for hunting, it is crucial to maintain a balance to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.450 to 0.40 reflects a cautious approach, allowing for sustainable coexistence while still considering the needs of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.48, which is only 18.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.400 to 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, thus promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.43, which is only 15.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.01, which is only 13.6% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help balance the ecosystem and prevent overexploitation of the sheep.",

This suggests that a lower hunting intensity is necessary to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.62, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.35 helps maintain balance and allows for sustainable coexistence.",

To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population.
