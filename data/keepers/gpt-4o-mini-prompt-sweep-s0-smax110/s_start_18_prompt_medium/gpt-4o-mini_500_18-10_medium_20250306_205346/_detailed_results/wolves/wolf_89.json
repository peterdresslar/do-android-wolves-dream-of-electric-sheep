            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. With a high sheep-to-wolf ratio, focusing on competition with other wolves will help stabilize the wolf population while giving sheep a chance to rebound.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and my previous theta was low. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual increase in theta will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep population too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to depletion of their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover while ensuring that the wolf population remains stable. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover and prevents overexploitation, ensuring long-term survival for both species. This approach also helps to avoid competition with other wolves, allowing for a more sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be cautiously increased to prevent over-depletion. However, given the current wolf population and the need to maintain balance, a moderate increase allows for sustainable coexistence while still focusing on competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that a slight increase in hunting intensity is appropriate to ensure the wolf population can thrive. However, I must be cautious and avoid drastic changes, as the wolf population is still relatively low. A gradual increase allows for sustainable coexistence while still addressing the needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 88.3% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep. This moderate adjustment helps maintain a sustainable coexistence as the wolf population is stable, and it allows for gradual adaptation to changing conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly. A gradual increase is essential to ensure sustainability.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will support wolf reproduction without overly depleting the sheep population, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 39.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure our long-term survival. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",

This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly, ensuring long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.97, which is only 23.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I can increase hunting slightly, I need to be cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate increase to 0.40 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population and maintaining a balance with the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.48, which is only 18.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.400 to 0.350, I can still maintain a balance that allows for some hunting while prioritizing the long-term survival of both species. This gradual adjustment will help avoid over-depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.43, which is only 15.8% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover.
