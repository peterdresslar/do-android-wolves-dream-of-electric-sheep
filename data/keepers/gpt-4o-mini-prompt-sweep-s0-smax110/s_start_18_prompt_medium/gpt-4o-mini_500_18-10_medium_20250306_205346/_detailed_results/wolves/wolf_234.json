            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 256\n- Sheep population: 13.89\n- Wolf population: 44.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.350\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.32 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 12.6% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and a moderate hunting intensity will allow for some sustainable coexistence while still enabling the wolf population to thrive. This gradual adjustment helps prevent over-depletion of the sheep and maintains a balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help sustain both the wolf and sheep populations while maintaining a balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. It reflects a balanced approach, responding to the current conditions without risking a sudden depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the sheep-to-wolf ratio being 1.52, it is wise to maintain a moderate hunting intensity to ensure both populations can thrive. This adjustment allows for gradual hunting while also considering the potential growth of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A moderate increase allows for a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 48.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. Given the current wolf population, a slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow for better coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.59, there is still room for cautious hunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still being mindful of the sheep population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.57, which is only 28.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight decrease in theta allows for a more balanced approach, focusing on the competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to support wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.66, which is only 23.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some reproduction among wolves while still giving sheep a chance to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep population too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.17, which is only 19.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the balance needed for both species",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.79, which is only 16.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting without risking depletion. By increasing my theta slightly from 0.35 to 0.40, I can begin to take advantage of the sheep population while still allowing for recovery and maintaining a balance with the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.39, which is only 14.0% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity slightly while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population. This moderate adjustment will help the sheep recover while keeping our pack healthy.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.89, which is only 12.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for more hunting while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep."
