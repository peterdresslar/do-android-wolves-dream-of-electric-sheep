            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. A moderate hunting intensity will allow for some sheep population control while ensuring that both species can coexist sustainably. This approach helps prevent overhunting and supports the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support the wolf population while still ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A moderate approach balances our needs with the sustainability of the ecosystem.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term survival of both species. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance as the wolf population is slightly higher than the sheep population, ensuring we do not deplete the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still ensuring that the sheep population can recover. It is important to maintain a balance and avoid overhunting, especially with the wolf population already being relatively high.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we need to be cautious with our hunting intensity. A slight decrease in theta allows for some hunting while also giving the sheep a chance to recover. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both our pack and the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.15, which is only 25.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 allows for more hunting intensity while still being cautious about the wolf population growth. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.10, which is only 20.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is potential for recovery, I need to be cautious about hunting intensity to allow the sheep to rebound. A slight decrease from my previous theta of 0.45 will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover sustainably.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.85, which is only 16.2% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 will enable me to hunt more effectively without depleting the sheep too quickly, maintaining a balance that supports both populations.",

While I want to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I need to be cautious about hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease from my previous theta will help maintain a balance while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.48, which is only 12.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for sustenance with the long-term health of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be increased slightly to ensure the wolf population can sustain itself. However, I want to avoid overhunting, so I will make a gradual adjustment to maintain balance and allow for sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.18, which is only 10.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A slight increase in hunting intensity from my previous theta of 0.4 to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence and preventing overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.67, which is only 9.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help balance the need for hunting with the necessity of not depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.32, which is only 9.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance and prevent over-depletion of the sheep, ensuring long-term survival for both species."
