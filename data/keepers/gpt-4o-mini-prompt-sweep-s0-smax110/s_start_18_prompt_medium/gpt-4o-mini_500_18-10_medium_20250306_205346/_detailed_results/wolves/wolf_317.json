            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 83.1% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover if needed. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance and avoid over-depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain our wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still promoting coexistence. This adjustment supports the wolf population without risking a rapid decline in sheep numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level relative to the maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are fewer sheep available per wolf. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I will adopt a moderate hunting intensity that allows for some hunting while still enabling the sheep population to recover. This approach balances the immediate needs of the wolf pack with the necessity of maintaining a sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.15, which is only 25.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.10, which is only 20.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly, considering the current dynamics.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.85, which is only 16.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support our wolf population without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",

This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting sustainability while still considering the current wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.48, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low at 0.28. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased slightly, it is crucial to maintain a balance to allow the sheep population to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, allowing for some hunting while prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both species.",

This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking the depletion of the sheep population, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.67, which is only 9.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is an opportunity to increase hunting intensity slightly to help sustain wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A gradual increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, avoiding overexploitation while still addressing the needs of the wolf pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.32, which is only 9.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover.
