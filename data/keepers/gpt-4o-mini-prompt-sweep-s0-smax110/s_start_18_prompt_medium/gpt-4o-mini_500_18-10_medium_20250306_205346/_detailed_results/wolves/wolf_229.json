            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. A lower theta will help balance competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to stabilize, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover and prevent overexploitation. This lower theta will help maintain a sustainable balance while avoiding competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and a moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance while allowing for some recovery of the sheep. This adjustment is gradual, ensuring that both populations can thrive without leading to a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balanced approach. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring long-term sustainability for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently healthy at 95.41, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that while there are enough sheep for hunting, I should avoid overexploitation. A slight reduction from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring both wolf and sheep populations can thrive without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly, considering the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, but the wolf population is also significant. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling us to compete effectively with other wolves. This approach helps maintain a balance and prevents over-depletion of the sheep, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.57, which is only 28.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight reduction in hunting intensity allows for a more sustainable balance, giving sheep a chance to recover while still enabling wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.66, which is only 23.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I need to be cautious about hunting too intensely, I can still afford a slight increase in hunting to support wolf reproduction. A theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still enabling some hunting to maintain our population dynamics.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.17, which is only 19.2% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, a slight increase in hunting intensity will help balance the needs of both species. This adjustment allows for sustainable coexistence while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.79, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.39, which is only 14.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further.
