            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 120\n- Sheep population: 11.03\n- Wolf population: 31.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.350\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.36 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 10.0% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 97.17, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. However, I want to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly, so I will adjust my hunting strategy gradually. This theta value reflects a balance between ensuring the wolf population can thrive while still allowing the sheep to recover and maintain their numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the sheep population at 64.1% of its maximum capacity, I can maintain a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This adjustment allows for sustainable coexistence without risking a depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 51.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 67.00, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure that both populations can thrive. A moderate increase in theta allows for some hunting while still considering the long-term balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 39.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, it's wise to maintain a balanced approach to avoid over-depleting the sheep while ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. A slight reduction from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach, promoting coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term survival for both.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.97, which is only 23.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still giving sheep a chance to recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.48, which is only 18.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the immediate needs of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.43, which is only 15.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a lower hunting intensity is necessary to allow the sheep to recover. Additionally, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.31, focusing more on competition with other wolves will help stabilize our population while giving the sheep a chance to increase. A gradual adjustment to 0.35 reflects a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.01, which is only 13.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.46, which is only 12.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing our own wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack without depleting the sheep further, promoting a balance that supports long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.29, which is only 11.2% of its maximum capacity. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.31, it is crucial to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while also preventing a crash in the wolf population due to overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.62, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should maintain a cautious approach to hunting, allowing the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting to support our wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 reflects a small adjustment to adapt to the current conditions without risking a rapid depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.03, which is only 10.0% of its maximum capacity. Given the high wolf population of 31.00, it is wise to focus on competition among wolves rather than intense hunting of sheep. This will allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem."
