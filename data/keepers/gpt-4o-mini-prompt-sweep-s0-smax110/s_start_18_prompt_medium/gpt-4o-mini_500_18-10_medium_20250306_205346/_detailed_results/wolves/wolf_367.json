            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that they are vulnerable to overhunting. A moderate hunting intensity will allow for some reproduction among wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover. This balance is crucial for the long-term survival of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is near its maximum capacity, indicating that a more moderate hunting intensity is appropriate to allow for recovery while still supporting our wolf population. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that can support wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This approach balances the needs of both populations and avoids overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 72.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.43, it is important to maintain a balance to prevent overhunting and ensure the long-term survival of both species. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain the wolf population while still ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 47.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 67, I need to be cautious about over-hunting. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain a healthy population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 39.89, which is only 36.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for more hunting to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious about the sheep population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 30.85, which is only 28.0% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta value of 0.35 allows for some hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly, fostering a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.21, which is only 22.0% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.35 reflects a balanced approach to ensure both species can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.24, which is only 17.5% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population, a moderate approach is necessary. This theta value reflects a slight increase in hunting intensity compared to my previous value, acknowledging the need to adapt to the current conditions without overexploiting the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.60, which is only 15.1% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting to support wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.39, which is only 13.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.67, which is only 11.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing our wolf population. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity and promote a more sustainable balance between the two populations, ensuring long-term survival."
