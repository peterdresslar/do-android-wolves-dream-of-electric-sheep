            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This approach balances our needs with the sustainability of the ecosystem, avoiding overhunting and allowing for a gradual adjustment as conditions change.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery. A moderate increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, avoiding overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, and the wolf population is relatively high. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling wolves to maintain their numbers. This approach supports sustainable coexistence and avoids depleting the sheep population too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly, as the sheep population is recovering. A gradual increase is prudent to avoid sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.57, which is only 28.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to allow for recovery. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of both populations, especially given the relatively high wolf population of 69. This approach helps maintain balance and prevents overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.66, which is only 23.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.35 to 0.40, I can help ensure the wolf population remains healthy while still allowing the sheep to recover over time.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.17, which is only 19.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to be cautious with our hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both populations. It also helps to prevent competition among wolves from becoming too intense, which could further destabilize our numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.79, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a need for cautious hunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.39, which is only 14.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support our needs without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.89, which is only 12.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the immediate needs of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.89, which is only 11.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still being mindful of the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.02, which is only 10.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack without depleting the sheep further, promoting a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.50, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring both can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.22, which is only 10.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is potential for recovery if I reduce hunting intensity slightly. By increasing theta from 0.4 to 0.45, I can still maintain some hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing sheep numbers to stabilize and grow. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.08, which is only 10.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta value of 0.35 strikes a balance between competing with other wolves and allowing the sheep population to stabilize, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.10, which is only 10.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is potential for recovery in the sheep population. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity to 0.40, I can maintain a balance that allows for sustainable coexistence while still being mindful of the wolf population, which is currently at 21.00. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of responding to changing conditions without causing drastic fluctuations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.24, which is only 10.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for wolf reproduction with the sustainability of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.54, which is only 10.5% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will enable me to hunt more effectively while still prioritizing the sustainability of both species."
