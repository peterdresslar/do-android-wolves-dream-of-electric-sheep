            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A theta of 0.4 strikes a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can stabilize, promoting long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and prevent over-depletion of the sheep, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. With a higher sheep-to-wolf ratio, focusing on competition among wolves will help maintain our population while ensuring the sheep can rebound.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between the wolf and sheep populations, ensuring both can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 92.6% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term survival for both.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 91.38, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep. This moderate adjustment helps ensure sustainability and allows for some growth in the wolf population without over-depleting the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, I must remain cautious and avoid overhunting, as the wolf population is also significant. A gradual increase will help maintain balance without risking depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term survival of both species. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance as the wolf population is also relatively high, ensuring we do not deplete the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still considering the need for the sheep to recover. A gradual increase is essential to avoid over-depleting the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 36.77, which is only 33.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should maintain a moderate hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while still ensuring our wolf population remains healthy. A slight decrease from my previous theta will help balance our needs and the ecosystem",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.15, which is only 25.6% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A moderate increase from my previous theta of 0.40 reflects a balanced approach to ensure both populations can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.10, which is only 20.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some reproduction among wolves while still giving sheep a chance to recover. A slight decrease from my previous theta of 0.45 will help maintain a balance and avoid depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.85, which is only 16.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to allow for recovery. A moderate increase to 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low at 15.40, which is only 14.0% of its maximum capacity. While I need to maintain a balance, a slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted to ensure my pack can thrive. However, I must be cautious and avoid drastic changes, as the wolf population is relatively high at 53.00. A moderate increase to 0.40 allows for sustainable hunting while still considering the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.48, which is only 12.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population.
