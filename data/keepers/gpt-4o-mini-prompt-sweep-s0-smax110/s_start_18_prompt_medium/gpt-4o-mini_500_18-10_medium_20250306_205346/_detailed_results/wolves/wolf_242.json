            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is close to its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction without risking a significant depletion of the sheep population. It is a moderate approach that aligns with the current dynamics of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to maintain balance, considering the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still above 74% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. However, with the wolf population at 54, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to maintain balance. A gradual increase to 0.45 allows for sustainable coexistence while still focusing on the health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 67.18, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a slight abundance of sheep. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.40, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover further. This gradual adjustment supports long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.59, it indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. This slight decrease from my previous theta will help balance the needs of both populations while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.57, which is only 28.7% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.66, which is only 23.3% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still being cautious. A moderate increase to 0.40 will help maintain a balance between hunting and allowing the sheep population to recover, ensuring the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.17, which is only 19.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly, considering the current trends.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.79, which is only 16.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population and maintaining a balance with the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.39, which is only 14.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased slightly to support wolf reproduction, it is crucial to do so gradually to avoid depleting the sheep further. A theta of 0.40 allows for a modest increase in hunting while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.89, which is only 12.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for wolf survival while giving sheep a chance to increase their numbers. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.89, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a balance, allowing for some growth in the wolf population while still being cautious not to overhunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.02, which is only 10.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of both species."
