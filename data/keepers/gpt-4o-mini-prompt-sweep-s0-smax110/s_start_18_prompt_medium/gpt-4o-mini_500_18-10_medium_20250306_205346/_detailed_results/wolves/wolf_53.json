            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 91.52, allowing for some increased hunting intensity without risking depletion. However, I want to avoid overhunting, especially since the wolf population is also significant. A moderate increase in theta will help maintain a balance while ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual adjustment is key to maintaining balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance and avoid over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 43.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. However, with a wolf population of 69, we need to be cautious about overhunting. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for some hunting to support our reproduction while also giving sheep a chance to recover and maintain a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A slight decrease in hunting will help maintain a balance, ensuring both sheep and wolves can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.81, which is only 25.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly. A small increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring both species can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.39, which is only 20.4% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.62, which is only 16.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should prioritize allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support our wolf population, but it also emphasizes the need for balance and sustainability in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.10, which is only 14.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need to adapt to the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.07, which is only 12.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is a need for the sheep to recover. By setting a slightly lower theta, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize while still maintaining some hunting to support our pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.64, which is only 11.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.11, which is only 10.1% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting intensively. This will help maintain the balance and prevent the sheep population from depleting further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.88, which is only 9.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining some hunting to support our wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while being mindful of the need for gradual adjustments.",

This suggests that we should be cautious with our hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for some hunting while still prioritizing the sustainability of both populations."
