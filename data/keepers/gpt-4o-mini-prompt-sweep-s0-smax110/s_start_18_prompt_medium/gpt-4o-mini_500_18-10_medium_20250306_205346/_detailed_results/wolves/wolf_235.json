            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing sheep to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 95.41, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This balance helps maintain sustainable coexistence as we adapt to the current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.52, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and I want to maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a more cautious approach, ensuring that the sheep can recover while still allowing for some hunting to support the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both species. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to ensure that the sheep can recover while we maintain a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring both populations can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.57, which is only 28.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the long-term balance and survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.66, which is only 23.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.35 to 0.40, I can focus on hunting while still allowing for the sheep population to recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and responding to the current state of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.17, which is only 19.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while maintaining a stable wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 will help balance our hunting needs with the necessity of sustaining the sheep population, avoiding overhunting and ensuring long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.79, which is only 16.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I can increase my hunting intensity slightly, I must be cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still giving sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.39, which is only 14.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support our wolf population without risking a drastic decline in the sheep population, ensuring a more sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.89, which is only 12.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to allow the sheep to recover before increasing our hunting intensity. By focusing on competition with other wolves at a lower theta, we can help stabilize our wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to rebound.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring that both populations can recover sustainably."
