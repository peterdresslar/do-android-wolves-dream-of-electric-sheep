            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 188\n- Sheep population: 13.64\n- Wolf population: 43.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.350\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.32 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 12.4% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. A slight reduction in hunting intensity allows for the sheep to recover while still enabling wolves to maintain their numbers. This moderate approach helps ensure a sustainable balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still healthy and close to its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, I must remain cautious and avoid overhunting, as the wolf population is also significant. A gradual increase will help maintain balance and ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 94.75, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 46.00, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 81.59, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the balance between wolf and sheep populations. This moderate adjustment will help maintain sustainability as the sheep population is at 74.2% of its maximum capacity, and it allows for gradual adaptation to the changing conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must do so gradually to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that considers both the current sheep population and the need for wolf growth.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 46.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 68, which is relatively high compared to the sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves while allowing the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance that supports both populations without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 39.68, which is only 36.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some replenishment of the sheep while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting sustainability without risking a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.00, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we are nearing a critical point for sustainable hunting. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while still competing with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.67, which is only 22.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.12, which is only 18.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is some room for hunting, it is crucial to avoid overexploitation to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for some hunting while prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.25, which is only 15.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the immediate needs of the pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.13, which is only 13.8% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover while still ensuring the wolf population remains stable, a moderate hunting intensity is appropriate. This will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep, promoting long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.64, which is only 12.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach to hunting while still being cautious about the wolf population growth."
