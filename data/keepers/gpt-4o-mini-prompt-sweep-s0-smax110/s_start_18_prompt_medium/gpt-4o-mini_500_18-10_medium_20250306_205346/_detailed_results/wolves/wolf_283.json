            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment reflects a balance between maintaining a healthy wolf population and ensuring the sheep can recover. A gradual increase is prudent as it aligns with the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and promotes coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.15, which is only 25.6% of its maximum capacity. While I want to ensure the wolves can thrive, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.10, which is only 20.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.85, which is only 16.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is some opportunity for hunting, it is crucial to avoid overexploitation to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the balance needed for both populations to thrive."
