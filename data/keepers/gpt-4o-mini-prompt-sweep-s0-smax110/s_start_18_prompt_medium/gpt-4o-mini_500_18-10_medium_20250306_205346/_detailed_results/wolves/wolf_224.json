            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 254\n- Sheep population: 17.79\n- Wolf population: 54.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.400\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.33 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 16.2% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that we should moderate our hunting intensity to allow for recovery while still ensuring our own survival. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance as we adapt to the current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that we should reduce hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta will help maintain a balance between our population and the sheep, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while ensuring the sheep have a chance to rebound. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover and ensures that the wolf population can sustain itself without risking a crash in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that a slight increase in hunting intensity is appropriate to maintain balance. However, I must be cautious and avoid drastic changes, as the wolf population is still relatively low. A gradual increase allows for sustainable coexistence while ensuring that both populations can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a sustainable balance. This adjustment will help support the wolf population without risking a rapid depletion of sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 95.41, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, the wolf population is also significant at 46.00, so I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A gradual increase to 0.45 strikes a balance between sustaining the sheep population and allowing for wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, but it is important to avoid overhunting as the wolf population is also significant. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, but the wolf population is also significant. A slight decrease in hunting intensity allows for a more sustainable balance, giving sheep a chance to recover while still ensuring our pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for some increased hunting without risking depletion. However, with the wolf population also being relatively high, a slight reduction in hunting intensity is prudent to ensure our numbers remain stable. This adjustment promotes a sustainable balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.57, which is only 28.7% of its maximum capacity. While I want to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to stabilize and grow, while still enabling some reproduction among wolves. This moderate approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.66, which is only 23.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain its health. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves, which will help stabilize the wolf population without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.17, which is only 19.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.79, which is only 16.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to allow for recovery. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both sheep and wolves."
