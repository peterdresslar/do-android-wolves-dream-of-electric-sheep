            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 402\n- Sheep population: 10.70\n- Wolf population: 30.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.350\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.36 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 9.7% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 84.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with the wolf population at 47, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves to ensure our long-term survival. A theta of 0.25 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the stability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both species. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance as the sheep population is recovering, while also considering the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment reflects a balanced approach, considering the sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need for gradual changes to maintain ecosystem stability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 47.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 67, which is relatively high compared to the sheep, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level (36.3% of maximum capacity), and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are not enough sheep to support aggressive hunting. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while still competing with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 30.85, which is only 28.0% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I also want to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help me maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.21, which is only 22.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that I can afford to increase my hunting intensity slightly to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A gradual increase to 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.24, which is only 17.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it is crucial to maintain a balance to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.60, which is only 15.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still being mindful of the need to compete with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.39, which is only 13.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting sustainability without risking a rapid decline in sheep numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.67, which is only 11.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack without depleting the sheep further, promoting a healthier balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to increase. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.14, which is only 10.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still giving sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and my previous theta was already on the lower end. A slight increase to 0.40 allows for a more balanced approach to hunting while still being cautious, as the wolf population is relatively high. This adjustment will help maintain the sheep population and ensure sustainable coexistence."
