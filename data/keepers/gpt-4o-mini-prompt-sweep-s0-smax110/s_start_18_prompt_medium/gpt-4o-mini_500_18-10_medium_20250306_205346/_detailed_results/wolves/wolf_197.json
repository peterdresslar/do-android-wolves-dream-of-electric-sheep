            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 180\n- Sheep population: 66.52\n- Wolf population: 62.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.111\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 1.07 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 60.5% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.07, it is crucial to maintain a balance to avoid overhunting and ensure the long-term survival of both species. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while also enabling the sheep population to recover and sustain itself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a sustainable balance. This adjustment will help support the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly, as they are recovering from previous pressures.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. Given the wolf population is also relatively high, a moderate approach will help maintain balance while still allowing for some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low relative to the maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain their numbers. This approach supports a sustainable balance without risking a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.67, which is only 22.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for moderate hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.12, which is only 18.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This gradual approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.25, which is only 15.7% of its maximum capacity.

A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.13, which is only 13.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus slightly more on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting. This approach helps maintain a balance, ensuring that both the sheep and wolf populations can stabilize and thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.64, which is only 12.4% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. A gradual increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.61, which is only 11.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.400 to 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring a balance that promotes the long-term survival of both species.",

It also considers the need to adapt to the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.12, which is only 10.1% of its maximum capacity.

A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our wolf population without depleting the sheep further, promoting a balanced ecosystem.",

With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.53, it is crucial to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.43, which is only 10.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to be cautious with our hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach, enabling some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term survival of both species. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively low at 11.73, which suggests that a slight increase in hunting intensity is appropriate to ensure the wolf population can sustain itself. However, I must be cautious and avoid overhunting, as the sheep population is still recovering. A gradual increase allows for a balanced approach while considering the current dynamics.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.10, which is only 11.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover.
