A moderate theta value will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring long-term sustainability.",

With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 6.11, focusing more on competition with other wolves will help stabilize our population while giving the sheep a chance to rebound.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",

Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance.",

This moderate adjustment allows for sustainable coexistence while still considering the need for gradual changes.",

This adjustment helps ensure the wolf population remains healthy while still allowing sheep to recover. A gradual increase is essential to maintain balance and avoid sudden crashes.",

A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling us to compete effectively with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
