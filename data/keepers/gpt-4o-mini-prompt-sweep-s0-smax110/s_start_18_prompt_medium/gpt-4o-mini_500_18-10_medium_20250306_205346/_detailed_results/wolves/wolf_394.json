            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain the wolf population while still ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, but I need to be cautious as the wolf population is also significant. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help sustain the wolf population while allowing for some recovery in the sheep numbers. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a balance between the wolf and sheep populations, ensuring both can thrive without depleting resources too quickly. A gradual approach is essential to avoid sudden population crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level (28.0% of maximum capacity), and while we need to ensure our hunting supports wolf reproduction, we must also allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.50 maintains a balance that encourages coexistence while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.21, which is only 22.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.40 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population and maintaining a balance with the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.24, which is only 17.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on the competition with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.60, which is only 15.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.39, which is only 13.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted, but a more moderate approach will help maintain balance and prevent over-depletion of sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.67, which is only 11.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for wolves to reproduce.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.67, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep population while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our own health. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for a gradual approach to hunting, ensuring that we do not deplete the sheep further while still competing effectively with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low at 11.14, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking over-depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a balance as the sheep population recovers while also supporting the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.70, which is only 9.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing our own population. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance and ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.50, which is only 9.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will enable me to maintain a balance between hunting and allowing the sheep population to stabilize, while also considering the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.45, which is only 9.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.53, which is only 9.6% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.80, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a presence in the hunting aspect. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 to 0.35 reflects a cautious approach to balance competition with other wolves and the need to let the sheep population stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively low at 11.09, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.41, which is only 10.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is an opportunity for hunting, it is essential to prioritize the recovery of the sheep population to ensure long-term sustainability. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, which is necessary given the current wolf population."
