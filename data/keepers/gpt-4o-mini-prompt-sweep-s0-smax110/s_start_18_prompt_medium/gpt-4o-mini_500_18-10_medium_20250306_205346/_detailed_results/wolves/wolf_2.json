This will help maintain the balance between wolves and sheep while ensuring that both populations can thrive. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for cautious hunting, considering the current wolf population and the need to avoid over-depletion of sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep do not deplete too quickly. A gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 18.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with a wolf population of 9.00, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 19.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. A moderate theta of 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, enabling me to maintain a sustainable coexistence while being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. This adjustment also considers the current wolf population, which is stable but could be affected by overhunting."
