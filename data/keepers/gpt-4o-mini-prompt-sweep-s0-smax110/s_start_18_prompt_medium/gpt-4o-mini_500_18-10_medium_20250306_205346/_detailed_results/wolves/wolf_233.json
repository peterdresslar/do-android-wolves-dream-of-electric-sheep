            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 256\n- Sheep population: 13.89\n- Wolf population: 44.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.350\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.32 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 12.6% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to prevent depletion. A theta of 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, ensuring that we can sustain both our wolf population and the sheep, while still allowing for some hunting to support reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is very close to its maximum capacity, indicating that we should be cautious with our hunting intensity. A slight reduction from my previous theta allows for a more balanced approach, giving sheep a chance to recover while still enabling wolves to thrive. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover and sustain their numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently healthy, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep do not deplete too quickly. A balanced approach at this stage will support both species in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must also be cautious not to deplete the sheep too quickly. A slight reduction from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring both populations can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while it is beneficial to maintain some hunting to support wolf reproduction, I need to be cautious about over-depleting the sheep. A slight reduction in hunting intensity allows for a more balanced approach, ensuring both populations can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term sustainability while still allowing for some growth in the wolf pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level (36.8% of maximum capacity), and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while still competing with other wolves. This moderate approach will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a more balanced approach, ensuring both populations can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.66, which is only 23.3% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 will help me maintain a balance between hunting and allowing the sheep to thrive, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.17, which is only 19.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting to sustain the wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.39, which is only 14.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for wolves to compete with each other while still allowing for some hunting to support reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.89, which is only 12.6% of its maximum capacity. While I need to focus on hunting to ensure the survival of my pack, I must also consider the sustainability of the sheep population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for more hunting while still being cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. This approach supports both my pack"
