            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and my previous theta was quite low. By increasing it to 0.3, I can focus on a balanced approach that allows for some hunting while still enabling the sheep population to recover and thrive. This will help maintain a healthy ecosystem and prevent over-depletion of sheep, ensuring long-term survival for both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population being relatively high, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.41, which is only 29.5% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting sheep. This will allow the sheep population to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.44, which is only 23.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I need to maintain a focus on hunting to support my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.33, which is only 18.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that the sheep need time to recover, and a lower hunting intensity will allow for their population to stabilize. Additionally, with a wolf population of 61, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.43, which is only 15.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for more hunting intensity while still being cautious, as the wolf population is relatively high. This approach aims to balance the needs of both wolves and sheep, ensuring long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.97, which is only 13.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 to 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for wolf population sustainability while allowing the sheep to regain numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.51, which is only 12.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some reproduction among wolves while still giving sheep a chance to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep population too quickly.",

This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring a balance that promotes long-term sustainability for both populations.",

A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still being mindful of the need to avoid overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.55, which is only 9.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of both populations. It also helps to avoid competition among wolves as the population is relatively high.",

This suggests that we should be cautious with our hunting to allow the sheep to recover. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.51, there is still a need for some hunting to support our wolf population.

This suggests that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow the sheep to recover.
