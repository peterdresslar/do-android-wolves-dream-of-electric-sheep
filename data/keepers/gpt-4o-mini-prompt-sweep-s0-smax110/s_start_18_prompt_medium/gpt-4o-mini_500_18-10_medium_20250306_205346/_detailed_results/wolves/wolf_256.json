            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is necessary to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly, and this theta reflects a balanced approach to coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still maintaining a sustainable balance with the sheep population. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the fact that the sheep population is recovering, a gradual increase in hunting will help ensure both species can thrive without risking overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 48.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 67, which is relatively high compared to the sheep, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for a balanced approach that supports both sheep recovery and wolf population stability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 36.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a wolf population of 69, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is low, suggesting that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover while still competing with other wolves. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.57, which is only 28.7% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting to support reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.66, which is only 23.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our wolf population. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, ensuring the long-term survival of both species without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.17, which is only 19.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for gradual hunting to help sustain the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.79, which is only 16.2% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase in hunting intensity to 0.45 will help maintain a balance, allowing for some reproduction among wolves while still being mindful of the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.39, which is only 14.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population and maintaining a balance with the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.89, which is only 12.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting without risking the depletion of the sheep. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.35 to 0.40, I can maintain a balanced approach that allows for some hunting while still considering the long-term sustainability of both populations. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of adapting to changing conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.89, which is only 11.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support our wolf population without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.02, which is only 10.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to be cautious with our hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach that acknowledges the need for sustainable coexistence while still allowing for some hunting to support the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.50, which is only 10.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A moderate decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance and prevent overexploitation of the sheep, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.22, which is only 10.2% of its maximum capacity.

This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.4 to 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.10, which is only 10.1% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to help sustain the wolf population while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.35 aligns with the wisdom of making small adjustments to maintain balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.24, which is only 10.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover.
