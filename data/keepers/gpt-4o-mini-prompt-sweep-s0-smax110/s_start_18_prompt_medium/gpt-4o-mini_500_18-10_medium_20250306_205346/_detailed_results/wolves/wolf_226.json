            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. A lower theta will help balance competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to stabilize, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at its maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery and prevent depletion. Maintaining a lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep while allowing us to adapt to future changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that a slight increase in hunting intensity is appropriate to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is close to its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a sustainable balance. This adjustment will help support the wolf population without over-depleting the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still healthy at 95.41, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while ensuring that we do not over-deplete their numbers. This adjustment reflects a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction without jeopardizing the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, but I want to ensure that we do not deplete their numbers too quickly. A slight reduction in hunting intensity allows for a sustainable coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves. This approach also considers the current wolf population, which is relatively stable, and avoids sudden changes that could disrupt the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual increase is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 48.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.79, it is important to maintain a balance that allows both populations to thrive. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help the sheep recover while still allowing for some hunting to support the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery. A gradual increase helps maintain balance and avoids sudden shifts that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.57, which is only 28.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our needs without depleting the sheep further, promoting a healthier balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.66, which is only 23.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.35 to 0.40, I can focus on hunting while still allowing for the sheep population to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.17, which is only 19.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a more balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the long-term health of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.79, which is only 16.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.39, which is only 14.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting without risking the sheep"
