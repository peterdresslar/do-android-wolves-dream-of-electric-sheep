            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 320\n- Sheep population: 76.80\n- Wolf population: 60.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.424\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 1.28 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 69.8% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.15, which is only 25.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a focus on competition with other wolves, which can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.10, which is only 20.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly.

While I need to maintain a balance to ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, a slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted to take advantage of the current sheep population without depleting it too quickly.
