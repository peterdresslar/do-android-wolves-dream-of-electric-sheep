            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A value of 0.45 strikes a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability while avoiding over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing our own numbers. A lower theta will help us compete with other wolves without depleting the sheep further, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. With a high sheep-to-wolf ratio, focusing on competition among wolves will help maintain our population while giving sheep a chance to rebound.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution in hunting to prevent depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring a balanced approach that promotes long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover and prevent overexploitation. This lower theta will help maintain a balance while avoiding competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at its maximum capacity, indicating that we should be cautious with our hunting to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without drastically depleting the sheep population, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 93.4% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 91.52, allowing for a moderate hunting approach. This will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can recover. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach as the wolf population is also significant, promoting sustainability without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery. A gradual increase is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, but the wolf population is also significant. A moderate theta allows for sustainable hunting while ensuring that both populations can thrive. This approach helps prevent overhunting and supports the long-term balance of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 43.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level relative to its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A slight decrease in hunting will help maintain a balance, ensuring both sheep and wolf populations can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.81, which is only 25.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for wolf reproduction with the sustainability of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.39, which is only 20.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach while still being mindful of the need for coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.62, which is only 16.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.400 to 0.35, I can focus on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, promoting a sustainable balance."
