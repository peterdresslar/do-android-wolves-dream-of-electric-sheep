            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at nearly 50% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for cautious hunting to allow for recovery. With the wolf population also being relatively high, a lower theta will help reduce competition among wolves while still allowing for some hunting of sheep. This approach supports long-term sustainability and avoids depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 41.65, and the wolf population is relatively high at 70.00. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover. A moderate theta of 0.30 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.41, which is only 29.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is potential for recovery in the sheep population. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly to 0.40, I can still support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep to recover without depleting their numbers too quickly. This moderate approach aligns with my goal of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.44, which is only 23.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I can increase my hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate increase to 0.45 allows for a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring both populations can recover sustainably.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.33, which is only 18.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that the sheep need some time to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This gradual adjustment helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.43, which is only 15.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still being mindful of the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.97, which is only 13.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.51, which is only 12.3% of its maximum capacity.
