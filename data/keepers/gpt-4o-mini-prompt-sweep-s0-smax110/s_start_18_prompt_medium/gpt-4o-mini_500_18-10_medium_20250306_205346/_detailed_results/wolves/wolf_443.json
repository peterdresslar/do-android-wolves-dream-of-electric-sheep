            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 88.8% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that can support wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep population has room to recover. This adjustment reflects a balanced approach, responding to the current conditions without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still healthy at 86.23, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction without risking a significant depletion of the sheep population. It reflects a cautious approach to ensure sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while I want to ensure my pack thrives, I also need to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate approach will help maintain balance and prevent overhunting, which could lead to future scarcity.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 49.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 68, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 41.65, which is only 37.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some reproduction among wolves while still giving sheep a chance to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 29.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 70, it is wise to focus slightly more on competition among wolves to prevent overhunting and allow the sheep to recover. A gradual adjustment towards a lower theta will help maintain a balance while ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.44, which is only 23.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I need to maintain some hunting to support the wolf population, I should be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.33, which is only 18.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for the sheep to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus more on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.43, which is only 15.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without over-depleting the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.97, which is only 13.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our wolf population without depleting the sheep further, promoting a more balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.51, which is only 12.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for more hunting to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious about the sheep population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.24, which is only 11.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring that both populations can recover sustainably.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.53, which is only 10.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more moderate hunting intensity is appropriate to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain its health. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help balance the need for hunting with the sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.93, which is only 9.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still focusing on the competition with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance."
