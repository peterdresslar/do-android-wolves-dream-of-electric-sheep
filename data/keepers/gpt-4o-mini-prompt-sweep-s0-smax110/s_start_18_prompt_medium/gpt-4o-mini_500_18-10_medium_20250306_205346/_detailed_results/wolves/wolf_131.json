            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 109\n- Sheep population: 70.52\n- Wolf population: 61.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.386\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 1.16 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 64.1% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is necessary to avoid over-depletion of the sheep, keeping in mind the balance needed for long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for some hunting without risking depletion. Given the wolf population is also relatively high, a slight reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and allow both populations to stabilize. This approach aligns with the wisdom of making gradual adjustments to ensure sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 39.6% of its maximum capacity, which indicates that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.97, which is only 23.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach, promoting sustainability without risking a rapid depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.48, which is only 18.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing our own population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our needs without depleting the sheep further, promoting a balance that can lead to long-term coexistence.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.01, which is only 13.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A gradual adjustment towards a lower theta will help balance our needs with the sustainability of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.46, which is only 12.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some reproduction among wolves while still enabling the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting sustainability without risking a crash in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.29, which is only 11.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate approach allows for some hunting while still enabling the sheep population to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.62, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we are competing for limited resources. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a bit more hunting to support our population while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep too quickly. This approach aims for a sustainable balance as we adapt to the current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.0% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. A lower theta allows me to focus on competing with other wolves, which will help stabilize the wolf population while giving sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.86, which is only 9.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should be cautious in our hunting to allow the sheep to recover. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.39, there is still some competition among wolves. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach that supports both wolf reproduction and sheep recovery without risking a dramatic depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.65, which is only 9.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and allowing the sheep population to stabilize, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.71, which is only 9.7% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.96, which is only 10.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a slight hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A small increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach that respects the need for sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.23, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a balance as the sheep population recovers while also considering the growing wolf population. A gradual increase is essential to avoid sudden impacts on the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.56, which is only 10.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring a balance that supports both populations in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I need to ensure my own survival and that of the wolf pack, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance, allowing for sustainable hunting while avoiding over-depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.48, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking over-depletion. This moderate adjustment helps maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can recover.
