            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 78.1% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain our wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover if needed. A gradual adjustment is key to maintaining balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep do not deplete too quickly. A gradual adjustment allows us to respond to the current trends without risking a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 51.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 67, which is relatively high compared to the sheep, I need to be cautious not to overhunt and deplete the sheep too quickly. A slight reduction from my previous theta allows for continued hunting while promoting coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 39.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, which is relatively high, I need to be cautious and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring both populations can thrive without leading to a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 30.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting, which could lead to a crash in the sheep population. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring both populations can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.97, which is only 23.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I can increase my hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A moderate increase to 0.45 allows for some hunting while still considering the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.48, which is only 18.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is some opportunity for hunting, it is crucial to allow the sheep population to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both species. This approach helps maintain a balance as the wolf population is relatively high.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.43, which is only 15.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I need to maintain some hunting to support the wolf population, I should be cautious not to overhunt and risk depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach that supports both the wolf population and the recovery of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.01, which is only 13.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is some opportunity for hunting, it is crucial to avoid overexploitation to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring both populations can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.46, which is only 12.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while ensuring that the sheep population has the opportunity to grow, promoting a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.29, which is only 11.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should not increase hunting intensity too much, as it could lead to further depletion of the sheep. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.03, which is only 10% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus more on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This gradual adjustment helps maintain a balance between our populations without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.86, which is only 9.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is an opportunity to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A small increase to 0.40 maintains a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.65, which is only 9.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, reducing hunting intensity while still competing with other wolves to maintain our numbers."
