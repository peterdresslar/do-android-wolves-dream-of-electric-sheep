This adjustment reflects a balanced approach, considering the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need for gradual changes in strategy.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 39.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 30.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.97, which is only 23.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing our own population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack while prioritizing the long-term balance of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.48, which is only 18.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the immediate needs of the pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.43, which is only 15.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance and ensure the long-term survival of both species.",

A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance, encouraging sustainable hunting while avoiding over-depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.46, which is only 12.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for wolf survival while ensuring the sheep population can stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.29, which is only 11.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is an opportunity to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A gradual increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, considering both the need for wolves to thrive and the importance of not depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.62, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still considering the need for sustainable hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at only 10.0% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain a balance and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.86, which is only 9.9% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will enable me to maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.65, which is only 9.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to be cautious with our hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a bit more hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between our populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.71, which is only 9.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing our need for sustenance with the necessity of preserving the sheep population for future cycles.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.96, which is only 10.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the immediate needs of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.23, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion.
