A moderate approach will help maintain balance and prevent depletion of the sheep, while still allowing for some hunting to support the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and hunting them aggressively could lead to depletion. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a healthy wolf population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that they are vulnerable to overhunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of sheep and maintaining a balance with the wolf population. This approach supports sustainable coexistence.",

A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep.",

A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on the competition with other wolves, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 4.58, it is crucial to focus on competition among wolves to prevent overhunting and ensure long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover while keeping the wolf population stable, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",

A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that a slight increase in hunting intensity is appropriate to maintain balance. However, given the current wolf population and the need to avoid over-depletion of sheep, I will only make a small adjustment to ensure sustainable coexistence.",

This adjustment supports wolf reproduction without overly depleting the sheep, ensuring both populations can thrive in the long term.",

This approach balances the needs of both populations and avoids over-depletion of the sheep.",

This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still maintaining a balance with the sheep population. A gradual increase is prudent as it aligns with the current trends and avoids sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
