            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 189\n- Sheep population: 12.61\n- Wolf population: 38.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.400\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.33 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 11.5% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while maintaining a sustainable balance with the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining balance and responding to the current state of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 81.59, allowing for a moderate hunting approach. This will help maintain a balance between the wolf and sheep populations, ensuring sustainability while also allowing for some reproduction among wolves. Gradually adjusting my hunting intensity will help avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting approach. This will help maintain the balance between wolves and sheep while also considering the gradual increase in sheep numbers. A slight reduction from my previous theta will help ensure that we do not over-deplete the sheep population as we adapt to the current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to ensure that both populations can thrive without depleting resources too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a balance as the sheep population is recovering, while also considering the growing wolf population. A gradual increase in hunting will support our needs without leading to a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low relative to the wolf population, indicating a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease from my previous theta will help maintain balance while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.67, which is only 22.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for moderate hunting without risking depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach to hunting while still considering the need for sustainable coexistence. It reflects a cautious optimism about the sheep population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.12, which is only 18.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is some opportunity for hunting, it is crucial to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.25, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a need for cautious hunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still being mindful of the sheep population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.13, which is only 13.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta will help balance our needs without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.64, which is only 12.4% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.35 aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and responding to the current state of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.61, which is only 11.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for the sheep to recover. By adopting a slightly lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem."
