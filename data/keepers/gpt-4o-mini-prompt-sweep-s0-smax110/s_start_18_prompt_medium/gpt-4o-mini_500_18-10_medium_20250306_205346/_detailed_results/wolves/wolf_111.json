            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 107\n- Sheep population: 97.17\n- Wolf population: 45.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.300\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 2.16 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 88.3% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can still recover. A gradual increase in theta allows for a sustainable balance, avoiding overhunting while still benefiting from the current sheep numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 85.86, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still maintaining a sustainable balance with the sheep population. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio, a moderate increase is prudent to ensure both populations can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, but the wolf population is also significant. A moderate approach allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some hunting to support wolf reproduction. This gradual adjustment helps avoid depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring both populations can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a sustainable balance. This adjustment reflects the need to support the wolf population without over-depleting the sheep, ensuring long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 39.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 30.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to prevent a crash in the sheep population. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for more hunting while still maintaining a balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.97, which is only 23.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I need to maintain some hunting to support wolf reproduction, I should also be cautious to allow the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while being mindful of the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.48, which is only 18.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, reducing hunting intensity while still competing with other wolves. This will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.43, which is only 15.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.35 to 0.40, I can help ensure the wolf population remains healthy while still allowing for some recovery of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.01, which is only 13.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.4 to 0.35, I can maintain a focus on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring a balance that supports both populations in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.46, which is only 12.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.29, which is only 11.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.4 to 0.35, I can focus on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring a balance that supports both populations in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity to ensure the survival of my pack, I must do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that can support both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.03, which is only 10.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance and prevent over-depletion of the sheep, ensuring long-term survival for both species."
