            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still healthy at 97.17, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain the wolf population while ensuring the sheep do not deplete too quickly. A balanced approach at this stage will support sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 78.1% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balanced approach. This will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, as it allows for sustainable coexistence without depleting the sheep population too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while I want to ensure my pack thrives, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain balance, considering the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need for gradual adjustments.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring both populations can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term survival of both species. This moderate adjustment helps maintain a balance as the wolf population is relatively high, and it allows for gradual adaptation to the ecosystem",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still considering the need for coexistence. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to ensure both populations can thrive without depleting resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.97, which is only 23.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I can afford to hunt, I need to be cautious to allow the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.450 to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for some hunting while still prioritizing the sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.48, which is only 18.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting to sustain the wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking a rapid decline in the sheep population, promoting a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.43, which is only 15.8% of its maximum capacity. While I need to focus on hunting to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.01, which is only 13.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring a balance that supports both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the wolf population is relatively high. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain our numbers while allowing the sheep to recover. This adjustment is gradual, aligning with the wisdom of maintaining balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.29, which is only 11.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from the previous theta of 0.40 to 0.35, I can still maintain some hunting activity while prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both the sheep and wolf populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I need to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.03, which is only 10.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own wolf population. A theta of 0.35 allows for a slight focus on competition among wolves while still permitting some hunting, ensuring that we do not deplete the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.86, which is only 9.9% of its maximum capacity. While I need to focus on hunting to ensure my pack"
