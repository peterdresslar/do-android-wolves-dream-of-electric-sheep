            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 47.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.77, it is prudent to focus more on competing with other wolves to allow the sheep population to recover. This will help ensure long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 39.89, which is only 36.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I can increase my hunting intensity slightly, I should do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still giving sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 30.85, which is only 28.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased slightly, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A small increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery.",
