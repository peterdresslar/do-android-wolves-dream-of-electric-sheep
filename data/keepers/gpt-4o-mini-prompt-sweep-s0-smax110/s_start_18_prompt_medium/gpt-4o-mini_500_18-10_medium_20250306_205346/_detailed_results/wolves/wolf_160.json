            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in sheep numbers, jeopardizing long-term sustainability. Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition with other wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and while I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and a slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain the balance while allowing for some recovery of the sheep. This moderate adjustment will support the wolf population without risking a significant depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still healthy at 94.4% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 38, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 94.75, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment aims to maintain a balance between ensuring our wolf population thrives while allowing the sheep to recover and sustain their numbers. A gradual increase helps avoid over-depletion of the sheep and supports long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we can maintain our hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. A slight reduction from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring that both populations can thrive while avoiding overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term health of both species. This moderate adjustment helps maintain balance as the sheep population is recovering, and it allows for gradual adaptation to the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a balance between the wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term survival for both. It also reflects a cautious approach as the wolf population is relatively high, allowing for some competition while still enabling sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring both can thrive without depleting resources too quickly. A gradual increase is necessary to adapt to the current conditions while avoiding sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low relative to the wolf population, and a moderate approach will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting. This balance helps ensure the long-term survival of both species without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.67, which is only 22.4% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A moderate adjustment helps maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep can recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.12, which is only 18.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring a balance that supports both populations in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A slight increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach that supports both populations without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.13, which is only 13.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to allow the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while prioritizing the long-term balance between both populations."
