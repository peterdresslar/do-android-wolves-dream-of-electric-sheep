            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 49\n- Sheep population: 11.74\n- Wolf population: 37.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.400\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.32 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 10.7% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and while it is important to maintain a healthy wolf population, I want to ensure that the sheep have enough time to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help balance our needs and promote sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and I want to maintain a balanced approach to ensure sustainable coexistence. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also considering the growth of the wolf population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of my ancestors to avoid sudden changes and promote long-term stability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 91.52, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a good balance. However, to ensure the long-term survival of both species, I will slightly reduce my hunting intensity to allow for sheep recovery while still maintaining enough pressure to support wolf reproduction. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of adapting to changing conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 55.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 65, I need to be cautious to avoid over-depleting the sheep. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, enabling both populations to thrive without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sustainable coexistence. A gradual increase helps maintain balance as the sheep population grows.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the wolf population is relatively high. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while also preventing overcompetition among wolves. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.81, which is only 25.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for wolf reproduction with the sustainability of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.39, which is only 20.4% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A gradual adjustment helps maintain balance and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.62, which is only 16.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting to maintain our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking a rapid depletion of the sheep, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.10, which is only 14.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting sustainability while still considering the need to compete with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.07, which is only 12.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.64, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we are in a competitive environment. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a bit more hunting to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. This approach helps maintain a balance as we adapt to the current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.74, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance while still being cautious about the sheep population"
