            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. With a current sheep-to-wolf ratio of 18.33, focusing on competition among wolves rather than aggressive hunting will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and my previous theta was too low for effective hunting. A slight increase to 0.25 allows for some hunting without overwhelming the sheep population, promoting a sustainable balance while still considering the need for wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at its maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. This will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem and ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep. A gradual adjustment is necessary to avoid depleting the sheep population too quickly.",

Maintaining a lower theta will help prevent over-depletion of sheep while we focus on competition among wolves, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
