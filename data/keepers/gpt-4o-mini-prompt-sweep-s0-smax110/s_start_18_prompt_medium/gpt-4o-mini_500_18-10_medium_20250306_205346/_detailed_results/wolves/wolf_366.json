            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 399\n- Sheep population: 12.67\n- Wolf population: 44.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.450\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.29 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 11.5% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating a need to reduce hunting intensity to prevent depletion. However, I still want to maintain a level of hunting that supports wolf reproduction, so a moderate increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while being mindful of the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that we can afford to hunt a bit more without risking depletion. However, since the wolf population is also present and growing, I want to avoid overhunting and maintain a balance that allows both populations to thrive. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help sustain our pack while still allowing the sheep to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 93.8% of maximum capacity, allowing for a sustainable increase in hunting intensity. However, I want to avoid over-depleting the sheep and maintain a balance as the wolf population is also present. A slight reduction from my previous theta will help ensure that both populations can thrive without leading to a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This approach balances the needs of both populations and avoids overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while I want to ensure my pack thrives, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain balance as the wolf population is close to the sheep population, ensuring we don",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 39.89, which is only 36.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for the sheep to recover. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity from 0.450 to 0.40, I can focus more on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting. This approach helps maintain a balance that supports both the wolf and sheep populations in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 30.85, which is only 28.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need to adapt to the changing conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.21, which is only 22.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I should maintain some hunting to support wolf reproduction, I need to be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.24, which is only 17.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is some room for hunting, I need to be cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low at 16.60, which is only 15.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase to 0.40 allows for some hunting while still considering the long-term sustainability of both populations.",

This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery.",

This suggests that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting without over-depleting the sheep, promoting a sustainable balance."
