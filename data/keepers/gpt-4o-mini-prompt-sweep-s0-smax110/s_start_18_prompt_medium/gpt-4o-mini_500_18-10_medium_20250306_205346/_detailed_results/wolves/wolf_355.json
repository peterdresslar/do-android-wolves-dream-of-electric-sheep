This lower theta value will help maintain the sheep population while also addressing the competition among wolves, ensuring our long-term survival.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and while I need to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while still maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still healthy at 93.8% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with a wolf population of 40, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 93.18, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help ensure the wolf population remains stable without over-depleting the sheep, allowing for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while still maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while it is beneficial to hunt more as their numbers increase, I must also consider the growing wolf population. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow for better coexistence and prevent over-depletion of sheep, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",

This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without overly depleting the sheep population, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 39.89, which is only 36.3% of its maximum capacity. While I want to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I also recognize the need for the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity allows for a more sustainable balance, enabling both populations to thrive in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 28.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 68.00, I need to be cautious not to overhunt, as this could lead to a decline in sheep numbers and ultimately harm our long-term survival. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 22.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.37, a slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow for a more balanced approach, promoting both wolf and sheep populations in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.24, which is only 17.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population and maintaining a balance with the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.60, which is only 15.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting sustainability while still considering the need to compete with other wolves."
