            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 46.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. My previous theta was quite low, and while I need to focus on competition with other wolves, I can afford to increase my hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly. This gradual adjustment will help maintain balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 39.68, which is only 36.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is some room for hunting, I need to be cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate increase from my previous theta of 0.25 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still giving sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.00, which is only 28.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is potential for recovery if I reduce hunting intensity slightly. By increasing theta from 0.35 to 0.40, I can still maintain a focus on hunting while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.67, which is only 22.4% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being mindful of the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.12, which is only 18.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight reduction in hunting intensity allows for a more sustainable balance, enabling both sheep and wolves to recover over time.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.25, which is only 15.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is some opportunity for hunting, it is crucial to prioritize the recovery of the sheep population to ensure long-term sustainability. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, which is necessary given the current wolf population of 54. This approach helps maintain balance without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.13, which is only 13.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting.",
