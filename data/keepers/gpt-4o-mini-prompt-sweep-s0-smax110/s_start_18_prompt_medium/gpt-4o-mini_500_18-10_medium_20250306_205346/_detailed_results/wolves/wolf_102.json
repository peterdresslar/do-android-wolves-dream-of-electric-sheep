            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 118\n- Sheep population: 12.29\n- Wolf population: 40.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.300\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.31 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 11.2% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that we should be cautious with our hunting to avoid depleting their numbers too quickly. A moderate theta allows us to maintain a balance between hunting and ensuring the sheep can recover, while also considering the growing wolf population. This approach supports sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that we can afford to maintain a moderate hunting intensity. This allows for continued reproduction among wolves while still giving sheep a chance to recover. A slight decrease from my previous theta ensures that I am not overexploiting the sheep, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 97.17, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the sheep-to-wolf ratio at 2.16, it indicates that while there are enough sheep for hunting, we should avoid overexploitation to ensure long-term sustainability. A slight reduction from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach as the wolf population is also significant at 45.00, which could lead to competition if not managed carefully.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 78.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.62, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing sustainability. This adjustment will help maintain a balance as the sheep population grows, while also considering the current wolf population and avoiding overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help sustain my pack while still considering the long-term health of the sheep population. A gradual increase aligns with the current trends and maintains balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 39.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With the wolf population at 69, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 30.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, I need to be cautious not to overhunt, as this could lead to a decline in sheep numbers and ultimately harm both populations. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that supports both reproduction and recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.97, which is only 23.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that I should focus on a balanced approach to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support the wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 will help in gradually increasing hunting without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.48, which is only 18.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is some opportunity for hunting, it is crucial to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for a slight focus on hunting while still prioritizing the long-term balance of the ecosystem. This approach will help sustain both the wolf and sheep populations over time.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.43, which is only 15.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should be cautious with our hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between hunting and allowing the sheep population to stabilize, while also considering the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.01, which is only 13.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for wolf population sustainability with the recovery of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.46, which is only 12.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. Additionally, the wolf population is relatively high at 45.00, and focusing on competition among wolves will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be increased slightly to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A gradual increase from my previous theta will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep too quickly."
