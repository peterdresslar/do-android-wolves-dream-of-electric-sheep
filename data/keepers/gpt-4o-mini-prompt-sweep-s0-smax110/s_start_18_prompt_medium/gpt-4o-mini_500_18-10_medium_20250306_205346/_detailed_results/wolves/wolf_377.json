            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 93.8% of maximum capacity, allowing for some increased hunting intensity without risking immediate depletion. However, I want to avoid drastic changes, so a slight reduction from my previous theta will help maintain balance as the wolf population grows.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for some increased hunting intensity without risking depletion. However, with the wolf population also being significant, a moderate approach helps maintain balance and ensures sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that can support wolf reproduction while also ensuring the sheep can recover. This balance helps maintain the ecosystem without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 47.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 67, it is wise to avoid overhunting to prevent a crash in the sheep population. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring both species can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 39.89, which is only 36.3% of its maximum capacity. While I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level (28.0% of maximum capacity), and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are not enough sheep to support a higher hunting intensity without risking depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious to avoid overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.21, which is only 22.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is some room for hunting, it is essential to maintain a balance to allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease from my previous theta of 0.45 will help ensure that I do not over-deplete the sheep while still allowing for some hunting to support the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.24, which is only 17.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is some opportunity for hunting, it is crucial to avoid overexploitation. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain its health.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.60, which is only 15.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to allow for wolf reproduction while still giving sheep a chance to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.39, which is only 13.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is potential for recovery if we allow the sheep to increase. However, with a wolf population of 49, we need to maintain a moderate hunting intensity to ensure our own survival and reproduction. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the balance needed for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.67, which is only 11.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing more on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.67, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.14, which is only 10.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.70, which is only 9.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to help sustain my pack without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the long-term health of the sheep population."
