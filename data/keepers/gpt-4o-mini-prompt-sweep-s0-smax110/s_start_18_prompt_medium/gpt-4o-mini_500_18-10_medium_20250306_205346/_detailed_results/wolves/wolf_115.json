            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 88.3% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and maintain their numbers. A gradual adjustment is key to avoiding sudden population crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 85.86, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, promoting long-term coexistence while still allowing for some growth in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but still below maximum capacity. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to thrive. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep too quickly. A small adjustment allows for a balanced approach, ensuring both populations can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 30.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both populations can thrive. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that supports my pack while still considering the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.97, which is only 23.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I can increase hunting intensity slightly, I need to be cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. A small increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.48, which is only 18.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to allow for recovery. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I need to maintain a balance to ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, a slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted to support my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.01, which is only 13.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.46, which is only 12.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is potential for recovery if I reduce hunting intensity slightly. By increasing theta from 0.35 to 0.40, I can still maintain a focus on hunting while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow, ensuring a sustainable balance between both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the wolf population is relatively high. A moderate hunting intensity will allow for some sheep recovery while preventing overcompetition among wolves. This approach supports sustainable coexistence and avoids drastic changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I need to maintain a balance to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we are competing for limited resources. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on reducing competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.86, which is only 9.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while being mindful of the sheep"
