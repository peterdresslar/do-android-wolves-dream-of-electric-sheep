However, with the wolf population at 68, which is relatively high, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves to maintain balance. A theta of 0.30 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the recovery of both sheep and wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 37.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, allowing for gradual recovery while ensuring the wolf pack remains healthy.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.41, which is only 29.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover while also considering the growing wolf population. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance and prevent over-depletion of the sheep, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.44, which is only 23.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of the wolf pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.33, which is only 18.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover while also considering the growing wolf population. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.43, which is only 15.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.97, which is only 13.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain its health. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.51, which is only 12.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some reproduction among wolves while still giving sheep a chance to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without risking a rapid depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.24, which is only 11.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support our needs without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.53, which is only 10.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.93, which is only 9.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly decreasing my hunting intensity from the previous theta of 0.40 to 0.35, I can focus more on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.71, which is only 9.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is an opportunity to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction while still allowing for some recovery of the sheep population. A gradual increase to 0.40 maintains a balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.55, which is only 9.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that the sheep need time to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This gradual adjustment helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.63, which is only 9.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain my pack while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without risking a rapid depletion of sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.73, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support our wolf population without risking a further decline in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.01, which is only 10% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need to adapt to the changing conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.44, which is only 10.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is potential for recovery if I reduce hunting intensity slightly. By increasing theta moderately to 0.45, I can still hunt effectively while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow, ensuring a sustainable balance between both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.89, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A slight decrease from my previous theta will help balance competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, promoting a sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.42, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking their long-term survival. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.00, which is only 11.8% of its maximum capacity. While I want to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep.
