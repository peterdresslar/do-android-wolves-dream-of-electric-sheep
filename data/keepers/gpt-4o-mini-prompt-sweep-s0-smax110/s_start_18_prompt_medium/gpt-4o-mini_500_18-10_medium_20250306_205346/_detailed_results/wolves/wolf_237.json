            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 257\n- Sheep population: 12.89\n- Wolf population: 39.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.350\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.33 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 11.7% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This balance supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover and maintain their numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 95.41, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This balance helps maintain a sustainable ecosystem without risking a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while I want to ensure my pack thrives, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain balance as the wolf population grows, avoiding overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while it is beneficial to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep too quickly. A moderate adjustment allows for a balance between competing with other wolves and maintaining a healthy sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 48.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, the wolf population is relatively high, so a moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep too quickly. This gradual adjustment allows for coexistence while ensuring the health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level relative to its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. A moderate hunting intensity will allow for some hunting while still giving sheep a chance to recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a balance and avoiding sudden changes, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.57, which is only 28.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help sustain our needs without depleting the sheep further, promoting a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.66, which is only 23.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still being cautious about the sheep population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.17, which is only 19.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to allow for some reproduction among wolves while still giving sheep a chance to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.79, which is only 16.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population and maintaining a balance with the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.39, which is only 14.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.89, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we are competing for limited resources. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support our population while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.89, which is only 11.7% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking immediate depletion of the sheep. A gradual increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, enabling us to maintain our wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover."
