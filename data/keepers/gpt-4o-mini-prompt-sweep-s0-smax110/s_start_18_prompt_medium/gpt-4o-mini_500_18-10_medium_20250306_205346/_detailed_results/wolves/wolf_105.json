            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 105\n- Sheep population: 109.81\n- Wolf population: 33.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.439\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 3.33 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 99.8% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while also addressing the growing wolf population. This moderate approach helps maintain balance and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help sustain our wolf population while still allowing sheep to recover and thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 97.17, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a sustainable balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly. It",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 78.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for increased hunting without risking depletion. However, with the wolf population at 53, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must also consider the potential for overhunting. A moderate approach allows for coexistence while keeping an eye on both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight reduction in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a balance as the wolf population is also relatively high. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can ensure the long-term survival of both species while allowing the sheep to recover slightly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 39.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the wolf population is relatively high. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow sheep to recover while still enabling wolves to thrive. This approach supports long-term balance and avoids depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.97, which is only 23.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still being mindful of the need to adapt to the changing populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.48, which is only 18.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting to maintain our wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 will help balance our needs without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.43, which is only 15.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I need to maintain a focus on hunting to support wolf reproduction, I must also be cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the immediate needs of the wolf pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.01, which is only 13.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining some hunting to support our wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.46, which is only 12.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still acknowledging the need for wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the wolf population is relatively high. A moderate hunting intensity allows for some hunting while still giving the sheep a chance to recover.
