            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 395\n- Sheep population: 24.21\n- Wolf population: 65.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.400\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.37 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 22.0% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that we should moderate our hunting to allow the sheep to recover while still ensuring our own survival. A balanced approach will help maintain the delicate ecosystem and prevent over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. With a high sheep-to-wolf ratio and a growing wolf population, it is essential to focus on competition among wolves rather than intense hunting to ensure long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both populations.",

Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery. Maintaining a lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, preventing overexploitation of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at its maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in sheep numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover and ensures the long-term survival of both species. It is crucial to focus on competition with other wolves at this stage to stabilize our population before considering more intense hunting.",

With a high sheep-to-wolf ratio, focusing on competition with other wolves will help stabilize the wolf population while giving sheep a chance to rebound.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A lower theta will help reduce competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to stabilize, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance while still allowing for some hunting to support the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a high level of competition among wolves. Lowering the hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover and maintain their population, which is essential for the long-term survival of both species. This gradual adjustment will help prevent overhunting and ensure a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderate to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring both populations can thrive without depleting resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating a need for a slight increase in hunting intensity to maintain balance. However, given the current wolf population and the potential for overhunting, I will adjust my theta gradually to ensure sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still healthy, and I want to ensure their recovery while also allowing for some hunting to support our wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain balance without over-depleting the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 93.18, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance of the ecosystem. This moderate adjustment will help maintain the wolf population without over-depleting the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help sustain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A moderate increase from my previous theta reflects a balanced approach to ensure long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, but the wolf population is also significant. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling wolves to thrive. This approach maintains a balance and avoids over-depletion of the sheep, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 47.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 67, which is relatively high, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for more hunting while still considering the long-term balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level (36.3% of maximum capacity), and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are fewer sheep available per wolf. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting sheep. This will allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a healthy balance in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 30.85, which is only 28.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.21, which is only 22.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for more hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance that supports both populations. This approach aligns with the wisdom of making gradual adjustments in response to the current state of the ecosystem."
