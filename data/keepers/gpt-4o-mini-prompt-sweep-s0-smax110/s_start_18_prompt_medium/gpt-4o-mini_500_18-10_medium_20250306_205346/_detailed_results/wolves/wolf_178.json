            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 94.75, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term health of both populations. This moderate adjustment helps prevent over-depletion of sheep while allowing wolves to maintain their numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 74.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 54, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to prevent a crash in the sheep population. A moderate increase to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach that supports both wolf reproduction and sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual increase in theta aligns with the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need to avoid sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, and while it is beneficial to increase hunting intensity as the sheep population grows, the wolf population is also significant. A slight reduction in hunting intensity allows for a more sustainable balance, giving sheep a chance to recover while still ensuring the wolf population remains healthy.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 36.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure long-term survival. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting both wolf reproduction and sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low relative to the wolf population, and a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species and avoids depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.67, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking over-depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.12, which is only 18.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking a rapid decline in the sheep population, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.25, which is only 15.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is potential for recovery if I reduce hunting intensity slightly. By increasing theta to 0.40, I can maintain a balance between hunting and allowing the sheep population to stabilize, while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. This gradual adjustment supports sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.64, which is only 12.4% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A gradual increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.61, which is only 11.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a presence in the hunting cycle. A theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without overwhelming the sheep population, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively low at 11.89, which is only 10.8% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, a slight increase in hunting intensity will help me capitalize on the current sheep numbers without depleting them too quickly. This moderate adjustment allows for sustainable coexistence while still considering the need for gradual changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.46, which is only 10.4% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity slightly to allow the sheep to recover while still competing with other wolves. This moderate approach will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem."
