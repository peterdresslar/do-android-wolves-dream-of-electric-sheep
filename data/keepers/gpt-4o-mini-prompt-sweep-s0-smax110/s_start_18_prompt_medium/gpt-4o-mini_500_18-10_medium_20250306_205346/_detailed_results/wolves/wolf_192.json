            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for some increased hunting intensity without risking depletion. However, I want to ensure that the wolf population remains stable, so I will make a moderate adjustment rather than a drastic one. This will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for some hunting without risking depletion. This value supports sustainable coexistence while still enabling the wolf population to thrive. It reflects a balanced approach, considering the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need to adapt to changing conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and while it is important to maintain a healthy wolf population, I need to ensure that the sheep can recover. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while also giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.00, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that competition among wolves is significant. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain its health. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments to ensure long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.67, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can recover over time.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.12, which is only 18.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is an opportunity to hunt, I should focus on a more balanced approach to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 will help maintain the wolf population while ensuring the sheep can rebound, preventing overhunting and promoting sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.25, which is only 15.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for sustainable hunting without risking depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still being mindful of the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.13, which is only 13.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate increase to 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a more sustainable approach, balancing the needs of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.61, which is only 11.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for wolf survival while giving sheep a chance to increase their numbers. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.89, which is only 10.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain a balance and prevent overhunting, which could lead to a crash in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.46, which is only 10.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity to 0.35, I can still focus on competition with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.24, which is only 10.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some recovery of the sheep while still ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without risking a crash in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.12, which is only 10.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.43, which is only 10.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack without depleting the sheep further, promoting a healthier balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.73, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking their long-term survival.
