            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 47\n- Sheep population: 14.07\n- Wolf population: 47.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.400\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.30 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 12.8% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. A moderate theta value will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can stabilize, which is crucial for long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to depletion of their numbers. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a sustainable wolf population. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of my ancestors, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly. A moderate approach ensures we can coexist sustainably.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 91.52, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we can afford to be cautious. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling us to compete effectively with other wolves. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment reflects a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the long-term sustainability of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 55.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population slightly higher than the sheep population, it is wise to maintain a balanced approach to avoid over-depleting the sheep while ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for competition among wolves while still permitting some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. It reflects a balanced approach, responding to the current conditions without drastic changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 32.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.51, it is wise to focus slightly more on competition with other wolves to allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a sustainable balance. This gradual adjustment will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.81, which is only 25.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A slight decrease from my previous theta will help balance our needs and ensure sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.39, which is only 20.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.62, which is only 16.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking the depletion of the sheep population, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.10, which is only 14.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. By increasing theta slightly from 0.35 to 0.40, I can enhance hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.07, which is only 12.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.4 to 0.35, I can maintain a focus on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring the long-term survival of both species."
