            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that they can sustain some hunting pressure without immediate risk of depletion. However, with the wolf population at 18, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure our long-term survival. A moderate increase in hunting intensity allows for reproduction while still considering the health of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at its maximum capacity, and while we need to maintain our hunting to support our wolf population, we must also be cautious to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A moderate theta allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. With a high sheep-to-wolf ratio and a growing wolf population, it is crucial to focus on competition among wolves rather than depleting the sheep further. This approach will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery. Maintaining a lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in sheep numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and while I want to increase hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while ensuring that we do not deplete their numbers too quickly. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to balance our needs with the sustainability of the ecosystem, as the sheep population is close to its maximum capacity.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 94.75, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 74.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep. However, the wolf population is also significant at 54, which suggests that I should focus on maintaining balance rather than intensifying hunting. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still supporting the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to ensure that both populations can thrive without depleting resources too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low relative to the wolf population, and while I want to ensure the wolves can thrive, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, preventing over-depletion of the sheep while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.67, which is only 22.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for moderate hunting without risking depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for sustainable hunting while still considering the need to balance competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.12, which is only 18.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is some opportunity for hunting, it is crucial to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting while prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep, ensuring sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.25, which is only 15.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly."
