            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 51.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating a moderate level of abundance. Given that my previous theta was quite low at 0.096, I can afford to increase my hunting intensity slightly while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This adjustment allows for a gradual balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 43.60, which is only 39.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is room for some hunting, I need to be cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate increase from my previous theta of 0.25 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still giving sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 30.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for gradual hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.49, a slight increase in hunting intensity will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing for the sheep to recover. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.97, which is only 23.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while we can increase our hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction, we must be cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. A moderate increase to 0.45 allows for some hunting while still considering the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.48, which is only 18.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while gradually allowing the sheep population to stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.43, which is only 15.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase to 0.40 allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery.",

By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This gradual adjustment helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the wolf population is relatively high. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help sustain our numbers while allowing the sheep to recover gradually. This adjustment is small enough to avoid drastic impacts on the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.29, which is only 11.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a presence in hunting to support our wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting without over-depleting the sheep, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.62, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",

To allow the sheep to recover and ensure sustainable coexistence, I will focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intense hunting. This moderate adjustment will help balance the ecosystem while still allowing for some hunting.",
