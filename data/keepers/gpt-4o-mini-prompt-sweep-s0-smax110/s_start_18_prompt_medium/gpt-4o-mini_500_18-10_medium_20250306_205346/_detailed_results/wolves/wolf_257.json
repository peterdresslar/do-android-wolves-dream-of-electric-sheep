However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.52, it is essential to focus on competition among wolves to prevent overhunting and allow the sheep population to recover. A moderate theta of 0.3 allows for a balanced approach that supports both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A moderate increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, considering both the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need for gradual adaptation.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and while it is important to maintain a healthy wolf population, I need to be cautious about overhunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population.",

This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need to adapt to the changing conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.17, which is only 19.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population, ensuring a sustainable balance.",

This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.39, which is only 14.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach that prioritizes competition with other wolves while still permitting some hunting, ensuring long-term sustainability.",

A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 allows for more hunting to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious about the sheep population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.02, which is only 10.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach that balances our need for sustenance with the long-term health of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.50, which is only 10.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some reproduction among wolves while still enabling the sheep population to recover.

This indicates a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.400 to 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.24, which is only 10.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support our wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for sustainable hunting while still considering the need for balance as the wolf population is also significant at 18.00."
