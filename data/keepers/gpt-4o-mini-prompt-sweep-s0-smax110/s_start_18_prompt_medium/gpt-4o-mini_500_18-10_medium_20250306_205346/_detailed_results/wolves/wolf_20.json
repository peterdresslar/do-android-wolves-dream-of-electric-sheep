            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that we can afford to reduce hunting intensity slightly to allow for some recovery. This adjustment helps maintain a balance between our population and the sheep, ensuring sustainable coexistence while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A moderate approach will help maintain a balance between our population and the sheep, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution in hunting to prevent over-depletion. A lower theta allows for competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem while ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that we should be cautious with our hunting to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a high availability of prey. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover while also managing the wolf population. This moderate approach will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be cautiously increased to prevent over-depletion. However, since the wolf population is also significant, I need to maintain a balance to avoid competition among wolves. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for sustainable hunting while keeping the ecosystem in check.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while maintaining a sustainable balance with the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 91.52, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to maintain balance, considering the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 77.75, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while maintaining a sustainable balance with the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, but the wolf population is also significant. A moderate hunting intensity allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves. This approach helps prevent over-depletion of the sheep and maintains a balance between the two populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery. A gradual increase helps maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the wolf population is relatively high. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain their numbers. This gradual adjustment helps ensure long-term balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.81, which is only 25.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for increased hunting intensity without depleting the sheep too quickly. However, with the wolf population at 68, I must also be cautious not to overhunt, as it could lead to future competition among wolves. A slight increase to 0.45 allows for sustainable hunting while still considering the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.39, which is only 20.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is an opportunity to hunt, it is crucial to avoid overexploitation. By adopting a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to recover while maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.62, which is only 16.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase to 0.40 allows for more hunting while still considering the need for sheep recovery and the overall balance of the ecosystem."
