            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for moderate hunting without risking depletion. This value balances the need for wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover and thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 41.65, which is only 37.9% of its maximum capacity. While my previous theta of 0.600 allowed for some hunting, it is important to shift towards a more balanced approach to ensure the sheep can recover. A theta of 0.45 allows for moderate hunting while also considering the need to compete with other wolves, promoting a sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.41, which is only 29.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.44, which is only 23.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.33, which is only 18.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain its health. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 reflects a balanced strategy that prioritizes coexistence and gradual adaptation to the current ecosystem state.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.43, which is only 15.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain my pack while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help balance the needs of both wolves and sheep without risking a rapid depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.97, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a significant competition for resources. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while still enabling the wolf population to sustain itself. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and maintaining a balance.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.24, which is only 11.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for wolf population sustainability while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.53, which is only 10.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some recovery of the sheep population while still ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.93, which is only 9.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while maintaining a sustainable wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 will help balance our competition with other wolves and ensure that we do not overhunt the sheep, allowing for a gradual recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.71, which is only 9.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is an opportunity to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A gradual increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, ensuring that we do not deplete the sheep too quickly while also considering the growth of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.55, which is only 9.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.01, which is only 10% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure and promote a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.44, which is only 10.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I can increase my hunting intensity slightly, I must be cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate increase to 0.35 allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population.",
