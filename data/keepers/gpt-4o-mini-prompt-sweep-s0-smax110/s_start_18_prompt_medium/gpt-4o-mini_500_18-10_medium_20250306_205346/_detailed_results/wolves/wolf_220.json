            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to prevent depletion. A theta of 0.5 allows for a balanced approach, ensuring that both sheep and wolves can thrive without risking a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. With a high sheep-to-wolf ratio, focusing on competition with other wolves will help stabilize the wolf population while preventing overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover and ensures the long-term survival of both species. It is crucial to focus on competition with other wolves at this stage to stabilize our population before considering any increase in hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in sheep numbers, jeopardizing the long-term survival of both species. Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition with other wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that they are vulnerable to overhunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting while still prioritizing the long-term health of both the sheep and wolf populations. This moderate adjustment helps maintain balance without risking a crash in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and a slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep too quickly. This adjustment allows for sustainable coexistence while also supporting the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment helps maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring both can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 95.41, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep do not become over-depleted. A gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while it is beneficial to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must also consider the potential for overhunting. A moderate approach allows for coexistence while keeping an eye on both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but it is still below maximum capacity. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to thrive. This approach maintains a balance that supports both species in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a sustainable balance. This adjustment will help support the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity slightly to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining enough hunting to support the wolf population. This moderate adjustment will help create a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.57, which is only 28.7% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 strikes a balance between competing with other wolves and allowing the sheep population to stabilize, avoiding overhunting and potential crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.66, which is only 23.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach to hunting while still considering the need to compete with other wolves. This gradual adjustment helps maintain a healthy ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.17, which is only 19.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is potential for recovery if we reduce hunting intensity. By slightly lowering theta, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.79, which is only 16.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting without risking the depletion of sheep. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still being mindful of the sheep"
