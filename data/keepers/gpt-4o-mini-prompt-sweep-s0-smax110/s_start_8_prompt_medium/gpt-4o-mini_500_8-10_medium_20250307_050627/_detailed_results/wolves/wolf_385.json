            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 94.10, allowing for some increased hunting intensity without risking depletion. However, I need to be cautious as the wolf population is also growing, so a moderate increase in theta will help maintain balance while ensuring the sustainability of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly, and I want to strike a balance that supports both species in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly, ensuring long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69.00, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and while it is important to maintain a healthy wolf population, I need to ensure that the sheep can recover. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while also giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, promoting long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.06, which is only 25.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is some room for hunting, I need to be cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight reduction from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still enabling some hunting to support our population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.96, which is only 20% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a moderate increase in hunting intensity is appropriate to help support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A gradual adjustment to 0.45 reflects a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without risking a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.98, which is only 16.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is some room for hunting, it is crucial to avoid overexploitation to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.45, which is only 14.0% of its maximum capacity. While I need to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must do so gradually to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach that considers both the current low sheep population and the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.45, which is only 12.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without jeopardizing the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.02, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low at 0.28. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep population to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while ensuring that the sheep have a chance to increase in number, which is essential for long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.22, which is only 10.2% of its maximum capacity. While I need to focus on hunting to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.64, which is only 9.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.33, which is only 9.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to allow for some recovery of the sheep while still maintaining a focus on competition with other wolves. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach, promoting sustainability without risking a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.16, which is only 9.2% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable balance, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting. This will help prevent further depletion of the sheep population while maintaining a healthy wolf community."
