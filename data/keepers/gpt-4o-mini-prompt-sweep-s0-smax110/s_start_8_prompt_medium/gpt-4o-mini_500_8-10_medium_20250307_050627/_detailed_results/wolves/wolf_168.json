            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and my previous theta was quite low. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover. A gradual increase in theta will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. A moderate hunting intensity will allow for some sheep recovery while still enabling wolves to maintain their numbers. This approach supports long-term coexistence and avoids depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and a moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance between the wolf and sheep populations. This adjustment allows for sustainable coexistence while still considering the current trends in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 90.3% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing sheep to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 87.89, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to maintain balance, considering the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need to avoid overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because it represents a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balanced approach. The sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and a small adjustment allows for continued reproduction of wolves without depleting the sheep too quickly. This strategy supports long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, and while it is beneficial to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must also consider the growing wolf population. A theta of 0.40 allows for a balanced approach that promotes coexistence while still enabling some hunting to ensure our pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover gradually.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 30.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 70, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.28, which is only 23.9% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A moderate adjustment helps maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep can recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.74, which is only 18.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to allow for recovery. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.35, which is only 15.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to overhunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.93, which is only 13.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for the sheep to recover. By setting a theta of 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This gradual adjustment helps maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.36, which is only 12.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain our wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing our immediate needs."
