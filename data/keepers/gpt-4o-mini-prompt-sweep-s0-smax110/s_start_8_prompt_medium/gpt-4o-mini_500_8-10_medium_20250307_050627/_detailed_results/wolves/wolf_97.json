            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution in hunting to prevent depletion. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, enabling us to sustain both the wolf and sheep populations while gradually adapting to the current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A moderate theta value will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can stabilize, preventing future crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. With a high sheep-to-wolf ratio, focusing on competition with other wolves will help stabilize our population while giving sheep a chance to rebound.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be cautiously increased to avoid depleting their numbers too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and a slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep too quickly. This moderate adjustment allows for sustainable coexistence while also supporting the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 93.2% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 84% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity. This will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations while avoiding over-depletion of the sheep. Additionally, with the wolf population at 49, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the wolf population is also relatively high. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain their numbers. This approach supports long-term coexistence and avoids depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual increase aligns with the current trends and avoids sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 34.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 69, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 29.01, which is only 26.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that promotes coexistence while still considering the need to compete with other wolves as their numbers grow.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.17, which is only 21.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still giving sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.77, which is only 17.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is some opportunity for hunting, it is crucial to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for wolf reproduction with the sustainability of the sheep population. This adjustment will help prevent overhunting while still allowing for some hunting to support our pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.32, which is only 14.8% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, a slight increase in hunting intensity will help balance the needs of both species. This adjustment allows for sustainable coexistence while still being cautious not to over-deplete the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.17, which is only 12.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to allow for recovery. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the sustainability of both populations."
