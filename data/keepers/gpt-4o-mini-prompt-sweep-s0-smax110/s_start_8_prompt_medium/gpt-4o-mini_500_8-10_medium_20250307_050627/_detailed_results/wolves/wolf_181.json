            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 221\n- Sheep population: 10.83\n- Wolf population: 32.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.400\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.34 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 9.8% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This slight decrease from my previous theta reflects a cautious approach to maintain balance as the wolf population grows.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 87.89, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we have enough prey to sustain our pack without overhunting. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover further while still supporting our wolf population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. It reflects a cautious approach to ensure both populations can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 51.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.85, it is wise to focus on maintaining a balance that allows both populations to thrive. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help the sheep recover while still allowing for some hunting to support the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 39.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 70, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting, which could lead to a crash in the sheep population. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still promoting coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 30.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 70, it's important to avoid overhunting to prevent a crash in the sheep population. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow for a more sustainable balance while still enabling some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.28, which is only 23.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for increased hunting intensity without depleting the sheep too quickly. However, since the wolf population is relatively high at 67.00, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for sustainable hunting while still considering the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.74, which is only 18.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is an opportunity for hunting, it is crucial to avoid overexploitation to allow the sheep population to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I need to focus on hunting to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.93, which is only 13.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is potential for recovery if I reduce my hunting intensity slightly. By setting theta to 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.36, which is only 12.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting without risking the depletion of the sheep. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still being mindful of the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we are competing for limited resources. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling us to maintain our population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of balancing our needs with the health of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.40, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking immediate depletion. This adjustment supports my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.83, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach, ensuring the long-term survival of both species."
