            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help support the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover and maintain balance in the ecosystem. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we are in a competitive environment. By lowering my hunting intensity slightly, I can allow the sheep population to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of balancing our needs with the ecosystem",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.21, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking over-depletion. This adjustment will help support the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual increase is necessary to maintain balance and avoid sudden crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.75, which is only 16.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.41, which is only 14.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I need to maintain some hunting to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach that encourages sheep recovery while still supporting the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.32, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance while still considering the need for wolf population sustainability.",
