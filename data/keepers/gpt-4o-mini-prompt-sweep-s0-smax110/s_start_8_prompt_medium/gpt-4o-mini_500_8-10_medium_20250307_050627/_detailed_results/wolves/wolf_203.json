A moderate increase to 0.45 allows for a balanced approach that supports both wolf reproduction and sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.74, which is only 18.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is some opportunity for hunting, it is crucial to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting while prioritizing the long-term balance between both populations, ensuring that we do not deplete the sheep further and can sustain our wolf pack.",

This indicates that there is potential for recovery if I reduce hunting intensity slightly.

This indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own wolf population.
