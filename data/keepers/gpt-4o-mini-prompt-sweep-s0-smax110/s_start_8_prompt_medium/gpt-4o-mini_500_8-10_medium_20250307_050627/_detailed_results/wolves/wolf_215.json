            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery. Maintaining a lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, preventing overhunting and allowing for a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at its maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in sheep numbers, jeopardizing the long-term survival of both species. Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover while we focus on competition among wolves, ensuring a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery. Maintaining a lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, preventing overhunting and allowing for a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be cautiously increased to prevent depletion. However, given the current wolf population and the need for sustainable coexistence, a small increase from my previous theta allows for a gradual adjustment while still focusing on competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. With a high sheep-to-wolf ratio, focusing on competition with other wolves will help maintain balance and prevent overhunting, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that I can afford to increase my hunting intensity slightly without risking a rapid depletion of the sheep. This moderate adjustment allows for a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring both populations can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring both can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 96.23, allowing for a moderate hunting approach that supports sustainability. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio of 2.14, I want to ensure that we do not overhunt and risk depleting the sheep population, while still allowing for some hunting to support our wolf population. This slight decrease from my previous theta reflects a cautious approach to maintain balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 84.31, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction. However, I must remain cautious and avoid overhunting, as the sheep population is not at maximum capacity. This moderate adjustment helps maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep can recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach, ensuring that as the sheep population is above 60%, I can hunt a bit more without risking depletion. Additionally, with the wolf population being relatively stable, a moderate theta allows for healthy competition among wolves while still enabling sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term sustainability while also considering the current trends.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.65, it is important to maintain a balanced approach to ensure the long-term survival of both species. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population also being relatively high, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A gradual increase to 0.45 allows for better reproduction while still considering the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.00, which is only 24.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing our own population. A moderate theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species."
