            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 59.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.01, it is important to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population. A lower theta value will help reduce competition among wolves and promote a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 70, it is wise to avoid overhunting to allow for recovery and coexistence. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help balance the needs of both populations without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 33.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, the wolf population is relatively high, and to avoid over-depleting the sheep, I will increase my hunting intensity only slightly. This gradual adjustment allows for a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.62, which is only 26.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for more hunting intensity while still being cautious, as the wolf population is relatively high at 70.00. This adjustment aims to maintain a balance that supports both populations in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.21, which is only 20.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I can increase hunting intensity, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.450 to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, focusing on sustainable coexistence while still considering the needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.75, which is only 16.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should prioritize allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for sustenance with the goal of long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.41, which is only 14.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach to hunting while still being cautious of the wolf population growth.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.32, which is only 12.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for sustenance with the long-term health of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.18, which is only 11.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is a need for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction, we must be careful not to deplete the sheep further.
