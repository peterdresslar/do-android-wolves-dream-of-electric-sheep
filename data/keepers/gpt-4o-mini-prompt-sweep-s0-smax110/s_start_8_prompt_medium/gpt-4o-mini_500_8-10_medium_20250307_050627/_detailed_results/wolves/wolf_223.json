With a high sheep-to-wolf ratio, focusing on competition with other wolves will help maintain our population while giving the sheep a chance to rebound.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both species without depleting the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery and prevent depletion. Maintaining a lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, while also allowing for a gradual adjustment as conditions change.",

A slight increase from my previous theta reflects a cautious approach to balance hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that supports both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is close to its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring long-term sustainability.",

However, with the wolf population being relatively high, a slight reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and allow both populations to thrive without depleting the sheep too quickly.",

A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help the sheep recover while still allowing for some hunting to support the wolf population.",

This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing sheep to recover. A gradual increase aligns with the wisdom of adapting to changing conditions.",
