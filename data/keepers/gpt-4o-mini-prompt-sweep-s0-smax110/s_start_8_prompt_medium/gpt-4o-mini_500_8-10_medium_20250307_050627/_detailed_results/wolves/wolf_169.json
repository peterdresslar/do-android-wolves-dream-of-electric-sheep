            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 218\n- Sheep population: 13.36\n- Wolf population: 46.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.350\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.29 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 12.1% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution in hunting to allow for recovery. With a high sheep-to-wolf ratio and a previous theta that was very low, a slight increase to 0.15 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term balance and survival of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and my previous low hunting intensity has allowed for some recovery. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I will gradually increase my hunting intensity while still prioritizing competition with other wolves to maintain a healthy balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and while I want to ensure the wolves can thrive, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain our wolf population while still ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual increase in theta allows us to adapt to the current conditions without risking a sudden depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 87.89, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 52.00, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 66.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. A moderate increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that supports wolf reproduction while still considering the long-term health of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 51.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 67.00, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level relative to its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance while still considering the need for wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 33.51, which is only 30.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I can increase my hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate increase to 0.45 allows for a balanced approach that considers both the current sheep population and the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.28, which is only 23.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is an opportunity to hunt, I need to be cautious and avoid overexploitation. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.45 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population and maintaining a balance with the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.74, which is only 18.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I need to maintain some hunting to support wolf reproduction, I should also be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still being mindful of the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.35, which is only 15.8% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, allowing both populations to stabilize without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.93, which is only 13.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from the previous theta of 0.40 to 0.35, I can still maintain some hunting activity while prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of avoiding sudden changes and responding to the current state of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.36, which is only 12.1% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I also want to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the sustainability of both populations."
