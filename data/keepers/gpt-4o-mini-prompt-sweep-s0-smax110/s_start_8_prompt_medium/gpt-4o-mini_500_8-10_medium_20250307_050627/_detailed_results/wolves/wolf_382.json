            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 430\n- Sheep population: 10.64\n- Wolf population: 33.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.400\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.32 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 9.7% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 85.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep. However, my previous theta was quite low, and the wolf population is also significant. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I will gradually increase my hunting intensity to allow for some sheep depletion while still focusing on competition with other wolves. This moderate increase will help maintain balance without risking a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term survival for both.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and a slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain our wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. This adjustment allows for a gradual response to the current conditions while keeping in mind the long-term balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both populations can thrive. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for more hunting while still prioritizing balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 36.68, which is only 33.3% of its maximum capacity. While I need to maintain a healthy wolf population, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.06, which is only 25.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for more hunting to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious about the sheep population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.96, which is only 20% of its maximum capacity. While I want to ensure the survival of my pack, I also recognize the need to allow the sheep to recover. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, allowing both populations to stabilize without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.98, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta will help balance the need for hunting with the necessity of maintaining the sheep population for future sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.45, which is only 14.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach to hunting while still considering the need to compete with other wolves. This gradual adjustment helps maintain a healthy ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.45, which is only 12.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to be cautious with our hunting to allow the sheep to recover. However, with a moderate wolf population of 48, a slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted to ensure our pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.02, which is only 10.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for sheep recovery while still competing with other wolves. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for sustainable coexistence with the current pressures on both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I need to focus on hunting to sustain my pack, I must also be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for more hunting without risking a crash in the sheep population, promoting a healthier balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.64, which is only 9.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for wolf reproduction with the sustainability of the sheep population.",

This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still being mindful of the need to compete with other wolves."
