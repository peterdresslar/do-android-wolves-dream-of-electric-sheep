            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery. Maintaining a theta of 0.30 helps ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers, jeopardizing the long-term balance of the ecosystem. Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover while keeping competition among wolves in check.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery. Maintaining a lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, preventing overhunting and promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution in hunting to prevent depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, enabling some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves to maintain a sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help sustain both populations without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 93.2% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 84% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help ensure the wolf population remains healthy without depleting the sheep too quickly. A gradual approach is essential to avoid sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 77.74, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still maintaining a sustainable balance with the sheep population. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.34, a moderate increase to 0.45 allows for continued coexistence without risking depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 56.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population being slightly higher than the sheep population, I need to focus on competition among wolves to prevent overhunting and allow the sheep to recover. A gradual decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain balance without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, which is relatively high, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that supports both sheep recovery and wolf population stability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and while it is important to maintain a healthy wolf population, I need to allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help ensure that both populations can stabilize and thrive in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 29.01, which is only 26.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach that considers both the immediate need for food and the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.17, which is only 21.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is some opportunity for hunting, it is essential to maintain a balance to allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease from my previous theta of 0.450 will help reduce pressure on the sheep while still allowing for some hunting to support the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.77, which is only 17.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should be cautious with our hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 reflects a balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to support our population without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.32, which is only 14.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of the wolf pack."
