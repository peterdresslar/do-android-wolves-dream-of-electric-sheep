A slight reduction in hunting intensity allows for continued reproduction among wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover, maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at its maximum capacity, and hunting them more aggressively could lead to depletion. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. With a high sheep-to-wolf ratio, focusing on competition with other wolves will help maintain our population without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to depletion of their numbers, jeopardizing the long-term survival of both species. Maintaining a lower theta allows for recovery of sheep while keeping competition among wolves in check.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery. With the wolf population at 8, maintaining a lower theta helps prevent overexploitation of the sheep and supports a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
