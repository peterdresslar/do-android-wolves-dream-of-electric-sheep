            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 222\n- Sheep population: 10.60\n- Wolf population: 28.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.350\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.38 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 9.6% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3. Adjust your hunting intensity gradually in response to population changes\n4. Find a balance that creates sustainable cycles rather than crashes\n5.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 79.9% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance as the sheep population can support a slightly higher predation rate without risking depletion. Additionally, with the wolf population at 52, a gradual increase in hunting intensity will help ensure our pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 66.4% of its maximum capacity, which allows for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This value reflects a balanced approach, enabling us to sustain our wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover and thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 51.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. However, the wolf population is relatively high, so I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves while allowing the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the wolf population is relatively high. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still ensuring that the wolf population remains healthy. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.28, which is only 23.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for moderate hunting to help sustain the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 will help balance the need for hunting with the necessity of maintaining a healthy sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.74, which is only 18.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to allow for recovery. A moderate theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.35, which is only 15.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.93, which is only 13.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.36, which is only 12.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable, and while I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.350 to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, focusing on sustainable coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.11, which is only 11.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable, and I should focus on allowing them to recover while also considering the growing wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.40, which is only 10.4% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A gradual increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, considering the need for both wolves and sheep to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.83, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain my pack's health.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.60, which is only 9.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for wolves to thrive."
