            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while giving sheep a chance to rebound. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep to recover while ensuring that our pack does not overhunt and deplete resources. This gradual approach will help maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery. Maintaining a lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, preventing overhunting and allowing for a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery. Maintaining a lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, preventing overhunting and allowing for a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution in hunting to prevent depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of sheep. This balanced approach helps maintain the delicate ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that they can sustain a bit more hunting without risking depletion. However, with the wolf population also present, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that supports both wolf reproduction and sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover and thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 96.23, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to ensure sustainable coexistence, as the sheep are at 87.5% of their maximum capacity. By keeping theta moderate, I can support the wolf population without risking a rapid depletion of sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 84.31, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while ensuring we do not over-deplete their numbers. This adjustment reflects a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction without risking a crash in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must also consider the potential for over-depletion of the sheep. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a more cautious approach, ensuring that both populations can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports my pack",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A slight decrease from my previous theta will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can stabilize and grow.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.77, which is only 19.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting without risking depletion. However, with a wolf population of 61, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.16, which is only 16.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our needs without depleting the sheep further, promoting a more balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.83, which is only 14.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is an opportunity to increase hunting intensity, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, enabling sustainable coexistence while still addressing the needs of the wolf population."
