            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. With a high sheep-to-wolf ratio, focusing on competition with other wolves will help stabilize our population while giving sheep a chance to rebound.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. A gradual increase from my previous theta will help balance competition with other wolves while still considering the need for sustainable sheep population levels.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. A moderate approach will help maintain a balance between the wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term survival for both.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery. Maintaining a lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, preventing overhunting and allowing for a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in sheep numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition with other wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at its maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderate to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance, ensuring the wolf population remains healthy while preventing overhunting of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and a slight increase in hunting intensity will help manage the sheep population while still allowing for some recovery. This adjustment balances the needs of both wolves and sheep, promoting sustainability without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 94.5% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a sustainable balance. This adjustment will help support the wolf population without risking a rapid depletion of sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 93.96, allowing for a moderate hunting approach. This will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations while avoiding overhunting, which could lead to a crash in sheep numbers. A slight decrease from my previous theta reflects the need to adapt to the growing wolf population and ensure sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep. This moderate adjustment will help maintain our population without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while I want to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I also recognize the need to allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and prevent over-depletion of the sheep, while still allowing for some hunting to support wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.99, which is only 26.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, a more moderate approach is necessary to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.96, which is only 20.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is potential for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.55, which is only 16.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting approach. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support our wolf population without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance."
