            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 84% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while avoiding over-depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate approach to hunting. This will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep. Gradually reducing hunting intensity will also support the wolf population as it grows.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to ensure that both populations can thrive without depleting resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, the wolf population is relatively high, and I need to focus on competition with other wolves to prevent overhunting. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population and maintaining a balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still being mindful of the sheep population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 29.01, which is 26.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased slightly to support wolf reproduction, it is essential to avoid overhunting to allow the sheep population to recover. A moderate increase to 0.45 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for sustenance with the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.17, which is only 21.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A slight decrease from my previous theta of 0.45 will help balance our needs with the sustainability of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.77, which is only 17.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for wolf survival while ensuring the sheep population can stabilize and grow.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.32, which is only 14.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for more hunting intensity while still being cautious, as the wolf population is relatively high at 53. I aim to maintain a balance that supports both populations over the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.17, which is only 12.9% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. This will help balance the ecosystem and prevent over-depletion of the sheep population.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.78, which is only 10.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.400 to 0.350, I can maintain a focus on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.26, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking over-depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.98, which is only 10.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover rather than intensifying hunting. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for some hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.84, which is only 9.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be slightly increased to support wolf reproduction, it is crucial to avoid overhunting to allow the sheep population to recover. A small increase to 0.40 reflects a cautious approach to balance hunting and competition with other wolves.",
