            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 304\n- Sheep population: 17.94\n- Wolf population: 6.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.350\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 2.99 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 16.3% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while maintaining a sustainable balance with the sheep population, which is still recovering. A gradual increase helps avoid sudden shifts that could destabilize the ecosystem.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.77, which is only 19.8% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to take advantage of the available prey while still being cautious. A moderate increase to 0.40 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring both populations can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.16, which is only 16.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to ensure our own survival. A theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting while prioritizing the long-term balance between our populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.83, which is only 14.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for wolves to thrive.",
