            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 72\n- Sheep population: 22.96\n- Wolf population: 65.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.400\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.35 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 20.9% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition with other wolves. A gradual approach will help maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to depletion of their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition with other wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and while I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta will enable me to maintain some hunting while still being cautious about over-depleting the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. With a high sheep-to-wolf ratio, focusing on competition among wolves will help maintain our population while giving sheep a chance to rebound.",

This approach also helps to stabilize the wolf population as we face competition from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at maximum capacity, and maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover and prevents overexploitation. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio, it is crucial to focus on competition among wolves rather than aggressive hunting to ensure long-term sustainability.",

To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition with other wolves. A gradual decrease in theta will help maintain balance without causing drastic changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at its maximum capacity, and hunting them aggressively could lead to depletion. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, enabling the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at its maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover and ensures the long-term survival of both species. It also helps to stabilize the wolf population as we focus on competition with other wolves rather than overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover while keeping our wolf population stable. This balance is crucial for long-term survival.",

Given the high sheep-to-wolf ratio, it is crucial to focus on competition among wolves rather than aggressive hunting to ensure long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that they are vulnerable to overhunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach balances the need for wolf reproduction with the sustainability of the ecosystem.",

To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover and prevent overexploitation. A lower theta will help maintain balance and avoid potential crashes in the ecosystem.",

Maintaining a lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, allowing us to adapt to future changes without risking a crash in either population.",

A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance while still allowing for some hunting to support our wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that we can afford to increase our hunting intensity slightly without risking a crash in the sheep population. However, since the wolf population is relatively stable, I want to avoid overhunting and maintain a balance that allows both species to thrive. A gradual increase to 0.40 reflects a cautious approach to ensure sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 104, which allows for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 39, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure sustainability. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 will help maintain a balance while allowing for some growth in the wolf population.",

A slight reduction in hunting intensity allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves. This approach helps prevent over-depletion of the sheep and maintains a balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction. However, I must remain cautious and avoid overhunting, as the wolf population is also significant. A gradual increase helps maintain balance without risking a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 45.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 68, which is relatively high, I need to be cautious about over-hunting. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level relative to its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. A lower theta allows for more competition among wolves, which can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",

This suggests that while I can increase my hunting intensity slightly, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A moderate increase to 0.40 allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.96, which is only 20.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for gradual hunting to help sustain our population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 allows for more hunting without overwhelming the sheep, promoting a balanced ecosystem."
