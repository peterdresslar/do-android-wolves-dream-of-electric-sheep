            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at its maximum capacity, and while it is tempting to increase hunting intensity, a lower theta will allow the sheep to recover and maintain a sustainable balance. This approach also helps to reduce competition among wolves, ensuring our population remains stable.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution in hunting to prevent depletion. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while allowing the sheep population to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 4.07, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and a slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain the balance without depleting the sheep too quickly. This adjustment allows for a gradual response to the current conditions while still prioritizing the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still healthy at 104, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 39, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports our wolf population growth while maintaining a sustainable balance with the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can still recover. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly, and this theta reflects a balanced approach to coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a slight imbalance favoring sheep. A moderate approach allows for continued coexistence while ensuring that both populations can thrive. This adjustment also reflects a cautious response to the current wolf population, which is close to the sheep population, avoiding overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep. This adjustment reflects the need to respond to the current sheep population and the growing wolf numbers without risking over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.54, it indicates that we should be cautious about overhunting. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling our wolf population to thrive. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.99, which is only 26.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support our wolf population, but it also prioritizes the sustainability of the sheep, ensuring that we can coexist in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.96, which is only 20.9% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A gradual increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for sustainable coexistence as the sheep population can recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.55, which is only 16.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support our wolf population without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.92, which is only 14.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still being mindful of the need to avoid overhunting."
