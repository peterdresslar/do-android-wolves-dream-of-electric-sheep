            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and while I need to maintain hunting to support wolf reproduction, I must also allow the sheep population to recover. A moderate theta value will help balance the immediate need for food with the long-term sustainability of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A theta of 0.45 strikes a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species while avoiding over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can allow the sheep to replenish while ensuring the wolf population remains stable. This gradual approach will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A lower theta will help reduce competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to stabilize, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in sheep numbers, jeopardizing long-term sustainability. Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for a focus on competition with other wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that they are vulnerable to overhunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the sustainability of both populations. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance and prevents a crash in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and a slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain the balance while allowing for some recovery of the sheep. This adjustment is gradual, ensuring that we do not deplete the sheep too quickly while still supporting the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover and sustain their numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 94.21, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help sustain our wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",

However, with the wolf population at 70, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both populations can thrive. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition among wolves.",

This suggests that while I need to maintain some hunting to support wolf reproduction, I should also be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still recognizing the need for gradual hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.21, which is only 20.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a more cautious approach, balancing the need to hunt with the necessity of allowing the sheep population to recover. This adjustment also accounts for the growing wolf population, ensuring we do not overexert ourselves in hunting.",
