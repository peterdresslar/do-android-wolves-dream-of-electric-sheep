Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover and ensures the long-term survival of both species. Additionally, with the wolf population at a healthy level, it is prudent to focus on competition among wolves rather than overhunting.",

However, with the wolf population at 70, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both species can thrive. A slight reduction from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",

This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking the depletion of the sheep population, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
