            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 12\n- Sheep population: 18.80\n- Wolf population: 3.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.400\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 6.27 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 17.1% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for some hunting while prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 8.45, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring both populations can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 8.92, which is only 8.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for the sheep to recover. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to stabilize while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of avoiding sudden changes and promotes a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively low at 9.49, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sustainable coexistence. A moderate increase to 0.45 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the current needs of the wolf population with the health of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.11, which is only 9.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By adopting a lower theta, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.88, which is only 9.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.67, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment helps maintain a balance between ensuring wolf reproduction and allowing the sheep population to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.56, which is only 11.4% of its maximum capacity. While I want to ensure the survival of my pack, I also recognize the importance of allowing the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance between our populations, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.57, which is only 12.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still being mindful of the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.66, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously. A slight decrease in theta allows for a more balanced approach, ensuring that the sheep can recover while still allowing for some hunting to support the wolf population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level (14.5% of maximum capacity), which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking immediate depletion. This moderate increase will help support wolf reproduction while still allowing for some recovery of the sheep population. It is important to maintain a balance and avoid drastic changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.29, which is only 15.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is room for some hunting to support wolf reproduction, it is crucial to avoid overhunting to allow the sheep population to recover. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a more balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment reflects the need to balance our wolf population while still ensuring the sheep can recover and thrive."
