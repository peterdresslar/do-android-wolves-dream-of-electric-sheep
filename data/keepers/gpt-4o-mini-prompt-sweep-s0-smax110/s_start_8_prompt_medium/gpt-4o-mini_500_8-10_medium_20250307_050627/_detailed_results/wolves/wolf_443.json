            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. This moderate intensity will help sustain both the sheep and wolf populations, ensuring that we do not deplete the sheep too quickly while still allowing for some reproduction among wolves. It reflects a cautious strategy in response to the current ecosystem state.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 59.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population also being relatively high, a moderate approach is necessary to avoid over-depleting the sheep while allowing for some hunting to support wolf reproduction. This balance helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 70, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 37.15, which is only 33.8% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.40 helps maintain balance and allows for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.62, which is only 26.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for sustenance with the importance of not depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.21, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help sustain both the wolf and sheep populations while allowing for gradual recovery of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.75, which is only 16.1% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate hunting intensity will help balance our needs without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.41, which is only 14.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I can increase my hunting intensity slightly, I must do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate increase to 0.40 allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.32, which is only 12.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from the previous theta of 0.40 to 0.35, I can still maintain some hunting activity while prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.18, which is only 11.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. Given the current wolf population of 43, maintaining a lower theta will help balance competition among wolves while supporting the sheep"
