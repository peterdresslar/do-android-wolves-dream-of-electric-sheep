            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 432\n- Sheep population: 10.16\n- Wolf population: 25.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.300\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.41 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 9.2% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 94.10, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This value reflects a balanced approach, considering the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need to avoid over-depleting the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently healthy at 80.31, allowing for a moderate hunting approach. This will help maintain a balance between the wolf and sheep populations while avoiding overhunting. As the sheep population is at 73.0% of its maximum capacity, a slight reduction in hunting intensity will support sustainability and allow for gradual adjustments as conditions change.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep. This moderate approach will help maintain our wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 69, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both populations can thrive. A slight reduction in hunting intensity allows for a more sustainable balance while still enabling some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 36.68, which is only 33.3% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being mindful of the need for sheep recovery. A moderate increase from my previous theta of 0.400 will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep population too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.06, which is only 25.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is some room for hunting, it is important to avoid overexploitation. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain its health. This approach aligns with the wisdom of making gradual adjustments to ensure long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.96, which is only 20% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking immediate depletion of the sheep. By gradually increasing theta, I can support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.98, which is only 16.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to allow for recovery. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both sheep and wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.45, which is only 14.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach to hunting while still considering the need to compete with other wolves. This adjustment aims to support both the wolf population and the sheep population in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.45, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery. A moderate increase helps maintain balance as both populations are currently under pressure.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.02, which is only 10.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.22, which is only 10.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.64, which is only 9.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate increase to 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population and maintaining a balance with the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.33, which is only 9.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By focusing on competition with other wolves at this lower theta, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while avoiding over-depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.16, which is only 9.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a slight hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A small increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep further."
