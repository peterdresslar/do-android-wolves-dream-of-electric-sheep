            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 144\n- Sheep population: 23.17\n- Wolf population: 64.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.450\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.36 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 21.1% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at maximum capacity, and while I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A moderate hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, preventing over-depletion of the sheep while still allowing for some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively small. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in sheep, jeopardizing both their survival and our long-term sustainability. Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition with other wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively low. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover and ensures that we do not deplete our primary food source. This approach supports long-term coexistence and prevents potential crashes in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that we should be cautious with our hunting to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta reflects a need to adapt to the current conditions while still prioritizing the long-term survival of both our pack and the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep have a chance to increase in number again.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery. Maintaining a lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep while preventing overexploitation of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at its maximum capacity, and maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover and prevents overexploitation. This balance is crucial for the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, especially as the wolf population is relatively stable. Gradual adjustments will help us adapt to future changes.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery. Maintaining a lower theta helps ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, as it reduces pressure on the sheep population while allowing wolves to compete effectively with each other.",

A moderate increase to 0.40 allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery and avoiding overexploitation.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 56.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With the wolf population slightly higher than the sheep population, a moderate hunting intensity will allow for sustainable coexistence while also enabling the sheep to recover. This approach minimizes the risk of depleting the sheep too quickly and allows for a gradual adjustment as conditions change.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and while it is important to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to stabilize and grow, which is essential for long-term sustainability. This adjustment is small and gradual, aligning with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 29.01, which is only 26.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without risking a rapid depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.17, which is only 21.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.450 to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, focusing on sustainable coexistence while still considering the need for wolf population health."
