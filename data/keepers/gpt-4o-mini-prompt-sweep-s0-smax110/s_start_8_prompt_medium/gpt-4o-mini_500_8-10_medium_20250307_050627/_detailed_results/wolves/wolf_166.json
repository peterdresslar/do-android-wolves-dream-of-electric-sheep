            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that we should not increase hunting intensity further. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, enabling the sheep to recover while still supporting our wolf population. This gradual adjustment helps maintain a sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This approach helps maintain a balance in the ecosystem and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and a slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain the balance without depleting the sheep too quickly. This adjustment allows for sustainable coexistence while still considering the current wolf population and the need for gradual changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations while ensuring the long-term survival of both.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 99.37, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are enough sheep to sustain our hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a more balanced approach, ensuring that both populations can thrive while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 79.9% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 52, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 66.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.22, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 39.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 70, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both populations can thrive. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the trends in both populations, a moderate increase is prudent to ensure long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.28, which is only 23.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack without depleting the sheep too quickly, promoting a healthier balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.74, which is only 18.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach to hunting while still considering the need for sustainable coexistence as both populations fluctuate.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.35, which is only 15.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.93, which is only 13.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A moderate increase to 0.40 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for sustenance with the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.36, which is only 12.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.4 to 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need to compete with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to support wolf reproduction."
