            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 429\n- Sheep population: 11.22\n- Wolf population: 38.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.400\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.30 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 10.2% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still close to its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while ensuring that the sheep can recover. This adjustment helps maintain a healthy wolf population without risking a significant depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 94.10, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while maintaining a sustainable balance with the sheep population, which is currently at 85.5% of its maximum capacity.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is necessary to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly, and this theta value reflects a balanced approach.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain our wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining balance and responding to population trends.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate approach to hunting. This will help maintain a balance between the wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term survival for both. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity from the previous theta, I can adapt to the growing wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 36.68, which is only 33.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for a slight increase in hunting while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.06, which is only 25.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.35, I can focus more on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.96, which is only 20% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still being cautious. By raising theta to 0.40, I can help ensure the wolf population remains healthy without depleting the sheep too quickly, allowing for a more sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.98, which is only 16.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need to compete with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to support our population without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.45, which is only 14.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more moderate hunting intensity is needed to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain its health. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.35 to 0.40 allows for a slight increase in hunting without risking the depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.45, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low at 0.28. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep population further. A moderate increase to 0.35 allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition among wolves, ensuring a balance that supports both populations in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the wolf population is relatively high. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help sustain our pack while allowing the sheep to recover gradually. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of making small changes to maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.22, which is only 10.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting while prioritizing the long-term balance between our populations."
