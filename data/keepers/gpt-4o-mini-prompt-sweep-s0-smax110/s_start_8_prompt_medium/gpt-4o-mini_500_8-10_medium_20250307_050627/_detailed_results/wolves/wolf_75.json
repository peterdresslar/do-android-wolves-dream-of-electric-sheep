However, with the wolf population at 70, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to prevent a crash in the sheep population. A moderate increase in theta allows for some hunting while still considering the long-term balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.99, which is only 26.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I can increase hunting intensity, I need to do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.55 allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still giving sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.96, which is only 20.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.45 strikes a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.55, which is only 16.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. This gradual adjustment helps ensure long-term sustainability for both species.",

A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still recognizing the need for sustainable hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.53, which is only 10.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for wolf survival while giving sheep a chance to increase their numbers.",

A slight increase to 0.40 allows for a moderate hunting intensity that can help sustain my pack while still giving the sheep a chance to recover. This adjustment is small and aligns with the current trends in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.56, which is only 10.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done gradually to avoid depleting the sheep further.
