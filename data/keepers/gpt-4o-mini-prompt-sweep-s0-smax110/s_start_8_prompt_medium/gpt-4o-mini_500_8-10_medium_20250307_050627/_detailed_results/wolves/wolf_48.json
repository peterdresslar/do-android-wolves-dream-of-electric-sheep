However, I want to avoid overhunting as the wolf population is also growing, so a moderate increase in theta will help maintain balance and ensure sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help sustain wolf reproduction while still ensuring that the sheep population can recover and thrive. A gradual increase in theta reflects the need to balance our immediate hunting needs with the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the sheep population at 45.7% of its maximum capacity, I can afford to maintain a moderate hunting intensity to ensure that both the sheep and wolf populations can thrive without depleting resources too quickly. This adjustment allows for sustainable coexistence while still supporting the wolf population's needs.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that can support wolf reproduction while preventing over-depletion of the sheep. This approach balances the needs of both populations and aligns with the wisdom of making gradual adjustments.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.99, which is only 26.4% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.40 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the balance needed for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.96, which is only 20.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.55, which is only 16.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By adopting a lower theta, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize while still ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.92, which is only 14.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased slightly to support wolf reproduction, it is crucial to avoid overhunting to allow the sheep population to recover. A moderate increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach that considers both the immediate need for sustenance and the long-term health of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.86, which is only 12.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing our need for sustenance with the necessity of not depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.60, which is only 11.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a more balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.53, which is only 10.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover rather than intensifying hunting. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, reducing competition with other wolves while still considering the need for some hunting to support our population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.96, which is only 10.0% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain balance and prevent overhunting."
