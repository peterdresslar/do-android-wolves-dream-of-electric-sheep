            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and while I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A moderate hunting intensity will help maintain balance and prevent over-depletion of the sheep, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A slight decrease from my previous theta will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population does not decline too rapidly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover and prevent overexploitation. This lower theta will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem while avoiding potential crashes.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and a slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly. This adjustment allows for sustainable coexistence while also considering the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual increase is essential to avoid sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 94.21, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to ensure sustainable coexistence, given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need to avoid over-depleting the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment reflects a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while ensuring that the sheep population can recover and thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while still competing with other wolves. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking their long-term survival. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring that we can sustain ourselves while allowing the sheep to recover.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.75, which is only 16.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for sustenance with the long-term health of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.41, which is only 14.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is potential for recovery in the sheep population. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly to 0.40, I can still focus on hunting while allowing for some sheep recovery.
