            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 93.2% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while ensuring that the sheep population does not deplete too quickly. A gradual approach is essential to maintain balance and avoid sudden crashes in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 84.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.89, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the sheep-to-wolf ratio at 1.34, I can maintain a sustainable coexistence while ensuring that both populations can thrive. This moderate theta allows for gradual adjustments as conditions change, promoting long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the wolf population is also relatively high. A moderate hunting intensity will allow us to maintain a balance, ensuring that both populations can thrive without depleting the sheep too quickly. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of adapting to changing conditions while avoiding sudden shifts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 69, it is wise to maintain a cautious approach to hunting. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still ensuring the wolves can sustain themselves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 34.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both species can thrive. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that supports reproduction while preventing depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 29.01, which is only 26.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own wolf population. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, ensuring both species can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.17, which is only 21.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for increased hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. However, I want to avoid drastic changes, so a moderate increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.45 allows for a balanced approach.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.77, which is only 17.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need to compete with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to support wolf reproduction. This gradual adjustment helps maintain a sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.32, which is only 14.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need to adapt to the changing conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.17, which is only 12.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting theta to 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.90, which is only 11.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.78, which is only 10.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting to sustain the wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting long-term coexistence."
