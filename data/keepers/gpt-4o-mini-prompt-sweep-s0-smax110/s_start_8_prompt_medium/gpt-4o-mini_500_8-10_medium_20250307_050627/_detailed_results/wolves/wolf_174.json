            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 219\n- Sheep population: 12.11\n- Wolf population: 40.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.400\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.30 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 11.0% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. A lower theta allows for a focus on competition with other wolves, which can help reduce the wolf population slightly and give the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment is essential for maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 90.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 43, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to allow for recovery and coexistence. A moderate increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that supports both sheep and wolf populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 87.89, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while ensuring that the sheep population does not decline too rapidly. A gradual increase aligns with the current trends and maintains a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must do so gradually to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that considers both the current sheep population and the need to maintain a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 51.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.85, it is important to maintain a balance that allows the sheep to recover while also ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help sustain both populations without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still considering the long-term health of the sheep population. A gradual increase is prudent to avoid over-depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 30.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is potential for growth. With a wolf population of 70, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is low, suggesting that I should focus on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.28, which is only 23.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting without risking depletion. However, with a wolf population of 67.00, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.74, which is only 18.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is some opportunity for hunting, it is crucial to avoid overexploitation to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.35, which is only 15.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach that considers both immediate needs and long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.93, which is only 13.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.4 to 0.35, I can still maintain some hunting activity while prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of adapting to current conditions without risking a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.36, which is only 12.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some recovery of the sheep while still ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting sustainability without risking a crash in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.11, which is only 11.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a lower hunting intensity is needed to allow the sheep to recover. Additionally, with a wolf population of 40, it"
