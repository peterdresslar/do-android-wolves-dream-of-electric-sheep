            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 78\n- Sheep population: 10.96\n- Wolf population: 34.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.350\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.32 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 10.0% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still healthy at 104, allowing for some hunting to support wolf reproduction. However, since the wolf population is also growing, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to maintain balance. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 85.4% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while ensuring that the sheep population does not deplete too quickly. A gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual approach is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that can support both wolf reproduction and sheep recovery. This approach balances the need for immediate food with the long-term health of both populations, avoiding overexploitation while still allowing for growth.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 45.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 68, which is relatively high, I need to be cautious about overhunting. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain their population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery. A gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.99, which is only 26.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.40 allows for some hunting to sustain our population without depleting the sheep further, promoting a more sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that considers both the current sheep population and the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.55, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we are competing for limited resources. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while also giving sheep a chance to recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.92, which is only 14.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more moderate hunting approach is necessary to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain its health. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help balance the need for hunting with the sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.86, which is only 12.6% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity slightly to allow the sheep to recover. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.60, which is only 11.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need to adapt to the changing conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance while still considering the long-term survival of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.96, which is only 10% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to help sustain our wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of my pack."
