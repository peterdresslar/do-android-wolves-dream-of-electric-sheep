            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 235\n- Sheep population: 17.39\n- Wolf population: 6.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.400\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 2.90 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 15.8% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 39.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 70, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both populations can thrive. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 30.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.48, the wolves are competing for resources, and a slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still supporting the wolf population. This moderate approach helps maintain balance and avoids depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.28, which is only 23.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.74, which is only 18.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is an opportunity to hunt, I should focus on allowing the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the long-term balance between our populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we need to be cautious in our hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support our population while still prioritizing the sustainability of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.93, which is only 13.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.4 to 0.35 reflects a balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to support reproduction without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.36, which is only 12.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.11, which is only 11.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack while not over-depleting the sheep, promoting a more balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.40, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking over-depletion. This adjustment aims to support the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.83, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a balance and avoids depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low at 10.60, which is only 9.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for gradual hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.35 to 0.40, I can help ensure the wolf population remains healthy while still allowing the sheep to recover over time. This small adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.47, which is only 9.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and allowing the sheep population to stabilize, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.52, which is only 9.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while allowing the sheep population to stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.70, which is only 9.7% of its maximum capacity.

This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.27, which is only 10.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to ensure our own survival. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need to compete with other wolves and allowing the sheep population to stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be increased slightly to support wolf reproduction while still allowing for some recovery of the sheep population. This moderate increase helps maintain a balance without risking a rapid depletion of sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because it represents a moderate increase in hunting intensity. The sheep population is currently low at 12.23, allowing for some hunting without risking depletion. This adjustment also considers the growing wolf population, which requires a sustainable balance to ensure both species can thrive. A gradual increase helps maintain stability in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.80, which is only 11.6% of maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.51, which is only 12.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should maintain a moderate hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while still ensuring that our wolf population remains healthy. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 will help us adapt to the current conditions without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.28, which is only 13.0% of its maximum capacity. While I want to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I also recognize the need to allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, allowing for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.20, which is only 13.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I need to maintain some hunting to support wolf reproduction, I should also be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still being mindful of the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.21, which is only 14.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is some opportunity for hunting, it is important to be cautious and not over-deplete the sheep. A moderate theta of 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, enabling the wolf population to sustain itself while giving the sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.39, which is only 15.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for increased hunting intensity without risking immediate depletion of the sheep. However, I want to avoid drastic changes, so a small increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.45 allows for a balanced approach that can support both wolf reproduction and sheep recovery."
