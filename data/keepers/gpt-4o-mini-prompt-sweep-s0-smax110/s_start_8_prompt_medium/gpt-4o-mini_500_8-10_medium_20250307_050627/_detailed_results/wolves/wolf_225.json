A lower theta will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can stabilize, promoting long-term coexistence.",

A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring a balance that supports both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and a slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain the balance without depleting the sheep too quickly. This adjustment allows for sustainable coexistence while also supporting the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while ensuring that we do not deplete their numbers too quickly. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between our population and the sheep, allowing for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 96.23, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This approach balances the needs of both populations and avoids overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain the wolf population while still allowing sheep to recover. A moderate increase from my previous theta of 0.400 reflects a balanced approach, responding to the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and ensuring long-term coexistence.",

This adjustment will help maintain our population without over-depleting the sheep.",

This moderate adjustment will help maintain balance as the sheep population is recovering, while also considering the growing wolf numbers.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.00, which is only 24.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a focus on competition among wolves while still enabling some hunting, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.77, which is only 19.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased slightly to support wolf reproduction, it is crucial to avoid overhunting to allow the sheep population to recover. A moderate increase to 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for sustainable cycles.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.16, which is only 16.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population.
