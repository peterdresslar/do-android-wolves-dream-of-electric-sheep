            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 63.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.15, it suggests that the wolf population is relatively high compared to the sheep. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I will focus more on competition with other wolves to allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 51.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population being slightly higher than the sheep population, I need to focus on maintaining a balance. A moderate increase in theta allows for some hunting while ensuring that the sheep can recover and the wolf population does not deplete too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 68, which is relatively high, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that supports both sheep recovery and wolf population health.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.00, which is only 24.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, ensuring both species can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.77, which is only 19.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is some room for increased hunting, a moderate approach is necessary to avoid depleting the sheep further. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.4 to 0.45, I can help support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.16, which is only 16.5% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease from my previous theta will help balance hunting intensity with the need for sheep to regain numbers, promoting long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.83, which is only 14.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.4 to 0.35, I can maintain a focus on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.01, which is only 12.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.68, which is only 11.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our wolf population without depleting the sheep further, promoting a balanced ecosystem.",

To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.44, which is only 10.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.30 to 0.35, I can begin to take advantage of the sheep population while still allowing for recovery and avoiding competition with other wolves. This small adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.11, which is only 10.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach to hunting while still considering the need to compete with other wolves. This adjustment aims to support both the wolf population and the sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.01, which is only 10% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to stabilize while still competing with other wolves. This moderate approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.09, which is only 10.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting without risking the depletion of the sheep. By increasing theta slightly from 0.35 to 0.40, I can maintain a balanced approach that allows for some hunting while still considering the long-term survival of both species. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of responding to population trends.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.22, which is only 10.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover while also considering the growing wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.48, which is only 10.4% of its maximum capacity.
