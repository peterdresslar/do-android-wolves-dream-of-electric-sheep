This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while giving sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.62, which is only 26.0% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.21, which is only 20.2% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking the sheep population too severely. A gradual increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for sustainable coexistence while still addressing the needs of the wolf population.",

This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance.",

While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, a slight increase in hunting intensity will help us take advantage of the current sheep population without depleting it too quickly.
