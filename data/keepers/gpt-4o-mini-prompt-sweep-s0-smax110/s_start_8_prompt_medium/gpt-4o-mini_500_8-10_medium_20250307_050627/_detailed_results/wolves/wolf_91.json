A moderate theta allows for sustainable hunting while still considering the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A balanced approach will help maintain the sheep population while ensuring the wolf pack remains healthy. This adjustment reflects a gradual shift towards sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. A lower theta will help prevent overhunting and ensure a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and while I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at its maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition among wolves while giving the sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both populations.",

A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a moderate approach to hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring the sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating a need for cautious hunting to prevent depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery and sustainability of the sheep population. This approach helps maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 93.2% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still maintaining a balance that prevents over-depletion of the sheep population. A gradual increase is essential to ensure sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still healthy at 84% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover if needed. A gradual adjustment is key to maintaining balance.",

This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sustainable coexistence. A gradual increase will help maintain balance as both populations fluctuate.",

However, with the wolf population at 69, which is relatively high, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still supporting the wolf population.",

This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still considering the need to maintain a balance with the sheep population.
