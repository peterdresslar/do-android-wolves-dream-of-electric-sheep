            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly. It reflects a moderate approach that considers both the current state and the trends in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. Given the wolf population is relatively high, a moderate hunting intensity will allow for sustainable coexistence while also enabling the sheep to recover. This approach balances the need for wolf reproduction with the health of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 37.15, which is only 33.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I can increase hunting intensity, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight decrease in theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring both wolf and sheep populations can stabilize and thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.62, which is only 26.0% of its maximum capacity. While I want to increase hunting to support wolf reproduction, I must also be cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a more balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.21, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated. This value allows for a slight increase in hunting while still considering the need for sheep recovery, ensuring a sustainable balance as the wolf population is relatively high.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.75, which is only 16.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and allowing the sheep population to stabilize, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.41, which is only 14.0% of its maximum capacity. While I need to focus on hunting to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting sustainable coexistence while still addressing the needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.32, which is only 12.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.18, which is only 11.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover.
