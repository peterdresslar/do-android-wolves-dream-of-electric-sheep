This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without risking depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.375 allows for more hunting to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious about the sheep population",

To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still competing with other wolves. A moderate theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance that supports the sheep",
