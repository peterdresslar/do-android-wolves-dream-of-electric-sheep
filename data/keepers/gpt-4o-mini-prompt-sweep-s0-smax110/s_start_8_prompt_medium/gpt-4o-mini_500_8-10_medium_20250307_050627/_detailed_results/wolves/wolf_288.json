            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that we should not increase hunting intensity too much to avoid depleting their numbers. A moderate approach allows for some hunting while still giving sheep a chance to recover and maintain a balance in the ecosystem. This way, we can ensure the long-term survival of both our pack and the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. With a high sheep-to-wolf ratio and a growing wolf population, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery. Maintaining a lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, as it prevents overhunting and allows the sheep population to stabilize.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep to recover, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery and prevent depletion. Maintaining a focus on competition with other wolves will help stabilize our population while ensuring the sheep can bounce back.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery and prevent depletion. Maintaining a focus on competition with other wolves will help stabilize our population while ensuring the sheep can bounce back.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and a slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain the balance without depleting the sheep too quickly. This adjustment allows for sustainable coexistence while still considering the current wolf population and the need for gradual changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while ensuring that the sheep can recover. This adjustment supports the long-term survival of both species and maintains a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 96.43, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are enough sheep to support a moderate increase in hunting intensity. However, I want to avoid overexploitation, so a slight increase from my previous theta allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling the wolf population to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is necessary to maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while it is beneficial to increase hunting slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must also consider the potential for overhunting. A moderate adjustment allows for a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for some hunting without risking depletion. Given the wolf population is also relatively high, a slight reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and allow both populations to stabilize. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of avoiding sudden changes and promoting sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery. A gradual increase is essential to avoid depleting the sheep population too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 30.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.50, I need to be cautious about overhunting to ensure the long-term survival of both species. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.37, which is only 24.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I can increase my hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate increase to 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.93, which is only 19.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased slightly, it is crucial to prioritize the recovery of the sheep population to ensure long-term sustainability. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still focusing on the competition among wolves, which is necessary given the current wolf population of 62. This approach helps maintain balance and prevents overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.59, which is only 16.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species."
