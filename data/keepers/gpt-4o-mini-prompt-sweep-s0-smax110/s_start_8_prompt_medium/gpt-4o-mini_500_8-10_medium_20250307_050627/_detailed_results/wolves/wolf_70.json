            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly, as we need to balance our needs with the ecosystem",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 34.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 70, which is relatively high, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight reduction from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring both populations can thrive without depleting resources too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.99, which is only 26.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still enabling the sheep population to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.96, which is only 20.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity from 0.45 to 0.40, I can focus on maintaining a balance between competing with other wolves and allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of avoiding sudden changes and promotes long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.55, which is only 16.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring a balance that supports both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.92, which is only 14.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I need to be cautious about overhunting, I can afford to increase my hunting intensity slightly to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.86, which is only 12.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting a lower theta, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize while still ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.60, which is only 11.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without risking the sheep population too severely. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that promotes coexistence while still addressing the needs of the wolf pack.",

This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves and allow the sheep population to stabilize, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.41, which is only 9.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should be cautious with our hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.39, which is only 9.4% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 will help balance competition with other wolves and give the sheep a chance to increase their numbers without depleting their population further.",

A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.18, which is only 12.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to stabilize while still competing with other wolves. This moderate approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species."
