            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 359\n- Sheep population: 12.23\n- Wolf population: 40.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.450\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.31 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 11.1% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and my previous theta was quite low. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover. A gradual increase in theta will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and a moderate increase in hunting intensity will allow for sustainable coexistence while still enabling the wolf population to thrive. This gradual adjustment helps to balance the needs of both species without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain the wolf population while still ensuring the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual increase aligns with the current trends and avoids sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to ensure sustainability, as the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we should not overhunt at this time.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a sustainable balance. This adjustment reflects the need to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 39.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 68, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing sheep to recover. A gradual increase is prudent given the current dynamics.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.37, which is only 24.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I can increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while still considering the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.93, which is only 19.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is potential for recovery if I reduce hunting intensity slightly. By increasing theta from 0.40 to 0.45, I can maintain a balance that allows for some hunting while also giving sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.59, which is only 16.0% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing competition with other wolves, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.21, which is only 13.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring both populations can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.57, which is only 12.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the immediate needs of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.23, which is only 11.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species."
