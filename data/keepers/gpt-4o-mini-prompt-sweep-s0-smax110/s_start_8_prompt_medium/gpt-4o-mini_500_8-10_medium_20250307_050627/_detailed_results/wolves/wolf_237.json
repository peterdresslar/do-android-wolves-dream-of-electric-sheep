            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 288\n- Sheep population: 12.68\n- Wolf population: 40.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.400\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.32 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 11.5% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 3.79, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. A slight increase in hunting intensity will allow for some reproduction while still giving the sheep a chance to recover. This approach helps maintain a balance without risking a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring sustainable coexistence while also supporting the growth of the wolf pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 96.23, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while maintaining a sustainable balance. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 84.31, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. However, with the wolf population at 53.00, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing sheep to recover. It reflects a balanced approach, responding to the current conditions and trends.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight reduction in hunting intensity. This will help ensure the sheep can recover while still allowing for some hunting to maintain the wolf population. A gradual adjustment is key to sustaining both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 68, which is relatively high, I need to be cautious not to overhunt. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that supports both reproduction and the recovery of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 31.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.51, it suggests that while hunting can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27, which is only 24.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without risking depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for more effective hunting while still being cautious, as the wolf population is relatively high at 66. I aim to maintain a balance that supports both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.77, which is only 19.8% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a focus on competition with other wolves, a lower theta value will help balance the ecosystem. This approach supports the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.16, which is only 16.5% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still being cautious. A moderate increase to 0.40 will help maintain a balance, allowing for some reproduction among wolves without depleting the sheep too quickly. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of responding to population trends.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.83, which is only 14.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, reducing pressure on the sheep while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.01, which is only 12.7% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.35 aligns with the wisdom of making small adjustments and maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.68, which is only 11.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from the previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35, I can still maintain some hunting activity while prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both populations. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance."
