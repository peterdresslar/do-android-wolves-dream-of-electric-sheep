            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 99.37, allowing for some increased hunting intensity without risking depletion. However, I want to avoid overhunting, as the wolf population is also significant at 43.00. This moderate increase will help maintain a balance while ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 87.89, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment helps ensure the wolf population can thrive while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual approach is essential to maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 66.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 60, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure our long-term survival. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance while allowing for some recovery of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the sheep population at 51.9% of maximum capacity, I can maintain a sustainable hunting intensity while ensuring the wolf population does not grow too rapidly. This adjustment allows for continued coexistence and prevents over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 39.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 70, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to prevent a crash. A slight reduction from my previous theta allows for continued hunting while also considering the need for balance as wolf numbers grow.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports both wolf reproduction and sheep recovery. This adjustment reflects a balanced approach, considering the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need to avoid overhunting while still ensuring the health of our pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.28, which is only 23.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.450 to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, focusing on sustainable coexistence while still considering the need for wolf population health.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.74, which is only 18.9% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A moderate adjustment helps maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep can recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.35, which is only 15.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting a lower theta, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to gradually increase while ensuring our own numbers remain stable. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I need to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.36, which is only 12.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for wolves to hunt while also considering the long-term sustainability of both populations. It allows for slight hunting while prioritizing the recovery of sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the wolf population is relatively high. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help sustain our numbers while allowing the sheep to recover gradually. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance, ensuring both species can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.40, which is only 10.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for the sheep to recover. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to stabilize while still competing with other wolves. This approach aligns with my goal of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.83, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting."
