Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves and allow the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep further.",

With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 3.79, it is crucial to focus on competition among wolves to ensure our long-term survival while preventing overhunting of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and while it is important to increase hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, a gradual approach is necessary to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. This slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced strategy that considers both the current sheep population and the need for sustainable coexistence.",

This adjustment allows for sustainable coexistence while also supporting the wolf population",

This adjustment reflects a balanced approach, enabling us to sustain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. Gradual changes are essential to maintain harmony in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, and while it is beneficial to increase hunting intensity, I must also consider the growing wolf population. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow sheep to recover while still supporting wolf reproduction. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.4% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment helps maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring both can thrive in the long term.",

This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight reduction in hunting intensity allows for a more sustainable balance, giving sheep a chance to recover while still enabling the wolf population to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27, which is only 24.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.4 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.77, which is only 19.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing competition with other wolves.
