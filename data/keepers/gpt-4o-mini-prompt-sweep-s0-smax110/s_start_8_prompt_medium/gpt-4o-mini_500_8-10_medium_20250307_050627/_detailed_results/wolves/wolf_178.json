            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. A moderate hunting intensity will allow for some sheep depletion while still enabling their recovery, ensuring a sustainable balance between both populations. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and maintaining coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 90.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain the balance between wolf and sheep populations while avoiding overexploitation. This approach allows for gradual adjustments as conditions change.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 79.9% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep. This moderate adjustment will help sustain both populations without risking a rapid decline in sheep numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment reflects a balance between ensuring the wolf population remains healthy while allowing the sheep to recover gradually.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 51.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. However, the wolf population is relatively high, so I need to balance hunting with competition among wolves. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining enough food for the wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 30.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 70, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.28, which is only 23.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the immediate needs of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.74, which is only 18.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for sustainable cycles.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.35, which is only 15.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack without depleting the sheep further, promoting a healthier balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.93, which is only 13.6% of its maximum capacity. Given the high wolf population of 51.00, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.36, which is only 12.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.30 to 0.35, I can maintain a focus on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, which will help balance the populations without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.11, which is only 11.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that considers both the immediate need for food and the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.40, which is only 10.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is potential for recovery if I reduce my hunting intensity slightly. A theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain my pack"
