            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates potential stress on the sheep. A moderate hunting intensity will allow for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This approach balances the needs of both populations and avoids overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that considers both the current sheep population and the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 8.92, which is only 8.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while maintaining a healthy wolf population. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help balance our needs with the sustainability of the ecosystem."
