            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 206\n- Sheep population: 109.69\n- Wolf population: 32.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.445\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 3.43 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 99.7% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still ensuring that the wolf population remains healthy. This approach balances the need for sustenance with the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term survival for both.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while ensuring that the sheep can recover. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 87.89, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are enough sheep to sustain our pack without overhunting. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a more cautious approach, ensuring that we do not deplete the sheep population while still allowing for some hunting to support our growth.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still being mindful of the wolf population growth. This adjustment helps maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring enough food for future generations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 51.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 67, I need to be cautious about overhunting. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 39.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 70, it is wise to avoid overhunting to prevent a decline in sheep numbers and ensure our long-term survival. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach while still being cautious.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 30.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 70, it is important to avoid overhunting to prevent a crash in the sheep population. A slight decrease in hunting intensity allows for a more sustainable balance while still ensuring the wolf population can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.28, which is only 23.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without risking the depletion of the sheep population. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still being mindful of the need to compete with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.74, which is only 18.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is some opportunity for hunting, it is crucial to avoid overexploitation to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting while still prioritizing the long-term balance between the wolf and sheep populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.35, which is only 15.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.93, which is only 13.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased slightly, it is important to prioritize the recovery of the sheep population to ensure long-term sustainability. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still focusing on the competition among wolves, which is necessary given the current wolf population of 51. This approach aims to maintain a balance that supports both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.36, which is only 12.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting without risking immediate depletion. However, with a wolf population of 46, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure our long-term survival. A slight increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting sustainability while still addressing the needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.11, which is only 11.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting while prioritizing the long-term balance between our populations."
