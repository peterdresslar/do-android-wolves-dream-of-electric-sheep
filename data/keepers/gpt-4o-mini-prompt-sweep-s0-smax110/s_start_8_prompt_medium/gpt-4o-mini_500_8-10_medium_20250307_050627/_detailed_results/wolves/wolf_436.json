            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and my previous theta was quite low. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover while also managing competition with other wolves. A gradual increase in theta will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is very close to its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while preventing overhunting, ensuring a sustainable balance between both populations. This gradual adjustment will help maintain the ecosystem",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is close to its maximum capacity, indicating that they are abundant. However, the wolf population is also significant, so I need to maintain a balance. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help sustain our population while allowing sheep to recover without depleting them too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, I must remain cautious and avoid overhunting, as the wolf population is also significant. A gradual increase will help maintain balance and ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction without overly depleting the sheep, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid destabilizing the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 70, I need to be cautious and avoid over-hunting to ensure both species can thrive. A moderate adjustment to 0.45 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 37.15, which is only 33.8% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.62, which is only 26.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that I can afford to increase my hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction while still allowing for sheep recovery. A moderate increase to 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, ensuring that both populations can thrive without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.21, which is only 20.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I can increase my hunting intensity, I should do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for sustainable coexistence while still considering the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.75, which is only 16.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should prioritize the recovery of the sheep population while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our own health. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, ensuring that we do not over-deplete the sheep while also competing effectively with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.41, which is only 14.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.32, which is only 12.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and allowing the sheep population to stabilize, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.18, which is only 11.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I need to be cautious about overhunting, I can afford to increase my hunting intensity slightly to help sustain the wolf population. A moderate increase to 0.40 allows for a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly."
