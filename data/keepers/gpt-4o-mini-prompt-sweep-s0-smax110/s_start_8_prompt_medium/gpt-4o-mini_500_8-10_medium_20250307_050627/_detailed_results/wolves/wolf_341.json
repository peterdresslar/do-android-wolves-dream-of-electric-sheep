            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 39.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will allow for a balanced approach, supporting wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 33.91, which is only 30.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a more balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level (24.0% of maximum capacity), and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we are competing for resources. A moderate theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while also giving sheep a chance to recover. This balance is crucial for the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.93, which is only 19.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.59, which is only 16.0% of its maximum capacity. While I need to maintain a balance between hunting and competing with other wolves, a slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted to ensure the wolf population can thrive. However, I must be cautious and avoid drastic changes, so a moderate increase to 0.40 allows for sustainable coexistence while still addressing the immediate needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.21, which is only 13.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring a balance that supports both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.57, which is only 12.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach that can support both populations while avoiding drastic changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the wolf population is relatively high. A moderate hunting intensity allows for some hunting while giving sheep a chance to recover. This approach helps maintain a balance, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.56, which is only 10.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain our wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing our needs.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.01, which is only 10% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for wolf survival while ensuring the sheep population can stabilize and grow.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.83, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and my previous theta was already on the lower end. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for a modest increase in hunting intensity, which can help sustain my pack while still allowing the sheep population to recover. This approach balances the need for food with the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.02, which is only 10% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable balance, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting. This lower theta will help stabilize both populations in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.29, which is only 10.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is an opportunity to increase hunting intensity slightly without risking the sheep",
