            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 361\n- Sheep population: 11.01\n- Wolf population: 31.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.400\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.36 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 10.0% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3. Adjust your hunting intensity gradually in response to population changes\n4. Find a balance that creates sustainable cycles rather than crashes\n5.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently healthy at 96.43, which is close to their maximum capacity. This allows for a moderate increase in hunting intensity to ensure the wolf population can thrive without depleting the sheep too quickly. A theta of 0.35 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for sustainable coexistence while still addressing the needs of the wolf pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, given the wolf population is also significant, I want to ensure we don",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery. A moderate increase aligns with the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and promotes a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for some hunting without risking depletion. Given the wolf population is also relatively high, a slight reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and allow both populations to stabilize. This approach aligns with the wisdom of making gradual adjustments to ensure long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population while still considering the need for sustainable coexistence with the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 30.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. This moderate approach aligns with the wisdom of balancing competition with sustainable hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 24.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach to hunting while still being mindful of the growing wolf population. This adjustment aims to ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.93, which is only 19.0% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.59, which is only 16.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the immediate needs of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.21, which is only 13.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting a theta of 0.35, I can focus more on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This gradual adjustment helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.57, which is only 12.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting without risking depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.23, which is only 11.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 to 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for wolf survival while ensuring the sheep population can stabilize and grow.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be increased slightly to support wolf reproduction while still allowing for some recovery of the sheep population. A gradual increase helps maintain balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.01, which is only 10.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own population. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, ensuring both our survival and the sheep"
