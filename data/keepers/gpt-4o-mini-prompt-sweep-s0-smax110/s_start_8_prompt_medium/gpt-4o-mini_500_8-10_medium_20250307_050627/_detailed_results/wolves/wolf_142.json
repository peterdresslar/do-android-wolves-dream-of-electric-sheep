            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports our wolf population while still considering the long-term health of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 29.01, which is only 26.4% of its maximum capacity. While I want to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I need to be cautious about overhunting the sheep. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while also giving the sheep a chance to recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.17, which is only 21.1% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing competition with other wolves. A moderate theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance, allowing for some hunting while prioritizing the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.77, which is only 17.1% of its maximum capacity. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a modest increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep further. This adjustment reflects a balanced approach to ensure both populations can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.32, which is only 14.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly, considering the current wolf population is also significant.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.17, which is only 12.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to allow the sheep population to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep.",
