            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to prevent depletion. A theta of 0.5 allows for a balanced approach, ensuring that both sheep and wolves can thrive without risking a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution in hunting to prevent depletion. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while prioritizing the competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. With a high sheep-to-wolf ratio and a growing wolf population, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for a focus on competition with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and I need to allow for some recovery while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. This small increase from my previous theta will help balance the needs of both wolves and sheep, ensuring sustainability without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high at 104, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 39, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 93.96, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a sustainable balance. This adjustment reflects the need to support wolf reproduction without over-depleting the sheep population, which is crucial for long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term health of both the sheep and wolf populations. This moderate adjustment reflects the need to balance competition with other wolves and the availability of prey, ensuring we do not over-deplete the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment reflects a balance between ensuring the wolf population can thrive while still allowing sheep to recover and maintain their numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a sustainable balance. This adjustment will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, as it allows for gradual adaptation to the current conditions without risking a sudden depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population also being relatively high, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A moderate increase to 0.45 allows for some growth in the wolf population while still ensuring the sheep can recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.99, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are not enough sheep to sustain a higher hunting intensity. A slight decrease in theta allows for a more balanced approach, enabling the sheep population to recover while still allowing for some hunting to support the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.96, which is only 20.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our needs without depleting the sheep further, promoting a balance that can lead to long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.55, which is only 16.9% of its maximum capacity. Increasing my hunting intensity slightly to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach that can help sustain both the sheep and wolf populations. This small adjustment acknowledges the need for wolves to reproduce while still allowing the sheep population to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.92, which is only 14.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting strategy to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without over-depleting the sheep, promoting a sustainable balance."
