            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 77\n- Sheep population: 11.53\n- Wolf population: 38.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.400\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.30 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 10.5% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the sheep population at 94.5% of its maximum capacity, a moderate theta will help sustain both sheep and wolf populations while allowing for gradual adjustments as conditions change. This approach will support long-term survival and prevent over-depletion of sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still healthy at 93.96, allowing for a moderate hunting approach. This will help maintain a sustainable balance while ensuring that the wolf population can thrive without over-depleting the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction without risking the depletion of the sheep population. A moderate approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while it is beneficial to increase hunting intensity slightly, I must remain cautious to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A theta of 0.40 allows for a moderate increase in hunting while still prioritizing the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without overly depleting the sheep population, ensuring long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 34.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 70, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.99, which is only 26.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain its health.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.96, which is only 20.9% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A moderate adjustment helps maintain balance and allows for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.55, which is only 16.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.400 to 0.35, I can maintain a balance that focuses on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively low at 15.92, which is only 14.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.86, which is only 12.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from the previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35, I can still maintain some hunting activity while prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of avoiding sudden changes and responding to the current state of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.60, which is only 11.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased slightly to support wolf reproduction, it is crucial to avoid overexploitation of the sheep. A gradual increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.53, which is only 10.5% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for hunting with the necessity of not depleting the sheep further."
