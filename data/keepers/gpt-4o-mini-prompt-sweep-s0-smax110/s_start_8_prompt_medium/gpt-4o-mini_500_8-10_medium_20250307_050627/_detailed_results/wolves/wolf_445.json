            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still close to its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while ensuring that the sheep can sustain their numbers. This adjustment helps maintain a healthy wolf population without risking a rapid depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 94.21, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep do not become over-depleted. A gradual increase is necessary to maintain balance and avoid sudden fluctuations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual adjustment is key to maintaining balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the sheep-to-wolf ratio being close to 1, I want to maintain a steady hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep population can recover and thrive. This moderate adjustment allows for flexibility in response to future changes in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, and while it is beneficial to increase hunting intensity as their numbers rise, the wolf population is also significant. A theta of 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting to support wolf reproduction. This gradual adjustment helps avoid over-depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 37.15, which is only 33.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support our reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that considers both the need for wolf population sustainability and the recovery of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.62, which is only 26.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack without depleting the sheep further, promoting a more balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.21, which is only 20.2% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still being cautious. A gradual increase to 0.40 helps maintain a balance between hunting and allowing the sheep population to recover, while also considering the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.75, which is only 16.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.4 to 0.35, I can still maintain some hunting activity while prioritizing the long-term survival of both species. This moderate adjustment reflects the need to balance competition with other wolves and the sustainability of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.41, which is only 14.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without over-depleting the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.32, which is only 12.1% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 reflects a more cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.18, which is only 11.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are struggling, and if I increase my hunting intensity too much, it could lead to their depletion and ultimately harm the wolf population as well. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem."
