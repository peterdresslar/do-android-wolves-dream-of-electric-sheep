            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover and prevent overexploitation. This moderate approach will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers, jeopardizing the long-term survival of both species. Maintaining a lower theta allows for a focus on competition with other wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be cautiously increased to prevent over-depletion. However, given the current wolf population and the need for sustainable coexistence, a slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach while still considering the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 3.93, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in sheep numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that a slight increase in hunting intensity is appropriate to ensure the wolf population can thrive. However, I must be cautious and avoid drastic changes, as the wolf population is still relatively low. A gradual increase allows for sustainable coexistence while still addressing the needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",

This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to ensure that both sheep and wolf populations can thrive without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction without over-depleting the sheep, ensuring both populations can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.70, I need to be cautious about increasing hunting intensity too much, as the wolf population is already significant. A slight decrease in theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring both populations can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 37.15, which is only 33.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for increased hunting intensity without risking immediate depletion. However, with the wolf population at 71.00, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight increase to 0.45 allows for sustainable hunting while still considering the long-term health of both populations.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.75, which is only 16.1% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, it is important to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing competition among wolves, which will help stabilize the ecosystem.",

This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly.
