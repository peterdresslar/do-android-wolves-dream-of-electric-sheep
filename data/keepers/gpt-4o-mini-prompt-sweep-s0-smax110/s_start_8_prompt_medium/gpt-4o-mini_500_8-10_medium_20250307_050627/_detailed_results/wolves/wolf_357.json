            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting, ensuring both wolves and sheep can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover and prevent overexploitation. This moderate approach will help maintain a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at its maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at its maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery. Maintaining a lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, as it prevents overhunting and allows the sheep population to stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and a slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted to ensure our survival and reproduction. However, I must remain cautious and avoid drastic changes, as the wolf population is still relatively low. A moderate increase allows for sustainable coexistence while keeping an eye on both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. A moderate increase to 0.4 will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover if needed.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 94.10, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain our wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of my ancestors, promoting a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and my previous theta of 0.55 was slightly aggressive. A small reduction to 0.50 allows for continued hunting while also giving the sheep a chance to recover, ensuring a balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, focusing on maintaining both wolf and sheep populations while being cautious of the growing wolf numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 36.68, which is only 33.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species and avoid depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.06, which is only 25.5% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious to avoid over-depleting the sheep. A moderate increase from my previous theta of 0.400 helps maintain a balance, allowing for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.96, which is only 20% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on the competition with other wolves, ensuring a balanced approach.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.98, which is only 16.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support our needs without depleting the sheep population further, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
