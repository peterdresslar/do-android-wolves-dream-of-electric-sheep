With a high sheep-to-wolf ratio and a growing wolf population, focusing on competition among wolves will help maintain balance and prevent over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. With a high sheep-to-wolf ratio, focusing on competition among wolves will help stabilize the wolf population while giving sheep a chance to rebound.",

By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while ensuring the sheep population has a chance to stabilize, which is crucial for long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 5.00, it is crucial to focus on competition among wolves to prevent overhunting and ensure long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing the sheep population to stabilize, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery. Maintaining a lower theta helps ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, preventing overhunting and promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population also present, I must be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both species can thrive. A moderate increase to 0.40 allows for sustainable coexistence while still addressing the needs of the wolf pack.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing coexistence. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to maintain balance, as the sheep are recovering but not yet at maximum capacity. A moderate theta helps ensure that both populations can thrive without risking depletion.",

This adjustment reflects the need to support wolf reproduction without over-depleting the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while it is beneficial to increase hunting intensity as the sheep population grows, I must also consider the current wolf population. With both populations being similar, a slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow for better competition among wolves while still enabling some hunting to maintain our numbers. This approach supports long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating there is room for sustainable hunting.

A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the long-term health of the sheep.",

This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still being mindful of the sheep",

While I want to ensure the survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to be cautious about hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in theta will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and allowing the sheep population to stabilize.",
