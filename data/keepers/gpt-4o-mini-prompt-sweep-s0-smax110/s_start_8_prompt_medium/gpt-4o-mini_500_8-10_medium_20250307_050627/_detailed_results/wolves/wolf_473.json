            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 49.20, allowing for some hunting without risking depletion. However, the wolf population is also significant at 70.00, so a slight reduction in hunting intensity is warranted to ensure we don",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 37.15, which is only 33.8% of its maximum capacity. While I need to maintain some hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must also be cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. A moderate increase to 0.70 allows for sustainable hunting while still considering the need for balance as the wolf population is relatively high.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.62, which is only 26.0% of its maximum capacity. While my previous theta of 0.700 was effective for reproduction, it risks depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.60 allows for sustainable hunting while also considering the need for sheep recovery and the current wolf population of 70. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 20.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without risking depletion. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring that both the sheep and wolf populations can thrive together while also considering the recent growth in wolf numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.75, which is only 16.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to allow the sheep to recover, so I will focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting. A moderate theta of 0.40 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.41, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.32, which is only 12.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still recognizing the need to adapt to the current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.18, which is only 11.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.4 to 0.35, I can maintain a focus on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring the long-term survival of both species."
