            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution in hunting to prevent depletion. A moderate approach allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some hunting to support the wolf population. This adjustment reflects a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep can recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. A lower theta will help balance competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to stabilize, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that we can afford to increase our hunting intensity slightly without risking a crash in the sheep population. This adjustment allows for a sustainable balance while also supporting the growth of our wolf pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 94.5% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 93.96, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to maintain balance, as the wolf population is also growing. A slight decrease from my previous theta will help prevent overhunting and promote sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while still maintaining a balance that allows sheep to recover. It reflects a cautious approach to ensure long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while I want to ensure my pack thrives, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and prevent depletion of the sheep population, which is crucial for long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight reduction from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring both populations can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.99, which is only 26.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.4 allows for more hunting intensity while still being cautious, as the wolf population is relatively high at 69. I aim to maintain a balance that supports both species in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.96, which is only 20.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A slight decrease from my previous theta of 0.45 will help balance our needs without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.55, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking their long-term survival. This adjustment will help maintain a balance as the sheep population is recovering, while also considering the growing wolf population. A gradual increase in theta allows for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.92, which is only 14.5% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also competing with other wolves. A moderate theta of 0.35 strikes a balance between hunting and competition, promoting sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.86, which is only 12.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some recovery while still ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach, promoting coexistence without risking a rapid depletion of the sheep."
