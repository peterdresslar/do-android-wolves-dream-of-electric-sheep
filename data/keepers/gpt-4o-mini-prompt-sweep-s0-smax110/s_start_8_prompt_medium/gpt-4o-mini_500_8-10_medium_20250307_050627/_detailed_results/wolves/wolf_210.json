            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 39.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for recovery. With a wolf population of 70, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is low, suggesting that we should focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensifying hunting. This will allow the sheep population to stabilize and recover while ensuring our own long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 33.51, which is only 30.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more moderate hunting intensity is appropriate to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain its health. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.25 will help balance the needs of both species without risking a sudden depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.28, which is only 23.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting without risking depletion. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.35 to 0.40, I can help ensure the wolf population remains healthy while still allowing the sheep to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.74, which is only 18.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.35, which is only 15.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I need to maintain some hunting to support wolf reproduction, I should also be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still acknowledging the need for wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.93, which is only 13.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack without depleting the sheep further, promoting a healthier balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.36, which is only 12.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting without risking depletion. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.35 to 0.40, I can begin to take advantage of the sheep population while still allowing for recovery and maintaining a sustainable balance with the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.11, which is only 11.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for sustenance with the health of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.40, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a balance as the sheep population recovers, while also supporting the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.83, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.60, which is only 9.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach to hunting while still being mindful of the wolf population, which is relatively high at 28. This adjustment aims to promote coexistence and prevent future crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.47, which is only 9.5% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining some hunting to support our wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",
