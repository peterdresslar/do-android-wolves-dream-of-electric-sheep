            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 218\n- Sheep population: 13.36\n- Wolf population: 46.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.350\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.29 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 12.1% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and a slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain the balance while allowing for some recovery of the sheep. This adjustment is moderate enough to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that we should maintain a balanced approach to hunting. A moderate theta allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves. This way, we can avoid depleting the sheep population too quickly and ensure our long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 90.3% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate hunting approach. This will help maintain a balance between the wolf and sheep populations while avoiding over-depletion of the sheep. As the wolf population is also growing, a slight reduction in hunting intensity will support sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 87.89, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we can afford to be cautious. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover further while still enabling us to maintain a healthy wolf population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring the long-term survival of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, and while I want to ensure the wolves can reproduce, I also need to allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance between the two populations, preventing overexploitation of the sheep while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing sheep to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 30.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 70, it is wise to avoid overhunting to prevent a crash in the sheep population. A slight decrease in hunting intensity allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.28, which is only 23.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for more hunting to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious to avoid overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.74, which is only 18.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.375 strikes a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep can rebound, aligning with the wisdom of gradual adjustments.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.35, which is only 15.8% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A moderate approach will help maintain balance as both populations adjust.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.93, which is only 13.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By lowering my hunting intensity slightly, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, promoting a healthier balance in the ecosystem.",
