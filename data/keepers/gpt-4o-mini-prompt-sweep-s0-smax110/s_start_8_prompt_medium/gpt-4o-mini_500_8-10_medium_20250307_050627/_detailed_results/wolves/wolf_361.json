            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. A lower theta will help balance competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to repopulate, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in sheep numbers, jeopardizing long-term sustainability. A moderate approach allows for some hunting while giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery. Maintaining a lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep while preventing overexploitation of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is very close to its maximum capacity, and while I need to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is close to its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 85.5% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 47, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. It reflects a balanced approach to coexistence, responding to the current conditions without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight decrease in hunting intensity. This will help maintain the balance between the wolf and sheep populations while still allowing for some hunting to support wolf reproduction. A moderate approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.70, a moderate approach allows for a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 36.68, which is only 33.3% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain balance without risking a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.06, which is only 25.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.96, which is only 20% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our needs without depleting the sheep further, promoting a healthier balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.98, which is only 16.3% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking immediate depletion of the sheep. A gradual increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for some hunting while still considering the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.45, which is only 14.0% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for wolf sustenance with the necessity of sheep population recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.45, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a sustainable balance. This adjustment will help support the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A gradual increase is essential to avoid sudden crashes in either population."
