A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still ensuring that the wolf population remains healthy. This approach aligns with the wisdom of making gradual adjustments to maintain balance in the ecosystem.",

This indicates that we need to allow the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population.

This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover.
