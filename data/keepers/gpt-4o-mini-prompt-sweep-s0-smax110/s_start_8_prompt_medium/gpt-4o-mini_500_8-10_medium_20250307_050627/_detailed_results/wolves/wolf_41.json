            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 64\n- Sheep population: 108.84\n- Wolf population: 33.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.758\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 3.30 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 98.9% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that they can sustain a bit more hunting without risking depletion. However, with the wolf population also present, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A moderate increase in hunting intensity allows for some reproduction while still considering the long-term balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 104, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This balance helps maintain a sustainable ecosystem without risking a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 85.4% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This value balances the need to sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive, avoiding overhunting that could lead to a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity. This will help maintain a balance between the wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term survival for both. Gradually reducing hunting intensity will also allow the sheep to recover while keeping the wolf population healthy.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep too quickly. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring both populations can thrive together.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly. It reflects a cautious approach to ensure both species can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 34.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 70, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.99, which is only 26.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population and maintaining a balance with the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.96, which is only 20.9% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.35 helps maintain balance and allows for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.55, which is only 16.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for sustenance with the importance of not depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.92, which is only 14.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.86, which is only 12.6% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. This approach will help balance the ecosystem and prevent over-depletion of sheep, while also considering the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.60, which is only 11.5% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking the depletion of the sheep. By gradually increasing theta, I can ensure that the wolf population remains healthy while still allowing the sheep to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.53, which is only 10.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 will help maintain a balance while still allowing for some hunting, as the wolf population is relatively high. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both species."
