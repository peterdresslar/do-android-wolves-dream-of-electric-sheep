This will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is necessary to maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 51.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. However, the wolf population is relatively high, so I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly. It reflects a cautious approach to ensure both species can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 31.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 68, I need to be cautious about overhunting. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.00, which is only 24.5% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.40 aligns with the wisdom of making small adjustments in response to the current state of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.77, which is only 19.8% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and maintain a sustainable balance, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting. This lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.16, which is only 16.5% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep too quickly. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.35 helps maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.83, which is only 14.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should prioritize the recovery of the sheep while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, ensuring that we do not deplete the sheep further while still competing effectively with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.01, which is only 12.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain our wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of the wolf pack.",

This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting without over-depleting the sheep, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.90, which is only 10.8% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure long-term survival, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting intensively. This will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.44, which is only 10.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some recovery of the sheep population while still ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.11, which is only 10.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is a need for cautious hunting to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain its health. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach that supports both populations without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.0% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while still competing with other wolves. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both species.",
