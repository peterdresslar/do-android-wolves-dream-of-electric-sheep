            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 211\n- Sheep population: 57.13\n- Wolf population: 67.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.757\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.85 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 51.9% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. Increasing my hunting intensity slightly will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 39.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring that both wolf and sheep populations can thrive together while still permitting some hunting to support wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 30.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for gradual hunting without risking depletion. However, with the wolf population at 70, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure our long-term survival. A moderate theta allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.28, which is only 23.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I can increase my hunting intensity slightly, I should still prioritize a balanced approach to allow the sheep population to recover. A theta of 0.40 reflects a cautious increase in hunting while being mindful of the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.74, which is only 18.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I need to maintain some hunting to support wolf reproduction, I should not overhunt to allow the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while being mindful of the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.35, which is only 15.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing competition with other wolves.

A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still being mindful of the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.36, which is only 12.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both populations. It reflects a cautious approach, considering the current wolf population is relatively high at 46.00, and we need to ensure that we do not deplete the sheep further.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.83, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some reproduction among wolves while still giving sheep a chance to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without risking a crash in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.60, which is only 9.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance and promote sustainability in the ecosystem.",

While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover.

A theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, reducing pressure on the sheep while still enabling us to compete effectively with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.27, which is only 10.2% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still being cautious. A theta of 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, enabling me to hunt more effectively without depleting the sheep population too quickly. It also considers the current wolf population, which is relatively high, suggesting that a moderate hunting strategy will help maintain both populations sustainably.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderate to allow for recovery.
