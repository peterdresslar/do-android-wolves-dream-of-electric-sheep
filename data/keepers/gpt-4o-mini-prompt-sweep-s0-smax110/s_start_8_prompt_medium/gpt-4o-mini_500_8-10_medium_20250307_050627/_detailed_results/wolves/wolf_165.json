            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at its maximum capacity, and while I need to ensure the survival of my pack, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A moderate hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, preventing over-depletion of the sheep while still supporting the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A theta of 0.45 strikes a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can stabilize, promoting long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and while I want to ensure the wolves can reproduce, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and prevent over-depletion of the sheep, ensuring both populations can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that they can sustain a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. A moderate increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the long-term health of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 99.37, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that can support wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to maintain balance, considering the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 79.9% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 52, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 66.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. This moderate approach helps ensure long-term sustainability and avoids depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 51.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population also being relatively high, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 39.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 70, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring both populations can thrive without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover gradually.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.28, which is only 23.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that I should maintain a moderate hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while still ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.450 to 0.40 reflects a cautious approach to balance hunting and competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.74, which is only 18.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I need to maintain some hunting to support the wolf population, I should be cautious not to overhunt and risk depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that supports both populations without causing immediate harm.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.35, which is only 15.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.93, which is only 13.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting without risking the sheep"
