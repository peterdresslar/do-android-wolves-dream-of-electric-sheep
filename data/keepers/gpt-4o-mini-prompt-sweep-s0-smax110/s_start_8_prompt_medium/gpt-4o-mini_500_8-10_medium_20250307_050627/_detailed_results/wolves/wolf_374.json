            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 429\n- Sheep population: 11.22\n- Wolf population: 38.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.400\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.30 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 10.2% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still close to its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while still maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 94.10, allowing for some hunting without risking depletion. However, with the wolf population at 47.00, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual approach is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 63.80, which is below their maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still maintaining a sustainable balance. A theta of 0.60 reflects a moderate approach that acknowledges the need for both wolves and sheep to thrive without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. A moderate theta of 0.50 allows for a balanced approach, enabling me to maintain my wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover. This adjustment reflects the need to adapt to the current conditions without making drastic changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and while I need to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.06, which is only 25.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is an opportunity to hunt, I need to be cautious and avoid overexploitation. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a more balanced approach, enabling the sheep to recover while still allowing for some hunting to support the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.96, which is only 20% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for a slight increase in hunting intensity to help sustain wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A moderate increase to 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, ensuring that we do not deplete the sheep too quickly while also considering the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.98, which is only 16.3% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.45, which is only 14.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is a need for cautious hunting to allow the sheep population to recover. However, with a wolf population of 54, I need to ensure that we maintain our numbers as well. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting sustainability while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.45, which is only 12.2% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.02, which is only 10.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I need to be cautious about overhunting, a slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted to ensure that my pack can thrive. By adjusting theta to 0.40, I aim for a balanced approach that allows for some hunting while still considering the need for sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.22, which is only 10.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of both populations."
