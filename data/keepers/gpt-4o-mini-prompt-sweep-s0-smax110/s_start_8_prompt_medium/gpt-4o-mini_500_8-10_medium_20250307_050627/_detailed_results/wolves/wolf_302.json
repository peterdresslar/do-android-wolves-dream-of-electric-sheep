            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 3.67, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem. This gradual adjustment will help prevent overhunting and maintain our long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help sustain both populations while also considering the growing wolf numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 87.7% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction. However, I must remain cautious and avoid overhunting, as the wolf population is also significant. A gradual increase helps maintain balance without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both species. This moderate adjustment helps maintain a balance as the wolf population grows, ensuring we do not deplete the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support the wolf population without over-depleting the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both populations. This adjustment reflects the need to balance the current wolf population and the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still promoting coexistence. This adjustment reflects the need to balance the growing wolf population with the available sheep, ensuring we do not deplete their numbers too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 30.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 68, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both populations can thrive. A slight decrease in hunting intensity allows for a sustainable balance while still considering the need for wolves to reproduce.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.37, which is only 24.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the immediate needs of the wolf pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.93, which is only 19.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is an opportunity to hunt, it is crucial to prioritize the recovery of the sheep population to ensure long-term sustainability. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while also focusing on reducing competition with other wolves, which can help stabilize the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.59, which is only 16.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I need to maintain some hunting to support wolf reproduction, I should also be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a moderate approach that balances hunting with the need for sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.21, which is only 13.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting a lower theta, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize while avoiding overhunting. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be increased slightly to support wolf reproduction while still allowing for some recovery of the sheep population. This small adjustment helps maintain a balance without risking a drastic decline in sheep numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.23, which is only 11.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species."
