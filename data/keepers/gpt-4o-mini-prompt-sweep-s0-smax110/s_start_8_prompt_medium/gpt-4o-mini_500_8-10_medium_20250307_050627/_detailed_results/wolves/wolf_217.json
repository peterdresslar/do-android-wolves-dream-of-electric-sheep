            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring both can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.4% of its maximum capacity, allowing for some increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. However, with the wolf population at 68, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 31.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 68, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.00, which is only 24.5% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help balance the ecosystem and prevent over-depletion of sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.77, which is only 19.8% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.35 helps maintain balance and allows for sustainable coexistence."
