            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 206\n- Sheep population: 109.69\n- Wolf population: 32.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.306\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 3.43 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 99.7% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and while I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta will enable me to hunt more effectively without depleting the sheep too quickly, maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and a slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain the balance without depleting the sheep too quickly. This moderate adjustment allows for sustainable coexistence while also supporting the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 90.3% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 87.89, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we have enough prey to sustain our pack without overhunting. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover further while still supporting our wolf population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because it reflects a moderate increase in hunting intensity, allowing for a gradual response to the current sheep population, which is still below its maximum capacity. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 51.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating there is still room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 67, I need to be cautious and avoid over-hunting to ensure both populations can thrive. A slight decrease in hunting intensity allows for a more sustainable balance while still keeping an eye on the trends.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 39.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with a wolf population of 70, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting, which could lead to a decline in sheep numbers and ultimately harm both populations. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 30.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 70, I need to be cautious about overhunting. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still providing enough resources for the wolf pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.28, which is only 23.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate increase to 0.45 allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.74, which is only 18.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By lowering my hunting intensity slightly, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some sustainable hunting. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.35, which is only 15.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.93, which is only 13.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to ensure the wolf population remains healthy. A theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.36, which is only 12.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.11, which is only 11.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from the previous theta of 0.40 to 0.35, I can still focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This gradual adjustment helps maintain a balance between both populations."
