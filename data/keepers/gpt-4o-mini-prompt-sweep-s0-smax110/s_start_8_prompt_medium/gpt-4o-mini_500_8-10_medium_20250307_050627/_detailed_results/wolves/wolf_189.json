            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 79.9% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate hunting approach. This value reflects a slight reduction in hunting intensity to ensure sustainable coexistence as the wolf population is also significant. By maintaining a balanced strategy, I can support both the sheep and wolf populations without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 66.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. A moderate increase to 0.55 allows for a balanced approach that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring that the sheep population can recover and thrive. This adjustment reflects a careful response to the current conditions without risking overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the sheep population at 51.9% of its maximum capacity, I can afford to maintain a moderate hunting intensity while also considering the growing wolf population. This adjustment will help ensure sustainable coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 39.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With the wolf population at 70, a slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still providing enough sustenance for the wolves. This moderate approach helps maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep, ensuring the long-term survival of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing coexistence. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.28, which is only 23.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the wolf population is relatively high. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for more hunting to support reproduction while still being cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. This moderate adjustment helps maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep can recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.35, which is only 15.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting a lower theta, I can focus more on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.93, which is only 13.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.36, which is only 12.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.4 to 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and the wolf population is relatively high. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help sustain our population while allowing the sheep to recover gradually. This adjustment is small and aligns with the need for balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.40, which is only 10.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is potential for recovery if I reduce my hunting intensity slightly. By setting theta to 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.83, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting. This will help maintain the balance and prevent a crash in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta will help balance the need for wolf reproduction while still considering the sustainability of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.47, which is only 9.5% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable balance, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting. This lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash in both populations."
