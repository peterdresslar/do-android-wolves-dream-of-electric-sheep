            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 279\n- Sheep population: 70.32\n- Wolf population: 61.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.144\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 1.15 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 63.9% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term survival for both.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still maintaining a balance with the sheep population.",

While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, allowing for sustainable coexistence while still addressing the needs of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27, which is only 24.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 allows for a more balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still being cautious about the sheep population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.77, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there is significant competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep population to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This approach aligns with the wisdom of making gradual adjustments and focusing on long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively low at 18.16, which is only 16.5% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.35 aligns with the wisdom of making small adjustments and considering the current state of both populations.",

While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 reflects a more cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.01, which is only 12.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.68, which is only 11.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover.

This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need to compete with other wolves.",

This indicates that we need to allow the sheep to recover while also considering the growing wolf population of 32. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack without depleting the sheep further, promoting a more balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.11, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we are competing with each other for limited resources. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also reducing competition among wolves, which is crucial for our long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.01, which is only 10% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is an opportunity to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A gradual increase to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, helping to maintain both populations sustainably.",

This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach, promoting coexistence without risking a rapid depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.22, which is only 10.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I need to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must do so gradually to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach that considers both the current sheep population and the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.75, which is only 10.7% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover while still ensuring the wolf population remains stable, a lower hunting intensity is appropriate. This will help maintain a balance and prevent over-exploitation of the sheep, allowing for sustainable coexistence.",
