            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This value reflects a balanced approach, enabling sustainable coexistence while still allowing for some growth in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 56.9% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring both can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 69, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both populations can thrive. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a more balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population also being relatively high, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 29.01, which is only 26.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the competition with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.17, which is only 21.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach that supports wolf reproduction while still being mindful of the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.77, which is only 17.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack without depleting the sheep further, promoting a healthier balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.32, which is only 14.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I can increase my hunting intensity slightly to take advantage of the available prey, I must be cautious not to overhunt and jeopardize the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.17, which is only 12.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support our wolf population without depleting the sheep further, fostering a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.90, which is only 11.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without risking a rapid decline in sheep numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.78, which is only 10.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach that balances our need for sustenance with the long-term health of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.26, which is only 10.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid sudden population crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.98, which is only 10.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased slightly, it is crucial to avoid overhunting to allow the sheep population to recover. A small increase to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, focusing on sustainable coexistence while still considering the need for wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.84, which is only 9.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are struggling, and a moderate increase in hunting intensity is necessary to ensure my pack can thrive while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A theta of 0.40 allows for a slight increase in hunting without overwhelming the sheep, maintaining a balance that supports both populations."
