            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 76\n- Sheep population: 12.60\n- Wolf population: 43.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.350\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.29 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 11.5% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and while I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently healthy at 104, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, I must remain cautious and avoid drastic changes, as the wolf population is still relatively low. A moderate increase to 0.45 will help maintain a balance, allowing for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 93.96, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that can sustain both the sheep and wolf populations. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to ensure that we do not over-deplete the sheep while still allowing for some hunting to support our growth. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio of 2.00, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly. It",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, but the wolf population is also quite high. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain their numbers. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of making gradual changes to ensure sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too rapidly, ensuring long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.54, it indicates that we should be cautious about hunting too aggressively. A slight decrease in hunting intensity allows for the sheep to recover while still enabling our wolf population to thrive. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.99, which is only 26.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I can increase my hunting intensity slightly, I must do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A theta of 0.45 allows for a modest increase in hunting while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.96, which is only 20.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting to sustain the wolf population. A slight reduction from my previous theta of 0.45 will help maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.55, which is only 16.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.400 to 0.35, I can maintain a balance that focuses on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.92, which is only 14.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that I should focus on a balanced approach to allow the sheep to recover while still ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a sustainable coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.86, which is only 12.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By setting a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.60, which is only 11.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still being mindful of the need to compete with other wolves."
