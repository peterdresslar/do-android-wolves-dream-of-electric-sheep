This will help support wolf reproduction while still maintaining a balance that prevents over-depletion of the sheep. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the trends in both populations, a gradual increase in hunting intensity is appropriate to ensure long-term survival.",

This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover and maintain balance in the ecosystem. A gradual approach is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.17, which is only 21.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I can increase hunting intensity, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still giving sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.77, which is only 17.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to allow the sheep to recover, so I am opting for a lower hunting intensity. By focusing more on competing with other wolves, I can help stabilize our population while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.32, which is only 14.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I need to maintain a balance, I can afford to increase my hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A small increase to 0.40 allows for a cautious approach that considers both the current low sheep numbers and the need for wolves to thrive.",
