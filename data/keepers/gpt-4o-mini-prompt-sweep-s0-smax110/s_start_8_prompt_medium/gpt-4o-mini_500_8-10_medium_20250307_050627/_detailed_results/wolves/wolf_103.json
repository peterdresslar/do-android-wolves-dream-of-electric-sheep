            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover and prevent overexploitation. This gradual approach will help maintain a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for sheep recovery. A lower theta will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can stabilize, which is crucial for the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and a moderate increase in hunting intensity will allow for sustainable coexistence while still enabling the wolf population to thrive. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance without risking a sudden decline in sheep numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while ensuring we do not deplete their numbers too quickly. This adjustment supports our wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover and thrive. A gradual increase aligns with the wisdom of maintaining balance and adapting to the current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 70.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with a wolf population of 58, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, and while it is beneficial to increase hunting intensity slightly, I must also consider the growing wolf population. A theta of 0.40 allows for a balanced approach that supports both sheep recovery and wolf sustainability, avoiding drastic changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.71, it is important to focus on maintaining a balance that allows the sheep to recover while also ensuring the wolf population does not decline too rapidly. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will help foster a sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 37.94, which is only 34.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 29.01, which is only 26.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without risking depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach to hunting while still being mindful of the growing wolf population. This adjustment aims to maintain a healthy ecosystem and avoid sudden changes that could destabilize both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.17, which is only 21.1% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, allowing both populations to stabilize without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.77, which is only 17.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is a need to hunt for sustenance, I must also be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on the competition with other wolves, ensuring a balanced approach that promotes recovery for the sheep and stability for the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.32, which is only 14.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach that supports wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.17, which is only 12.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting a theta of 0.35, I can focus more on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This gradual adjustment helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.90, which is only 11.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly."
