            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and my previous theta was quite low. A gradual increase in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance while allowing the sheep population to recover slightly. This approach supports the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 87.7% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 46, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover and maintain balance. It",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still considering the need for balance as both populations fluctuate.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term survival of both species. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to ensure that the sheep can recover while also allowing the wolf population to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but I need to be cautious as the wolf population is also growing. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain the balance without depleting the sheep too quickly. This approach allows for gradual adjustments while ensuring both populations can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 33.91, which is only 30.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight reduction in hunting intensity allows for a more sustainable balance, enabling both sheep and wolves to recover and thrive over time.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level (24.0% of maximum capacity), which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. However, with the wolf population at 66.00, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.93, which is only 19.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring a balance that promotes the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.59, which is only 16.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a more balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the immediate needs of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.21, which is only 13.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.57, which is only 12.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach to hunting while still considering the need for competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the wolf population is relatively high. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf pack to maintain its numbers. This approach supports sustainable coexistence and avoids depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.56, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking their depletion. This adjustment aims to support the wolf population"
