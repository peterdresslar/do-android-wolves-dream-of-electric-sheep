            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while still maintaining a sustainable balance with the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 80.02, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we can afford to be cautious. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, giving sheep a chance to recover while still enabling us to compete effectively with other wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in our ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the wolf population is relatively high. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain their numbers. This approach aligns with the wisdom of making gradual adjustments to ensure long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 37.15, which is only 33.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still being mindful of the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.62, which is only 26.0% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing competition among wolves, which will help stabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.21, which is only 20.2% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking the depletion of the sheep population. A gradual increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for some growth in the wolf population while still being mindful of the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.75, which is only 16.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting approach to ensure our wolf population remains healthy. A theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without over-depleting the sheep, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.41, which is only 14.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.32, which is only 12.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need to compete with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to support our population without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.18, which is only 11.1% of its maximum capacity. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while also addressing the competition with other wolves. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both populations."
