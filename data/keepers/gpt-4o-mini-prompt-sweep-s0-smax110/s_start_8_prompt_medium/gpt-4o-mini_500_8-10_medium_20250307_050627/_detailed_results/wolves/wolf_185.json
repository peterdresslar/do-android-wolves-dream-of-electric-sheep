            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 79.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.69, it is essential to maintain a balance to ensure the long-term survival of both species. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will allow for sustainable coexistence while still supporting the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover gradually.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. While the sheep population is recovering, I want to ensure that my pack remains healthy without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight reduction from my previous theta will help maintain sustainability while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but with the wolf population also being relatively high, a moderate hunting intensity will allow for coexistence while preventing over-depletion of sheep. This approach supports both immediate needs and long-term stability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 30.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with a wolf population of 70, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is low, suggesting that if I increase hunting intensity too much, it could lead to a rapid decline in the sheep population. A slight decrease in theta to 0.40 allows for a more balanced approach, enabling both populations to stabilize while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.28, which is only 23.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I can increase my hunting intensity slightly, I must be cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate increase to 0.45 allows for a balance between hunting and ensuring the sheep can recover, while also considering the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.74, which is only 18.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.35, which is only 15.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach to hunting while still considering the need for wolf population stability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.93, which is only 13.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to ensure the wolf population remains healthy. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach that balances the need for sustenance with the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.36, which is only 12.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still being mindful of the need to adapt to changing conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.40, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking their long-term survival. This adjustment will help maintain a balance as I respond to the current conditions while still being cautious about the wolf population growth.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.83, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 will help balance the need for hunting with the necessity of sheep recovery, avoiding sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.60, which is only 9.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while also considering the need for wolves to thrive."
