            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 71\n- Sheep population: 28.99\n- Wolf population: 69.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.450\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.42 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 26.4% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A slight decrease from my previous theta will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition with other wolves. A moderate theta value will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at maximum capacity, and with a high sheep-to-wolf ratio, it is crucial to focus on competition with other wolves. This will allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a sustainable balance for our wolf pack. A lower theta will help prevent overhunting and ensure long-term survival for both species.",

Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover and ensures the long-term survival of both species. It also helps to stabilize the wolf population as we adapt to the current conditions.",

Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both populations.",

A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution in hunting to avoid depleting their numbers. A slight reduction in hunting intensity allows for some competition among wolves while still enabling the sheep to recover, promoting a sustainable balance.",

This moderate adjustment allows for sustainable coexistence while also considering the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively healthy at 104, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, given the current wolf population and the need to maintain balance, a moderate increase to 0.40 will help sustain both populations without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 93.96, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while maintaining a sustainable balance.
