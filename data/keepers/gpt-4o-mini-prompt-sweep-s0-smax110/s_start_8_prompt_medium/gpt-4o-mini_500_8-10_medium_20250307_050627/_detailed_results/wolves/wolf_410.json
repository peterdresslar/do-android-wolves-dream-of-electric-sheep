            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively low. A slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted to ensure the wolves can sustain themselves, but I must be cautious to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. This gradual adjustment allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and my previous theta was low. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity slightly while allowing the sheep to recover. This moderate approach will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in sheep numbers, jeopardizing the long-term survival of both species. Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at maximum capacity, and maintaining a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover and prevent overexploitation. This approach also helps to stabilize the wolf population as we face competition from other wolves. Gradual adjustments are key to ensuring long-term survival for both species.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery and prevent depletion. Maintaining a focus on competition with other wolves will help ensure our population remains stable while the sheep can gradually increase again.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery. With the wolf population relatively stable, maintaining a lower theta will help ensure that both populations can coexist sustainably without risking a crash.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 94.21, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to maintain balance as the wolf population is also significant at 48.00. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can promote coexistence and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
