            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that they can sustain some hunting pressure without immediate risk of depletion. However, given the current wolf population, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure our long-term survival. A moderate increase in hunting intensity allows for some reproduction while still considering the balance with the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that they can sustain a bit more hunting pressure without risking a crash. However, since the wolf population is relatively stable, I want to avoid over-hunting and ensure that both populations can thrive together. A moderate increase in hunting intensity allows for sustainable coexistence while still being mindful of the long-term health of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 104, which allows for a moderate hunting intensity. This will help maintain a balance between the wolf and sheep populations while ensuring that we do not deplete the sheep too quickly. A slight reduction from my previous theta allows for a sustainable approach as the wolf population grows.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 93.96, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity while ensuring that the sheep can recover. This value supports a sustainable balance, as it is important to avoid over-depleting the sheep while also considering the growth of the wolf population. A gradual adjustment helps maintain stability in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the sheep-to-wolf ratio at 1.43, it is wise to maintain a moderate hunting intensity to ensure both populations can thrive without depleting the sheep too quickly. This adjustment allows for sustainable coexistence while still supporting the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, but not at maximum capacity. A moderate hunting intensity allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves. This approach balances the need to maintain our population without over-depleting the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both species. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to ensure that the sheep can recover and the wolf population remains healthy.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that considers both the current sheep population and the growing wolf numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.99, which is only 26.4% of its maximum capacity. While I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. A slight decrease in theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.96, which is only 20.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I can increase my hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. A moderate increase to 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.55, which is only 16.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while also focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring a balance that supports both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.92, which is only 14.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.86, which is only 12.6% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must prioritize the recovery of the sheep. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, promoting a balance that can lead to sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.60, which is only 11.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery."
