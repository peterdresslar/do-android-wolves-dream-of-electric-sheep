            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating a need for careful management. While I want to maintain hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must also consider the risk of depleting the sheep population. A slight reduction from my previous theta allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and a slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain the balance while allowing for some reproduction among wolves. This adjustment is moderate enough to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring both populations can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a sustainable balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring both populations can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 96.23, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that can support wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This balance helps maintain the ecosystem",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 76.6% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is key to maintaining balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the sheep-to-wolf ratio at 1.15, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for some hunting without risking depletion. Given that the wolf population is also relatively high, a slight reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain balance while still allowing for some reproduction among wolves. This approach supports sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term health of both sheep and wolves. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to ensure that we do not over-deplete the sheep population as we adapt to the growing wolf numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. It",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.00, which is only 24.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing our own population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our needs without depleting the sheep further, promoting a healthier ecosystem in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.77, which is only 19.8% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking the depletion of the sheep population. A gradual increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for sustainable coexistence while still supporting the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.16, which is only 16.5% of its maximum capacity. A moderate approach will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain its health. This gradual adjustment helps ensure that both populations can thrive without leading to a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.83, which is only 14.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting sustainability while still considering the need to compete with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.01, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking over-depletion. This moderate adjustment will help sustain both the wolf and sheep populations while allowing for gradual recovery of the sheep."
