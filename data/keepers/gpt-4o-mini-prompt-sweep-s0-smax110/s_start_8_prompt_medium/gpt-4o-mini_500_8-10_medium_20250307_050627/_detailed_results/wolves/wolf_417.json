A theta of 0.45 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for some hunting while preventing over-depletion of the sheep population. This will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. With a high sheep-to-wolf ratio, focusing on competition with other wolves will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that we should be cautious in our hunting to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta reflects a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep to thrive. This adjustment allows for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. By reducing hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover and maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem. This approach also helps prevent overexploitation of the sheep, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity slightly to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. This moderate approach will help prevent over-depletion of the sheep and promote a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that they are vulnerable to overhunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach helps maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",

This approach also helps to stabilize the wolf population as we face competition from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that a slight increase in hunting intensity is appropriate to ensure the wolf population can thrive. However, I must be cautious and avoid drastic changes, as the wolf population is also relatively stable. A gradual increase allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling us to respond to the dynamics of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that they can sustain a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. A gradual increase from my previous theta allows for better adaptation to the current conditions while still considering the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 94.21, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while ensuring we do not deplete their numbers too quickly. This moderate adjustment reflects a balance between competing with other wolves and maintaining a sustainable sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity gradually, I must also consider the growing wolf population. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach that supports both sheep recovery and wolf health.",

This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to ensure that the sheep can recover and that the wolf population remains healthy without risking overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 37.15, which is only 33.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for more hunting intensity while still being cautious, as the wolf population is relatively high at 71. I aim to maintain a balance that supports both populations in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.62, which is only 26.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a focus on competition with other wolves. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.21, which is only 20.2% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still being cautious. A gradual increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for sustainable coexistence as the sheep population can recover without depleting them too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.75, which is only 16.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing our need for sustenance with the necessity of ensuring the sheep can rebound."
