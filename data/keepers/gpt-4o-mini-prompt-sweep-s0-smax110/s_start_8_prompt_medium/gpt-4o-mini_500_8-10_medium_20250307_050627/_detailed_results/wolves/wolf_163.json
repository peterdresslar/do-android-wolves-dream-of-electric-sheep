            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A gradual increase in theta is necessary to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly while still maintaining a focus on competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. With a high sheep-to-wolf ratio, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be cautiously increased to prevent over-depletion. However, given the current wolf population and the need for sustainable coexistence, a gradual increase allows for adaptation without risking a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is very close to its maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 3.43, it is essential to focus on competition among wolves to maintain a healthy balance and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring both can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 90.3% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 43, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 79.9% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly, considering the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need for gradual changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 51.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population also being relatively high, a slight reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and allow both populations to thrive without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but still below maximum capacity. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover gradually. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 33.51, which is only 30.5% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.28, which is only 23.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.74, which is only 18.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a more balanced approach, focusing on sustainable coexistence while still considering the need for wolf population health.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.35, which is only 15.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is a need for hunting to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A moderate increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.93, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to balance the needs of both wolves and sheep, ensuring sustainable coexistence while allowing for some growth in the wolf population."
