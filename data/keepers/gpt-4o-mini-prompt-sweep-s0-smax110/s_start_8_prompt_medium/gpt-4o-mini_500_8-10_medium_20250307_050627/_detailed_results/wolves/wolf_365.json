            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 427\n- Sheep population: 13.45\n- Wolf population: 48.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.400\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.28 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 12.2% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A theta of 0.45 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for some hunting while also considering the need to sustain the sheep population and avoid overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and while I want to ensure the wolves can thrive, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and prevent over-depletion of the sheep, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is close to its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports our wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover and thrive. By gradually increasing theta, I can ensure a balance that supports both species without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the sheep-to-wolf ratio being 1.43, it indicates that while there are enough sheep to support hunting, I should avoid overexploitation to ensure long-term survival. A slight reduction from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach as the wolf population grows.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 58.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population also at a similar level, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.70, it is crucial to maintain a balance that allows both populations to thrive. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help the sheep recover while still allowing for some hunting to support the wolf population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining sustainable cycles.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 36.68, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.06, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to increase. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.96, which is only 20% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still being cautious. By gradually increasing theta, I can help ensure the wolf population remains healthy without depleting the sheep too quickly, allowing for a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.98, which is only 16.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support our wolf population while also giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.45, which is only 14.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased slightly to support wolf reproduction, it is crucial to avoid overhunting to allow the sheep population to recover. A moderate increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.45, which is only 12.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly."
