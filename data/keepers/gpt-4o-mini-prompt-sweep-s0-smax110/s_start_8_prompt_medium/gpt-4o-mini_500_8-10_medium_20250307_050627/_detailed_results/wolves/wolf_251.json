            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 96.23, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction. However, I must remain cautious and avoid overhunting, as the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity. This moderate increase will help maintain a balance while ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 76.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with the wolf population at 53, I need to be cautious about overhunting. A moderate theta of 0.60 allows for continued hunting to support wolf reproduction while ensuring that the sheep population can sustain itself and recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that balances the needs of both wolves and sheep. This adjustment will help maintain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the wolf population is relatively high. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still providing enough resources for the wolves. This balance helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.65, a moderate approach allows for a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring both populations can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still considering the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.00, which is only 24.5% of its maximum capacity. While I want to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance and prevent over-depletion of the sheep, while still allowing for some hunting to support wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.77, which is only 19.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.16, which is only 16.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a sustainable hunting strategy. A moderate theta of 0.35 will help balance our competition with other wolves and ensure the sheep population can gradually increase without depleting their numbers too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.83, which is only 14.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting sustainability while still considering the need for wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.01, which is only 12.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support our wolf population, but it also prioritizes the sustainability of the sheep, ensuring that we do not deplete their numbers further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.68, which is only 11.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting without risking depletion. However, with a wolf population of 40, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the sustainability of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.90, which is only 10.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support our wolf population without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.44, which is only 10.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the immediate needs of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.11, which is only 10.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species."
