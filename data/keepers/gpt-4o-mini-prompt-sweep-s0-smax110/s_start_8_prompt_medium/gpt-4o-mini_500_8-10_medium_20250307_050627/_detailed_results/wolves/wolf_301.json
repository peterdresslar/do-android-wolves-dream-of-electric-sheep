            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A slight decrease from my previous theta will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and while there is still a healthy number of sheep available, I want to ensure that we do not overhunt and risk depleting their numbers. A slight decrease in hunting intensity allows for a sustainable balance, giving sheep a chance to recover while still supporting our wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment helps maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term survival for both.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This approach helps maintain a sustainable balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 83.59, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while ensuring sustainability. This adjustment helps maintain a balance as the wolf population is stable, and I want to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A gradual increase allows for adaptation to the current conditions without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while I want to ensure my pack thrives, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain balance as the wolf population is relatively high. This approach supports long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery. A moderate increase to 0.45 reflects a cautious approach to ensure both populations can thrive without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 39.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 68, it is wise to maintain a cautious approach to avoid over-depleting the sheep while still allowing for some hunting to support wolf reproduction. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual increase aligns with the wisdom of adapting to changing conditions.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.93, which is only 19.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some reproduction among wolves while still giving sheep a chance to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without risking a drastic decline in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.59, which is only 16.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, promoting a balance that supports both populations in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.21, which is only 13.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the immediate needs of the wolf pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.57, which is only 12.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover.
