            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 70.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, the wolf population is also significant, and I need to ensure that we do not overhunt and deplete the sheep too quickly. A moderate increase in hunting intensity allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 56.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population being slightly higher than the sheep population, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the wolf population is relatively high. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain their numbers. This balance helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 37.94, which is only 34.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 allows for a balanced approach that supports wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 29.01, which is only 26.4% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting sheep. This will allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a healthy balance in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.17, which is only 21.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room to increase hunting intensity slightly without risking immediate depletion. However, with a wolf population of 64, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A gradual increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach that supports both wolf reproduction and sheep recovery."
