            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and while I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A moderate hunting intensity will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. A moderate approach will help maintain balance while ensuring the wolf population does not grow too rapidly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 4.23, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at its maximum capacity, and while I need to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 3.55, it is crucial to focus on competition among wolves rather than depleting the sheep further. This approach will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that they can sustain a slight increase in hunting intensity without causing immediate harm. However, given the current wolf population and the need to avoid overexploitation of sheep, a gradual increase is prudent to maintain balance and ensure long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 102.53, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while maintaining a sustainable balance. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help ensure the wolf population can thrive without depleting the sheep too quickly. A gradual increase is prudent given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 70.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.34, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population also being relatively high, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 69, which is relatively high, I need to be cautious about overhunting. A moderate increase in hunting intensity allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling the sheep to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 37.94, which is only 34.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance while allowing for some growth in the wolf population as well.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 29.01, which is only 26.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing more on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.17, which is only 21.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for increased hunting intensity without risking immediate depletion. However, with the wolf population at 64, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach that supports both wolf reproduction and the recovery of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.77, which is only 17.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.32, which is only 14.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I can increase my hunting intensity slightly, I must be cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate increase to 0.40 allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery."
