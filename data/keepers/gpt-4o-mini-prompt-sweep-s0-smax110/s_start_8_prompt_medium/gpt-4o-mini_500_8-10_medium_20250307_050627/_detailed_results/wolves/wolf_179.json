            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 220\n- Sheep population: 11.40\n- Wolf population: 36.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.300\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.32 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 10.4% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still healthy at 99.37, allowing for some increased hunting intensity without risking depletion. However, I want to avoid over-hunting as the wolf population is also growing. A moderate increase to 0.75 allows for sustainable coexistence while still supporting wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still below its maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain our wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover without being overly depleted. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance and avoid sudden population crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that can support wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This approach balances the needs of both populations and avoids overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 51.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 67, which is relatively high, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A moderate theta of 0.55 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting to support wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 39.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 70, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both populations can thrive. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on the competition among wolves, promoting a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 33.51, which is only 30.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to allow for sheep recovery. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.28, which is only 23.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring both populations can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.74, which is only 18.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for more hunting intensity while still being cautious, as the wolf population is relatively high. This approach aims to balance the needs of both wolves and sheep, ensuring long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.35, which is only 15.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a focus on competition with other wolves. A theta of 0.35 strikes a balance between ensuring my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.93, which is only 13.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for sustainable cycles.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.36, which is only 12.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for sustenance with the long-term health of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain balance and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.40, which is only 10.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep further."
