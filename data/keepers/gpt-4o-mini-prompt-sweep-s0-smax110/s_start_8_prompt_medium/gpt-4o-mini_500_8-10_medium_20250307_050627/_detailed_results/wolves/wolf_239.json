            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and while I want to maintain a healthy wolf population, I also need to ensure that the sheep can recover. A moderate theta allows for sustainable hunting while preventing depletion of the sheep, balancing the needs of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is near its maximum capacity, and while it is important to maintain a healthy wolf population, I want to ensure that we do not overhunt and deplete the sheep too quickly. A slight reduction in hunting intensity allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 87.5% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate hunting approach. This will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for adaptation to the growing wolf population, ensuring sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 76.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with the wolf population at 53, it's important to avoid overhunting to ensure sustainability. A moderate increase to 0.55 allows for a balanced approach to hunting while still considering the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the sheep-to-wolf ratio at 1.15, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. This value will help maintain the sheep population while ensuring the wolf pack remains healthy. Gradually adjusting to a slightly lower hunting intensity will also allow for the recovery of both populations in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. Given the current wolf population, a slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow for better coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction. However, I must remain cautious and avoid overhunting, as the wolf population is already significant. A gradual increase will help maintain balance without risking depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.00, which is only 24.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance and ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.77, which is only 19.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.16, which is only 16.5% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.83, which is only 14.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to allow the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack without depleting the sheep further, promoting a more balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.01, which is only 12.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the long-term health of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.68, which is only 11.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our needs without depleting the sheep further, promoting a healthier balance."
