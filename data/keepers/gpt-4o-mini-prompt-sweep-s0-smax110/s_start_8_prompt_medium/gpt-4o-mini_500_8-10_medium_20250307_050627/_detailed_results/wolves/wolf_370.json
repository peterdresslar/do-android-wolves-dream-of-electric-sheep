            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 428\n- Sheep population: 12.02\n- Wolf population: 43.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.350\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.28 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 10.9% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and while I want to maintain a healthy wolf population, I also need to ensure that the sheep can recover. A moderate hunting intensity allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is close to its maximum capacity, indicating that a moderate hunting intensity is appropriate to allow for sustainable coexistence. This balance will help maintain the sheep population while also supporting the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate hunting approach. This will help sustain both the sheep and wolf populations while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep. Gradually reducing hunting intensity will also help maintain balance as the wolf population grows.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still maintaining a sustainable balance with the sheep population. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the sheep population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight reduction in hunting intensity. This will help maintain the balance between wolves and sheep, ensuring both populations can thrive without depleting resources too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 69, which is relatively high, I need to be cautious about overhunting. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain a healthy population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and while it is important to maintain a healthy wolf population, I need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to stabilize and grow, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.06, which is only 25.5% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A moderate adjustment helps maintain balance and supports both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.96, which is only 20% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance and prevent over-depletion of the sheep, while still allowing for some hunting to support wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.98, which is only 16.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population and maintaining a balance with the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.45, which is only 14.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should be cautious with our hunting to allow the sheep to recover. However, with a moderate wolf population of 54, a slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted to ensure our pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.45, which is only 12.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still enabling some hunting to support our population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.02, which is only 10.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves and allow the sheep population to stabilize, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem."
