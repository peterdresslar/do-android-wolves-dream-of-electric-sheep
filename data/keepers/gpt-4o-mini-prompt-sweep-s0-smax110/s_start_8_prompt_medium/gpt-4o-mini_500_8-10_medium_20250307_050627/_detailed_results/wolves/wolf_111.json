            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a moderate hunting approach that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This small adjustment from my previous theta reflects a cautious strategy, balancing the need for sustenance with the importance of maintaining a healthy ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 84% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate hunting approach. This will help maintain a balance between my pack's needs and the sheep's recovery, ensuring long-term survival for both species. A slight decrease from my previous theta will also account for the growing wolf population, preventing overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction. However, I must remain cautious and avoid overhunting, as the wolf population is also significant. This moderate adjustment helps maintain balance and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 56.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population being slightly higher than the sheep population, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to prevent a crash in the sheep population. A moderate adjustment to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach that supports both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring sustainability while still allowing for some growth in the wolf pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 37.94, which is only 34.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing our own population. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity and promote a sustainable balance, ensuring both wolves and sheep can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 29.01, which is only 26.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I need to maintain a focus on hunting to ensure the wolf population thrives, I should do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.17, which is only 21.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is potential for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for more hunting intensity while still being cautious, as the wolf population is relatively high at 64.00. This approach aims to balance the needs of both species and promote long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.77, which is only 17.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a lower hunting intensity is necessary to allow the sheep to recover. Additionally, with a wolf population of 59, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.32, which is only 14.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still being mindful of the need to compete with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.17, which is only 12.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support our wolf population without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.90, which is only 11.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain our wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the immediate needs of the pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.78, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance while still being cautious about the low sheep numbers."
