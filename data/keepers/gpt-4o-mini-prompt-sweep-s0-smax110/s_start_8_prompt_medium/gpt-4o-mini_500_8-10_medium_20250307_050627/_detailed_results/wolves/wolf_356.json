            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and hunting them aggressively could lead to depletion. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a stable wolf population. This gradual adjustment will help ensure long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery. Maintaining a lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, preventing overhunting and potential crashes in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to depletion of their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover while keeping the wolf population stable. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery. Maintaining a balance is crucial to ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, especially as the wolf population is relatively stable. Gradual adjustments are key, and at this moment, focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting is the best strategy.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that we should be cautious with our hunting to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance while still considering the need for wolf population sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. With a high sheep-to-wolf ratio and a growing wolf population, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must also ensure that the sheep have the opportunity to recover. A small increase to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach that considers both the current high sheep population and the need to avoid overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is close to its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still considering the long-term sustainability of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 85.5% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 47, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still ensuring that the sheep population can recover and maintain balance. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio, a gradual increase is prudent to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 58.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population being equal to the sheep population, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.70, it is important to maintain a balance that allows both populations to thrive. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help ensure the sheep can recover while also allowing the wolf population to stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 36.68, which is only 33.3% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A moderate adjustment helps maintain balance and allows for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.06, which is only 25.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is some opportunity for hunting, it is important to maintain a balance to allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help ensure the long-term survival of both species while avoiding over-depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.96, which is only 20.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a slight increase in hunting compared to my previous value, but still prioritizes the sustainability of both populations by avoiding overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.98, which is only 16.3% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance as the sheep population recovers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.45, which is only 14.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting without over-depleting the sheep, ensuring a sustainable balance as we adapt to the current conditions."
