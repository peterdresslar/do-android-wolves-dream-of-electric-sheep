            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and hunting them aggressively could lead to depletion. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover and ensures the long-term survival of both species. It also helps to stabilize the wolf population as we adapt to the current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover and prevents overexploitation. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and while I want to increase hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that promotes coexistence while still acknowledging the need for wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high at 104, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population also being significant, I want to ensure we don",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 93.96, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still ensuring the sheep can recover. This adjustment reflects a balanced approach to maintain both wolf and sheep populations sustainably.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while I want to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I also recognize the need to allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain balance without risking over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment reflects a balance between ensuring the wolf population can thrive while still allowing sheep to recover and maintain their numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for some hunting without risking depletion. Given the wolf population is relatively high, a slight reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and allow sheep to recover while still supporting wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can still recover. A gradual approach is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.99, which is only 26.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight reduction from my previous theta allows for a focus on competition with other wolves, which can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.96, which is only 20.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 balances our need to hunt with the necessity of ensuring the sheep population can rebound, preventing future crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.55, which is only 16.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for gradual adjustments.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.92, which is only 14.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover rather than intensifying our hunting. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for some hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.86, which is only 12.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain our wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of the wolf pack."
