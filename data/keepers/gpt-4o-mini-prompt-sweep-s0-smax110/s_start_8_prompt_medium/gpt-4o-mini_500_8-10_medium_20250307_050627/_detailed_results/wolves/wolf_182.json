            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 221\n- Sheep population: 10.83\n- Wolf population: 32.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.400\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.34 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 9.8% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 90.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep. However, my previous theta was very low at 0.025, which suggests a need to gradually increase hunting intensity to ensure the wolf population can thrive. A theta of 0.3 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting to support wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 79.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.69, it is essential to maintain a balance to avoid overhunting. A moderate increase to 0.40 allows for some hunting intensity while still considering the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover gradually.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 51.9% of its maximum capacity, allowing for some hunting without risking depletion. However, with the wolf population at 67, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep do not become too depleted. A gradual increase is wise, as it aligns with the current trends and avoids sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 30.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 70, I need to be cautious and avoid over-hunting to ensure both populations can thrive. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain their numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.28, which is only 23.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A moderate increase from my previous theta of 0.400 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.74, which is only 18.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing our wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.35, which is only 15.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.93, which is only 13.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from the previous theta of 0.40 to 0.35, I can still maintain a balance that allows for some hunting while prioritizing the long-term survival of both species. This gradual adjustment helps avoid sudden population crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.36, which is only 12.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the long-term health of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.40, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. A moderate increase to 0.40 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.83, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for sustenance with the long-term health of both species."
