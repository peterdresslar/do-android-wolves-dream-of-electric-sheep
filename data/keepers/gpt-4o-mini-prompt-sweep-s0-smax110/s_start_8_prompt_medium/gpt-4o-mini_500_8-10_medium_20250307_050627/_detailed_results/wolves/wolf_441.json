            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still quite healthy at 95.1% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain our wolf population while ensuring that the sheep do not become over-depleted. A gradual increase is necessary to avoid sudden crashes in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 94.21, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain our wolf population while ensuring that the sheep do not deplete too quickly. A gradual adjustment is key to maintaining balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep do not become overhunted. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance and avoid drastic fluctuations in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the sheep-to-wolf ratio being close to 1, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 70, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both species can thrive. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition among wolves, promoting a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A slight decrease from my previous theta will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can stabilize, promoting long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 26.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 70, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to prevent a crash in the sheep population. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for more hunting while still maintaining a balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.21, which is only 20.2% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.75, which is only 16.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for hunting with the necessity of ensuring the sheep population can grow, while also considering the current wolf population of 60. This adjustment aims to prevent overexploitation and promote sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.41, which is only 14.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.32, which is only 12.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.4 to 0.35, I can maintain a focus on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.18, which is only 11.1% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity and give the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, thus promoting a sustainable balance."
