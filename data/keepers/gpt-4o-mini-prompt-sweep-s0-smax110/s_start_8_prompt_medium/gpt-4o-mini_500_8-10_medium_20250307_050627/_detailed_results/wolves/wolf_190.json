            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 87.89, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain our wolf population while ensuring that the sheep do not deplete too quickly. A gradual adjustment is necessary to maintain balance, considering the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the overall ecosystem health.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 66.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with a wolf population of 60, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 51.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 67, which is relatively high, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A moderate theta of 0.55 allows for a balanced approach that supports both sheep recovery and wolf population stability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 39.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 70, it is wise to avoid overhunting to prevent a crash in sheep numbers. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, ensuring both populations can thrive without depleting resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 33.51, which is only 30.5% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, allowing both populations to stabilize without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.28, which is only 23.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for increased hunting intensity without risking immediate depletion of the sheep. However, since the wolf population is relatively high at 67, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight increase to 0.45 allows for a balanced approach that supports both wolf reproduction and sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.74, which is only 18.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is an opportunity to hunt, I should prioritize the recovery of the sheep population to ensure long-term sustainability. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while also focusing on reducing competition with other wolves, promoting a healthier ecosystem overall.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.35, which is only 15.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach that considers both the current low sheep population and the need for wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.93, which is only 13.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that the sheep need some time to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring that both populations can stabilize and thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.36, which is only 12.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without risking the depletion of the sheep. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach to hunting while still being mindful of the wolf population, which is currently at 46. This adjustment aims to promote coexistence and prevent drastic changes in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.11, which is only 11.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 reflects a slight increase in hunting compared to my previous value, acknowledging the need to balance our population dynamics without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.40, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there is a need for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction. However, I must be cautious and avoid overhunting, as the sheep population is still recovering. A gradual increase allows for a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.83, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support reproduction, but it remains low enough to avoid depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.60, which is only 9.6% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to help sustain wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.47, which is only 9.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a moderate approach that balances the need for wolves to compete with each other while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring the long-term survival of both species."
