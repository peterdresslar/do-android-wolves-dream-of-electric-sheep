            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A theta of 0.4 strikes a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population does not decline too rapidly, promoting long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain balance and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at its maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover and ensures that our wolf population can thrive in the long term without depleting our primary food source.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be increased slightly to prevent overpopulation of sheep while still being cautious. This moderate increase allows for sustainable coexistence, balancing the needs of both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and a slight increase in hunting intensity will allow for some population control while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment is small enough to avoid sudden impacts on the ecosystem, allowing both wolves and sheep to thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that they can sustain a bit more hunting without risking depletion. However, with the wolf population also being relatively stable, a moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain balance while allowing for some recovery in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 99.37, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to maintain balance, considering the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need to avoid overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 79.9% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 52, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 66.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 60, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 39.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 70, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population also being relatively high, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A gradual increase to 0.45 allows for better balance while still considering the long-term health of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.28, which is only 23.9% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.450 to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for some hunting while still prioritizing the sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.74, which is only 18.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain its health. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 will help balance hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.35, which is only 15.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still being cautious about the sheep population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.93, which is only 13.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is a need to allow the sheep to recover, so I will focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting. A gradual decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance and support the long-term survival of both populations."
