            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at maximum capacity, indicating that they can sustain some hunting pressure without immediate risk of depletion. However, given the relatively high wolf population, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure our long-term survival. A slight reduction from my previous theta allows for continued hunting while promoting a balance that supports both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at its maximum capacity, and while I need to maintain a healthy wolf population, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A moderate hunting intensity will help sustain both populations without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that a more moderate hunting approach is necessary to prevent depletion. By maintaining a balance, I can ensure the sustainability of both the sheep and the wolf population, allowing for gradual adjustments as conditions change.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and while it is important to maintain a healthy wolf population, I want to ensure that the sheep can recover and thrive. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow for a more sustainable balance, preventing over-depletion of the sheep while still allowing for some hunting to support wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 96.23, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 45.00, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 76.6% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep. This moderate adjustment will help maintain the wolf population without over-depleting the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover gradually.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 51.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 66, which is relatively high, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight decrease in theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring that both populations can thrive without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still being cautious. This adjustment reflects a balance between ensuring the wolf population remains healthy and allowing the sheep to recover, considering the current trends in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 31.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 68, which is relatively high, I need to be cautious about overhunting. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain a healthy population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.00, which is only 24.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need to adapt to the current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.77, which is only 19.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.450 to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, focusing on sustainable coexistence while still considering the need for wolf population health.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.16, which is only 16.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 allows for a gradual approach to balance both populations without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.83, which is only 14.4% of its maximum capacity.
