            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 220\n- Sheep population: 11.40\n- Wolf population: 36.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.350\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.32 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 10.4% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 99.37, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking over-depletion. This value supports the growth of the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and maintain a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 79.9% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while still ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is key to maintaining balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 66.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.22, it is important to maintain a balance to prevent overhunting. A slight reduction from my previous theta allows for sustainable hunting while also considering the growth of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 51.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 67, which is relatively high, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting to support wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 39.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.63, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment reflects a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. It is essential to remain cautious and avoid drastic changes, as the wolf population is also significant.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.28, which is only 23.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should maintain a moderate hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while also ensuring that our wolf population remains healthy. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.450 will help us adapt to the current conditions without overexploiting the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.74, which is only 18.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is room for some hunting, a lower intensity will allow the sheep to recover and maintain a sustainable balance. Additionally, with the wolf population at 62.00, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.93, which is only 13.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate increase to 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.36, which is only 12.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need to adapt to the changing conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.11, which is only 11.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.40, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking their long-term survival. A moderate increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for some reproduction among wolves while still being mindful of the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.83, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 reflects a slight increase in hunting compared to my previous value, acknowledging the need for sustenance while prioritizing the long-term health of both populations."
