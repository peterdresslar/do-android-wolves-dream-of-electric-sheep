            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that we should moderate our hunting intensity to prevent depletion of their numbers. A theta of 0.6 allows for some hunting to support our population while still giving sheep a chance to recover and maintain balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A value of 0.45 reflects a balanced approach, enabling sustainable coexistence while still allowing for some hunting to support the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. A lower theta will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can stabilize, which is crucial for the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 3.79, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that considers both the current sheep population and the need to maintain a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still considering the need for sustainable coexistence.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 84.31, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a sustainable coexistence as the sheep population is at 76.6% of its maximum capacity, and it allows for some recovery of the wolf population as well.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. It is important to remain cautious and avoid drastic changes, ensuring the long-term survival of both populations.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.00, which is only 24.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance and prevent over-exploitation of the sheep, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.77, which is only 19.8% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking the depletion of the sheep population. A gradual increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, enabling sustainable coexistence while still allowing for some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.16, which is only 16.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep further, as we need to ensure long-term survival for both species.",

This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further.
