            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity while ensuring that the sheep can recover. This approach balances the need for wolf reproduction with the sustainability of the sheep population, avoiding drastic changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment reflects a balance between ensuring the wolf population remains healthy while allowing the sheep to recover and thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 50.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 66.00, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 30.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for gradual hunting without risking depletion. With the wolf population at 68, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.37, which is only 24.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.93, which is only 19.0% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, it is crucial to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of both populations. This gradual adjustment will help maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.59, which is only 16.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting sustainability without risking a rapid depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.21, which is only 13.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.4 to 0.35, I can still maintain some hunting activity while prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both populations. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.57, which is only 12.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some recovery of the sheep while still ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without risking a rapid depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.23, which is only 11.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A slight decrease from my previous theta will help balance our needs with the sustainability of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.56, which is only 10.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some replenishment of the sheep while also considering the growing wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach that supports both my pack",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.83, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure their long-term survival, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting. This lower theta will help balance the ecosystem while gradually allowing the sheep population to increase."
