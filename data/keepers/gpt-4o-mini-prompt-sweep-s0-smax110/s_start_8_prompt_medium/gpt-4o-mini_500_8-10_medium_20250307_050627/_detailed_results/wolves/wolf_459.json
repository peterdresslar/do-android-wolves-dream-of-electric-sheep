            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain our wolf population while still giving the sheep a chance to recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 70, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and while it is important to maintain a healthy wolf population, I need to ensure that the sheep can recover. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while also focusing on competition with other wolves, which is necessary given the current wolf population size. This approach promotes sustainability and prevents depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both sheep and wolves while still maintaining a focus on competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.21, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.75, which is only 16.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.41, which is only 14.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain my pack without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the long-term health of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.32, which is only 12.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking a rapid depletion of the sheep, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I need to maintain a balance, a slight increase in hunting intensity will help support the wolf population without depleting the sheep too rapidly.
