            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 94.21, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, but I want to ensure that we do not overhunt them. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a more cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still enabling some hunting to maintain our population. This balance will help sustain both species in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still ensuring their recovery. This adjustment reflects the need to balance the growing wolf population with the available sheep, promoting coexistence without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 70, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to prevent a crash in the sheep population. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow for a balance that supports both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 37.15, which is only 33.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.4 to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without over-depleting the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.62, which is only 26.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for sustainable cycles.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.21, which is only 20.2% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A moderate increase from my previous theta of 0.400 helps maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.75, which is only 16.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep population while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our own health. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, ensuring that we do not deplete the sheep further while still competing effectively with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.41, which is only 14.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.32, which is only 12.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.4 to 0.35, I can still maintain some hunting intensity while prioritizing the long-term balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.18, which is only 11.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover rather than intensifying hunting. A lower theta will help balance the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to increase, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species."
