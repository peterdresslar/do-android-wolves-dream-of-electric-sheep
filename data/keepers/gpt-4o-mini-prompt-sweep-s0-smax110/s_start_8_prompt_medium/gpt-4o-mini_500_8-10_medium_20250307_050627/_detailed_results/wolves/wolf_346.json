This moderate adjustment will help maintain balance as the sheep recover and the wolf population stabilizes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual increase aligns with the current trends and avoids sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69.00, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 33.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 70, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both populations can thrive. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on maintaining balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.06, which is only 25.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is some opportunity for hunting, I need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep population to ensure long-term sustainability. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while also focusing on competition with other wolves, which can help balance the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.96, which is only 20% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to allow for some reproduction among wolves while still giving sheep a chance to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, ensuring that both populations can thrive without depleting the sheep too quickly."
