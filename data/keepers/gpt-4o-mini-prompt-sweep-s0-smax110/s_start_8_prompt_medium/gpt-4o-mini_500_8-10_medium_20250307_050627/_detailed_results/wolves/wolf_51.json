            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 66\n- Sheep population: 93.96\n- Wolf population: 47.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.226\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 2.00 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 85.4% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for some hunting without risking depletion. However, with the wolf population also being relatively stable, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual approach is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly, and this theta reflects a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, but the wolf population is also quite high. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still supporting the wolf population. This moderate approach helps maintain balance and avoids depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term health of both populations. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to ensure that the sheep can recover while also allowing the wolf population to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.99, which is only 26.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 allows for more hunting to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious to avoid overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.96, which is only 20.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should maintain a moderate hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while still ensuring our wolf population remains healthy. A slight decrease from my previous theta of 0.45 will help balance our needs without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.55, which is only 16.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.40 to 0.35, I can maintain a focus on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.92, which is only 14.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done gradually to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase to 0.40 allows for some hunting while still considering the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.86, which is only 12.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing more on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.60, which is only 11.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need to adapt as the populations change.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.53, which is only 10.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for wolves to compete with each other while still allowing for some hunting to support reproduction. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.96, which is only 10.0% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still being cautious. By raising theta to 0.40, I can begin to take advantage of the sheep population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.55, which is only 9.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to stabilize while still competing with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem."
