            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the balance between wolves and sheep. This value reflects a cautious approach, allowing for some hunting without risking the depletion of the sheep population, which is crucial for our long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 72.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.40, it is important to maintain a balance that allows for both wolf and sheep populations to thrive. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from the previous theta of 0.25 to 0.35, I can support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover and avoid over-depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain the wolf population while still allowing sheep to recover. A gradual increase is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and while it is important to maintain a healthy wolf population, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease from my previous theta will help balance the competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to increase their numbers. This approach aligns with the wisdom of making gradual adjustments to ensure long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.62, which is only 26.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done gradually to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the sustainability of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.21, which is only 20.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight decrease from my previous theta of 0.45 allows for a more cautious approach, balancing the need for hunting with the necessity of allowing the sheep population to recover. This adjustment also considers the growing wolf population, ensuring that we do not overhunt and create a cycle of scarcity.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.75, which is only 16.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate increase to 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population and maintaining a balance with the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.41, which is only 14.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase to 0.40 allows for more hunting while still considering the long-term sustainability of both populations.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.18, which is only 11.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and gradually increase. This approach aligns with the wisdom of making small adjustments and ensuring long-term survival for both species."
