            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 37.15, which is only 33.8% of its maximum capacity. Given the relatively high wolf population of 71, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting, ensuring both species can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.62, which is only 26.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is an opportunity to hunt, I need to be cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate increase from my previous theta of 0.25 allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I need to increase my hunting intensity to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.75, which is only 16.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it is crucial to do so gradually to avoid depleting the sheep further. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus on maintaining a balance that allows for some hunting while also considering the need for sheep recovery and the long-term survival of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.41, which is only 14.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is potential for recovery in the sheep population. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly to 0.40, I can help maintain a balance that allows for sustainable coexistence while still ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of adapting to changing conditions without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.32, which is only 12.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By adopting a slightly lower theta, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of ensuring sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.18, which is only 11.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. Additionally, with a wolf population of 43, maintaining a lower theta will help prevent overcompetition among wolves while still allowing for some hunting."
