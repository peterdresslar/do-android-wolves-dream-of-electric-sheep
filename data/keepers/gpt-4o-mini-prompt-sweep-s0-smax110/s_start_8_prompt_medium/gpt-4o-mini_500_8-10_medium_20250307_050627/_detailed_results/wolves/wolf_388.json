            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 80.31, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that we do not deplete the sheep too quickly. A gradual adjustment is key to maintaining balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 36.68, which is only 33.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should maintain a moderate hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while still ensuring our wolf population remains healthy. A slight reduction from my previous theta of 0.50 will help balance our needs with the sustainability of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.06, which is only 25.5% of its maximum capacity. While I want to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I need to be cautious about depleting the sheep further. A slight decrease in hunting intensity allows for some recovery in the sheep population while still enabling the wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance while still considering the need for wolf population sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.98, which is only 16.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly, considering the current dynamics.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.45, which is only 14.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, ensuring that we do not deplete the sheep further while still competing effectively with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.45, which is only 12.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting without risking depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach to hunting while still considering the need to compete with other wolves, as the wolf population is relatively high. This adjustment aims to promote sustainability in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.02, which is only 10.9% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing competition with other wolves, which is necessary given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.28.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.22, which is only 10.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should be cautious with our hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for some hunting while still prioritizing the sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.64, which is only 9.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for wolf survival with the necessity of not depleting the sheep population further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.33, which is only 9.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach to hunting while still being cautious about the wolf population growth.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.16, which is only 9.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.19, which is only 9.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover.
