            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 429\n- Sheep population: 11.22\n- Wolf population: 38.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.400\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.30 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 10.2% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This balance will help sustain both the wolf and sheep populations while adapting to the current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 85.5% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that can support wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep do not deplete too quickly. This approach balances the needs of both populations and aligns with the wisdom of making gradual adjustments.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the sheep population at 63.80 and the wolf population at 64.00, maintaining a moderate theta will help ensure that both populations can thrive without depleting the sheep too quickly. This adjustment allows for gradual hunting while still considering the need for competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 69.00, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 36.68, which is only 33.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I can increase hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I need to be cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight decrease in theta allows for a more balanced approach, ensuring that both populations can recover and thrive together.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.06, which is only 25.5% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A moderate increase from my previous theta of 0.400 will help maintain balance as I monitor both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.96, which is only 20% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.35, I can focus more on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively low at 17.98, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking over-depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.45, which is only 14.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should be cautious with our hunting to allow the sheep to recover. However, with a moderate wolf population of 54, a slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted to ensure our pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.45, which is only 12.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to allow the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack without depleting the sheep further, promoting a more balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.02, which is only 10.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting without risking immediate depletion. By increasing theta slightly from 0.35 to 0.40, I can enhance hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. This small adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.22, which is only 10.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need to compete with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to sustain our population."
