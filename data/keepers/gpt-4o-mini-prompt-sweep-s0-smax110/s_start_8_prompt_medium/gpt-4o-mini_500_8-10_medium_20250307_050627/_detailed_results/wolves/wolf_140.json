Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.96, a moderate approach will help maintain balance while allowing both populations to thrive. This adjustment also considers the recent growth in wolf numbers, which suggests a need to stabilize our population by focusing on competition rather than aggressive hunting.",

However, with the wolf population at 69, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both populations can thrive. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that supports both reproduction and the recovery of sheep.",

This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.40 allows for some hunting to support our wolf population without depleting the sheep further, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.17, which is only 21.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for increased hunting intensity without risking immediate depletion of the sheep. However, with the wolf population at 64, it",
