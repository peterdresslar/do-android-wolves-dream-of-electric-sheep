Maintaining a lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, preventing overhunting and promoting a sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be increased slightly to prevent overpopulation and ensure a sustainable balance. However, since the wolf population is also growing, I must be cautious and avoid drastic changes. A small increase to 0.35 allows for a gradual adjustment while still prioritizing the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 3.55, it is crucial to focus on competition among wolves rather than depleting the sheep further. This approach will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and while I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta will enable me to hunt more effectively without depleting the sheep too quickly, maintaining a balance that supports both populations.",

This adjustment reflects a moderate approach that balances our need for sustenance with the health of the sheep population, promoting coexistence.",

This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sustainable coexistence. The sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are enough sheep to support a slight increase in hunting without risking depletion.",

However, with the wolf population at 69, which is relatively high, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting.

This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly, considering the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need for gradual changes.",

This suggests that we should prioritize the recovery of the sheep population while still allowing for some hunting to sustain our own numbers.
