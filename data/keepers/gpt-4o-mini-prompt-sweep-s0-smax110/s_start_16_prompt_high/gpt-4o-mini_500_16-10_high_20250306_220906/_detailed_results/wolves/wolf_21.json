This value balances the need to sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. It reflects a cautious approach, allowing for gradual adjustments based on the current state of both populations.",

A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling us to maintain our numbers. This approach supports a sustainable balance without risking over-depletion of the sheep.",
