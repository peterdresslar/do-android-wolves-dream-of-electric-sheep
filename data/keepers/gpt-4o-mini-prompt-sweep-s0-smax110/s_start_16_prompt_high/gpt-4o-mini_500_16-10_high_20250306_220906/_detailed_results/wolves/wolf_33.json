            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy, but the wolf population is moderately high. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for continued hunting while also giving the sheep a chance to recover and maintain balance in the ecosystem. This adjustment reflects the need to adapt to the changing sheep-to-wolf ratio.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 60.03, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population being moderately high and the sheep-to-wolf ratio becoming less favorable, a slight reduction in hunting intensity is necessary to ensure sustainable coexistence and prevent over-depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual approach is essential to avoid destabilizing the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the wolf population also being moderately high, a slight reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain the delicate balance between our populations while still allowing for some reproduction among wolves. This adjustment will help prevent over-depletion of the sheep and promote sustainable coexistence.",
