            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, so I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A moderate increase to 0.45 allows for some growth in the wolf population while still considering the long-term health of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to thrive. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 39.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. However, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, suggesting that I should focus on competition with other wolves to ensure our population remains stable while allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, suggesting that I should be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively low compared to the maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain its health. This approach aligns with the wisdom of making gradual adjustments to ensure long-term sustainability."
