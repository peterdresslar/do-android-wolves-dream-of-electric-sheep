            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 46\n- Sheep population: 39.95\n- Wolf population: 24.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.400\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 1.66 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 36.3% of maximum capacity\n\nEcosystem observations:\n- The ratio of sheep to wolves is becoming less favorable, which may require adaptation.\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3. Adjust your hunting intensity gradually in response to population changes\n4. Find a balance that creates sustainable cycles rather than crashes\n5.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful at 68.94, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.755 to 0.65 reflects a balanced approach, ensuring we do not deplete the sheep too quickly while still supporting our pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful at 70.26, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. Maintaining a moderate theta of 0.60 helps ensure that I can sustain my wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover and thrive. This gradual adjustment reflects the need to adapt to the current conditions without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently plentiful, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity while still ensuring sustainable coexistence. This adjustment reflects a balance between maintaining our wolf population and allowing the sheep to recover, as we are at a healthy sheep-to-wolf ratio.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful at 71.15, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still maintaining a sustainable balance with the sheep population, as they are not yet at maximum capacity.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful at 70.21, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This value balances the need to sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment helps maintain stability in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the sheep-to-wolf ratio becoming less favorable, a moderate theta will help maintain a sustainable coexistence while still allowing for some hunting to support wolf reproduction. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of adapting to changing conditions without risking overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy, but the wolf population is moderately high. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling us to maintain our numbers. This approach supports sustainable coexistence and avoids overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A lower theta will allow me to focus more on competing with other wolves, which will help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the wolf population is moderately high. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain our population while allowing the sheep to recover. This adjustment is gradual, ensuring we avoid over-depletion of the sheep and maintain a balance.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking over-depletion. This adjustment reflects the need to balance the growing wolf population while still ensuring the sheep can recover and thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. By focusing on competition with other wolves at a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while ensuring the long-term survival of both species. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A moderate increase in hunting intensity allows for a balance that can support both populations without depleting the sheep too quickly.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 36.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, suggesting that a more cautious approach is needed to allow sheep to recover while also considering the competition among wolves. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and ensure the long-term survival of both populations."
