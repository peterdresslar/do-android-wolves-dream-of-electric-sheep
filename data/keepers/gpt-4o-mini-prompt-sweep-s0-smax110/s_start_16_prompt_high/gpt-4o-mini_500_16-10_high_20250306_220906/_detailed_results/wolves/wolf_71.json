A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to thrive. This approach maintains a balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",

A theta of 0.50 allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some hunting to support the wolf population.",
