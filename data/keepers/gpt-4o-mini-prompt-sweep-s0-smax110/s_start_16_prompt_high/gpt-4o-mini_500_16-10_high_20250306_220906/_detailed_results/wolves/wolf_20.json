            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A lower theta will allow for more competition among wolves, which can help stabilize our numbers while giving the sheep population a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
