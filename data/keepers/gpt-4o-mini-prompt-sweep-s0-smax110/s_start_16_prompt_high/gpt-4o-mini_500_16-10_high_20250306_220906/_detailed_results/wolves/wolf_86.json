            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, and the wolf population is relatively high. A theta of 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, enabling some hunting to support wolf reproduction while also giving sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment helps maintain a sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for some hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. The wolf population is also moderately high, so a slight reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and allow both populations to thrive. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of making gradual changes in response to the current ecosystem state.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight decrease in hunting intensity allows for competition among wolves while giving the sheep population a chance to recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
