Given the moderately high wolf population and the less favorable sheep-to-wolf ratio, a gradual increase to 0.35 will help maintain balance without risking depletion of the sheep.",

However, with the wolf population being moderately high and the sheep-to-wolf ratio becoming less favorable, a gradual adjustment is necessary to avoid over-depleting the sheep. This theta allows for sustainable coexistence while still addressing the needs of the wolf pack.",
