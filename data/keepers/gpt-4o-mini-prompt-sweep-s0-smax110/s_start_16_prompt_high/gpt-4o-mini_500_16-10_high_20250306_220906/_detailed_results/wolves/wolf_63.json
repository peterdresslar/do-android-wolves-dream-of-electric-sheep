            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still recovering, and while it is important to maintain a healthy wolf population, the current sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we need to be cautious about overhunting. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to stabilize while still supporting our pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. Given the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, a slight decrease in hunting intensity will help sustain both populations while still allowing for some reproduction among wolves. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that while I need to maintain some hunting to support wolf reproduction, I must also focus on competition with other wolves to ensure our population remains stable. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while still providing enough resources for my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while still maintaining enough pressure to ensure our survival. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of adapting to changing conditions without causing sudden shifts in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly, considering the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable.",
