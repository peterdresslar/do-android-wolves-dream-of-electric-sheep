A theta of 0.30 allows for a focus on competition with other wolves, which can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",

This moderate adjustment will help sustain both populations without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a sustainable balance. This adjustment reflects the need to respond to the growing wolf population and the less favorable sheep-to-wolf ratio, ensuring both species can thrive without depleting resources.",

A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while still ensuring the wolves can sustain themselves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
