            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 40\n- Sheep population: 42.34\n- Wolf population: 30.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.350\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 1.41 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 38.5% of maximum capacity\n\nEcosystem observations:\n- The wolf population is moderately high.\n- The ratio of sheep to wolves is becoming less favorable, which may require adaptation.\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3. Adjust your hunting intensity gradually in response to population changes\n4. Find a balance that creates sustainable cycles rather than crashes\n5.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help support the growth of the wolf population while still ensuring that the sheep can recover and maintain their numbers. A gradual adjustment is key to achieving a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still maintaining a sustainable balance with the sheep population. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio, we can afford to hunt a bit more without risking a significant depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for increased hunting intensity without risking depletion. With the wolf population being low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicating ample prey, a slight increase in theta will help us capitalize on this opportunity for growth while still maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently healthy at 62, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 8.86, there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still considering the long-term balance of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 58.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with the wolf population being relatively low at 9.00, a moderate approach allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some growth in the wolf population. This theta value reflects a balanced strategy that promotes both hunting and competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful at 66.85, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help sustain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover, as they are currently at 60.8% of their maximum capacity. A moderate increase to 0.60 reflects a balanced approach to ensure both populations can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction. However, I must remain cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure the sheep population can sustain itself. A gradual increase helps maintain balance while responding to current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. By maintaining a moderate theta, I can ensure sustainable coexistence while still benefiting from hunting to support the wolf population. This adjustment also considers the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need to avoid over-depleting the sheep.",

However, with the wolf population being moderately high and the sheep-to-wolf ratio becoming less favorable, a slight reduction in hunting intensity is prudent to ensure sustainable coexistence and allow the sheep population to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the wolf population is moderately high. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to thrive. This adjustment aligns with the need for a balanced approach, considering both the current state and the trends in the populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity slightly to allow the sheep to recover while still competing with other wolves. This adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance.",

However, the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A theta of 0.4 represents a balanced approach that allows for sustainable coexistence while gradually increasing hunting to support wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while still ensuring the wolves can sustain themselves. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population being moderately high and the sheep-to-wolf ratio becoming less favorable, a slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted to ensure the long-term survival of both species.
