However, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, so a moderate increase in hunting will help sustain our population while still allowing sheep to recover.",

This adjustment will help maintain our wolf population while still ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual approach is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly, especially as the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, but the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain our wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover slightly, ensuring a sustainable balance.",

A moderate hunting intensity allows for a sustainable balance while also considering the potential for future wolf population growth. This adjustment helps ensure that we do not deplete the sheep too quickly, allowing both populations to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 54.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the sheep-to-wolf ratio becoming less favorable, it is wise to slightly reduce hunting intensity to allow for the recovery of sheep and maintain a balance in the ecosystem. This gradual adjustment will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 53.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. However, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, suggesting that I should focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while also considering the competition among wolves. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach that supports both populations.",

A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain their numbers. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of gradual changes to ensure long-term sustainability.",
