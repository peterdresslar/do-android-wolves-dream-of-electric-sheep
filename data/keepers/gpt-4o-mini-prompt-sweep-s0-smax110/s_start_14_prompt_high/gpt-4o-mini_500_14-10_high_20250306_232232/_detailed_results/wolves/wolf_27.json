            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while still competing with other wolves. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain the balance between wolf and sheep populations while still being cautious not to over-deplete the sheep. A gradual increase aligns with the current trends and ensures the long-term survival of both species."
