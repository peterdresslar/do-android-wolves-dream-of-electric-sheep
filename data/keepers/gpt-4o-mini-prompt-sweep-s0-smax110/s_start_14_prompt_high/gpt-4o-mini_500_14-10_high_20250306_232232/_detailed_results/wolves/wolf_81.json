A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still supporting our wolf population. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of making gradual changes to maintain balance.",

A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while still ensuring that the wolf population remains healthy. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while still maintaining enough pressure to ensure the wolf population remains healthy. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain a balance as the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A gradual increase in theta will support sustainable coexistence while ensuring that the sheep population can recover over time.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity slightly to allow the sheep to recover while still competing with other wolves. This adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
