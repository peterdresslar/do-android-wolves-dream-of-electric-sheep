This adjustment reflects the need to respond to the growing wolf population and the less favorable sheep-to-wolf ratio, ensuring both species can thrive without depleting resources.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. However, the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight reduction from my previous theta will help maintain balance and ensure sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, but the wolf population is also significant. A moderate approach allows for sustainable hunting while giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, and a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while we focus on maintaining our own numbers. This moderate approach helps ensure long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, and a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while we manage our competition. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, and while the wolf population is high, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain the balance without depleting the sheep too quickly, allowing for sustainable coexistence.",

This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still recovering and the wolf population is relatively high, which suggests a need for a cautious approach. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support reproduction while still prioritizing the sustainability of the sheep population and reducing competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition among wolves. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover.

            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while still maintaining enough pressure to ensure the wolves can thrive.
