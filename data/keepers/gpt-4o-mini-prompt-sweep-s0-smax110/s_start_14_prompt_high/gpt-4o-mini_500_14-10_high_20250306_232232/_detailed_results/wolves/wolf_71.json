This adjustment will help support the wolf population while still considering the need for sustainable coexistence with the sheep. A gradual increase from my previous theta will help avoid sudden population crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain a healthy population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover. This gradual adjustment will promote long-term sustainability for both species.",

This adjustment will help support the wolf population while still considering the need for sustainable coexistence with the sheep. A gradual increase is necessary to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly, especially given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio.",
