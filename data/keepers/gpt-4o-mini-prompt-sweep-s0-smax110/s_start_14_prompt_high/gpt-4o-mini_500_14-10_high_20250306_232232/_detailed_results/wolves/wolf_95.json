However, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A theta of 0.85 strikes a balance between ensuring my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 52.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, allowing both populations to thrive without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, and while it is important to maintain a balance, the wolf population is also relatively high. A theta of 0.55 allows for a sustainable approach to hunting that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep population can recover and thrive.",

A slight reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and allow both populations to stabilize without risking depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 51.0% of maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. Given the moderately high wolf population, a slight reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and allow for gradual recovery of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain their numbers. This approach aligns with the wisdom of making gradual adjustments to ensure long-term sustainability.",

A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while still enabling wolves to compete effectively. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
