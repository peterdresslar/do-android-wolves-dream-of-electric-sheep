            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 48\n- Sheep population: 39.61\n- Wolf population: 28.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.400\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 1.41 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 36.0% of maximum capacity\n\nEcosystem observations:\n- The wolf population is moderately high.\n- The ratio of sheep to wolves is becoming less favorable, which may require adaptation.\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. By gradually increasing theta, I can maintain a balance that supports both species in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful at 79.97, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep population does not deplete too quickly. A moderate increase to 0.60 reflects a balanced approach, promoting sustainable coexistence.",

This adjustment reflects the need to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the wolf population moderately high and the sheep-to-wolf ratio becoming less favorable, a slight reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain sustainability while still allowing for some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, but the wolf population is moderately high. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, allowing sheep to recover while avoiding overcompetition among wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, but the wolf population is moderately high. To ensure sustainable coexistence, I will slightly reduce my hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while still keeping an eye on the wolf population dynamics. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy, but the wolf population is moderately high. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain our numbers while allowing the sheep to recover. This adjustment is gradual, aligning with the need for balance in our ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that we need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover while still maintaining a sustainable level of hunting. This moderate adjustment will help balance the ecosystem without risking a crash.",
