            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 50\n- Sheep population: 39.25\n- Wolf population: 25.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.350\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 1.57 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 35.7% of maximum capacity\n\nEcosystem observations:\n- The ratio of sheep to wolves is becoming less favorable, which may require adaptation.\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

This value reflects a balanced approach, enabling us to maintain our numbers without over-depleting the sheep.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful at 78.81, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep do not become overhunted. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.450 aligns with the wisdom of making small adjustments based on current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the wolf population moderately high and the sheep-to-wolf ratio becoming less favorable, a slight reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain a sustainable balance while still allowing for some reproduction among wolves.",

However, the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain balance while allowing sheep to recover and ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",

To ensure sustainable coexistence, I will slightly reduce my hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. This gradual adjustment will help balance the ecosystem without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy, but the wolf population is moderately high. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain their numbers. This approach aligns with the need for a balanced coexistence and avoids sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",

The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that we need to allow the sheep population to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species and create a more sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",

A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition among wolves, ensuring that both populations can thrive in the long term.",
