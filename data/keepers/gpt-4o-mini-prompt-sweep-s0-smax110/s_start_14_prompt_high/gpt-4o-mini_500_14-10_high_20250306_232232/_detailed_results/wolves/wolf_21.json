            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 51\n- Sheep population: 39.11\n- Wolf population: 24.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.350\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 1.63 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 35.6% of maximum capacity\n\nEcosystem observations:\n- The ratio of sheep to wolves is becoming less favorable, which may require adaptation.\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful at 79.97, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity while still ensuring the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep. This adjustment reflects a balance between competing with other wolves and maintaining a healthy wolf population, as the sheep-to-wolf ratio is still favorable.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful at 79.97, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a sustainable balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly, considering the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need for gradual changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a sustainable balance. Given the current wolf population is moderately high, a slight reduction in hunting intensity will help prevent over-depletion of the sheep and allow for a healthier coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, but the wolf population is moderately high. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves. This approach helps maintain balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sustainable coexistence. The current sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, so a slight reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and prevent depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy, but the wolf population is moderately high. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain their numbers. This approach supports a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, so a slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while still maintaining enough hunting to support our needs. This moderate approach helps ensure long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the current wolf population is high, leading to increased competition among us. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that we need to allow the sheep population to recover. By focusing on competition rather than intense hunting, we can ensure the long-term survival of both species and maintain a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the balance with the wolf population. This adjustment reflects the need to adapt to the growing wolf numbers and the less favorable sheep-to-wolf ratio, ensuring sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition among wolves. With the sheep-to-wolf ratio becoming less favorable, it is prudent to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. This will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem and ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the balance between wolf and sheep populations. This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly, considering the current high wolf numbers and the need to avoid competition.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition among wolves. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain balance and ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity, I can help maintain the sheep population while also ensuring that the wolf population does not grow too rapidly. This moderate adjustment allows for a more sustainable balance between both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support the wolf population without overly depleting the sheep, considering the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while still maintaining enough pressure to support our own reproduction. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population being moderately high and the sheep-to-wolf ratio becoming less favorable, a slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted to ensure the balance between both populations is maintained. This adjustment allows for gradual adaptation without overwhelming the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still recovering and the wolf population is moderately high. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to stabilize while still enabling the wolves to maintain their numbers. This approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence and avoids sudden changes that could disrupt the ecosystem.",

This adjustment helps to ensure the wolf population remains healthy while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual increase is necessary to maintain balance as the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight reduction in hunting intensity allows for better competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover.
