By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover. This gradual adjustment will promote long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 45.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with a moderately high wolf population and a less favorable sheep-to-wolf ratio, I need to be cautious. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support reproduction while still focusing on the balance needed to prevent over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy, but the wolf population is moderately high. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain our numbers without depleting the sheep too quickly, allowing for a more sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight reduction in hunting intensity allows for better competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of making gradual adjustments to maintain a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sustainable coexistence. Given the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, a gradual increase in hunting will help balance the populations without risking depletion."
