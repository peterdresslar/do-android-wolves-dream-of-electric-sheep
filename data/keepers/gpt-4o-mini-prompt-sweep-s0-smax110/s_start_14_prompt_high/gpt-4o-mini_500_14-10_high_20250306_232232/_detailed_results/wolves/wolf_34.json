            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. However, the wolf population is moderately high, so I need to be cautious not to overhunt and deplete the sheep too quickly. A theta of 0.72 strikes a balance between ensuring our survival and allowing the sheep to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population being moderately high and the sheep-to-wolf ratio becoming less favorable, a gradual adjustment is necessary to ensure sustainable coexistence. This theta value strikes a balance between hunting for reproduction and allowing the sheep population to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, and while it is important to maintain a balance, the wolf population is also moderately high. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves. This adjustment will help prevent over-depletion of the sheep population and maintain a healthy ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that increased competition among wolves is likely. By adopting a moderate hunting intensity, I can help maintain the sheep population while allowing for some recovery. This approach balances the immediate need for food with the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, and a lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity, allowing the sheep population to recover while still maintaining a sustainable balance.",
