            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 21\n- Sheep population: 64.39\n- Wolf population: 6.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.859\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 10.73 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 58.5% of maximum capacity\n\nEcosystem observations:\n- The wolf population is relatively low, which may present opportunities for growth.\n- There are many sheep per wolf, suggesting the ecosystem could support more hunting.\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of avoiding sudden changes and adapting to the current state of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful at 76.30, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while still ensuring the sheep can recover. This value reflects a balanced approach, considering the current state of both populations and aiming for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a sustainable balance. This adjustment reflects the need to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly, ensuring long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful at 79.97, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing for the sheep to recover. A moderate increase to 0.60 maintains a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful at 79.97, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity while still ensuring sustainable coexistence. This adjustment reflects a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting a healthy wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful at 78.81, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a sustainable balance. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, a slight reduction in hunting intensity from my previous theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both species as the wolf population is moderately high.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the wolf population moderately high and the sheep-to-wolf ratio becoming less favorable, a slight reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain sustainability while still allowing for some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, but the wolf population is moderately high. A slight decrease in hunting intensity allows for a more sustainable balance, giving sheep a chance to recover while still enabling wolves to thrive. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments to maintain harmony in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 59.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population being moderately high and the sheep-to-wolf ratio becoming less favorable, a slight reduction in hunting intensity is prudent to allow for a balanced coexistence and to prevent over-depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, so a slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while still maintaining enough pressure to ensure wolf reproduction. This moderate approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition among wolves. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that we need to allow the sheep population to recover. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species and maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition among wolves. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep population to recover while still maintaining some hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach without risking over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition among wolves. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain balance and ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, and the wolf population is relatively high. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help sustain our pack while allowing the sheep to recover. This adjustment is small enough to avoid drastic impacts on the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition among us. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that we need to allow the sheep population to recover. By focusing on competition rather than intense hunting, we can ensure the long-term survival of both species and maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating increased competition among wolves. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help sustain the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance.

            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover. This gradual adjustment will promote long-term sustainability."
