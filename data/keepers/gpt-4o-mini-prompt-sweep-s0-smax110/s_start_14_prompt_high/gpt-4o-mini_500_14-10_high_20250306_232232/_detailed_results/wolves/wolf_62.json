A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while still maintaining enough pressure to support wolf reproduction. This balanced approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and sustainable coexistence.",

The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, suggesting that a more moderate approach will allow for the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to thrive. This gradual adjustment will help maintain balance in the ecosystem.",

This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that we need to focus on competition with other wolves to stabilize our population while allowing the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",

However, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, suggesting that I should be cautious and not increase hunting intensity too aggressively. A slight increase to 0.40 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep.",
