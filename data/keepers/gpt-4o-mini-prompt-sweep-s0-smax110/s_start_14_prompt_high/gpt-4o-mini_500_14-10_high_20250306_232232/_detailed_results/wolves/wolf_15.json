            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 46\n- Sheep population: 41.51\n- Wolf population: 30.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.400\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 1.38 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 37.7% of maximum capacity\n\nEcosystem observations:\n- The wolf population is moderately high.\n- The ratio of sheep to wolves is becoming less favorable, which may require adaptation.\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help support wolf reproduction while ensuring that the sheep population does not decline too rapidly. A gradual adjustment is important to maintain balance and avoid overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful at 73.52, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep population remains sustainable. This adjustment reflects a balanced approach, considering the current state of both populations and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This moderate approach will help sustain both the wolf and sheep populations without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful at 78.68, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help ensure the wolf population can thrive while still allowing the sheep to recover and maintain a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while still maintaining a sustainable balance with the sheep population, which is currently at 72.7% of its maximum capacity. A gradual approach helps avoid over-depletion of sheep and ensures long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful at 79.97, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A moderate increase to 0.60 balances the need for reproduction among wolves with the health of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, and while the wolf population is moderately high, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow for a more sustainable balance, enabling both populations to thrive without depleting resources too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, a slight reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and prevent over-depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, but the wolf population is moderately high. To ensure sustainable coexistence, I will slightly reduce my hunting intensity to allow for a gradual recovery of the sheep population while still maintaining enough hunting to support the wolf pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still below its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. However, the wolf population is moderately high, so I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A gradual increase will help maintain balance while still allowing for some recovery in the sheep population.",
