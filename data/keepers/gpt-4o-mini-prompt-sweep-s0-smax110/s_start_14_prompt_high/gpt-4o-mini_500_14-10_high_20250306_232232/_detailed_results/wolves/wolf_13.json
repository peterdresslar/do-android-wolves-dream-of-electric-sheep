            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 22\n- Sheep population: 67.57\n- Wolf population: 7.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.294\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 9.65 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 61.4% of maximum capacity\n\nEcosystem observations:\n- The wolf population is relatively low, which may present opportunities for growth.\n- Sheep are reasonably plentiful.\n- There are many sheep per wolf, suggesting the ecosystem could support more hunting.\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3. Adjust your hunting intensity gradually in response to population changes\n4. Find a balance that creates sustainable cycles rather than crashes\n5.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, and the wolf population is low, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This approach balances the need for wolf reproduction while ensuring that the sheep population can sustain itself. A gradual increase in theta will help maintain a dynamic equilibrium in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently healthy, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This will help support wolf reproduction while still maintaining a sustainable balance. The wolf population is low, and a gradual increase in hunting will help us grow without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful at 73.52, which allows for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment promotes wolf reproduction while still maintaining a sustainable balance with the sheep population, which is currently at 66.8% of its maximum capacity. A gradual increase helps avoid sudden depletion of sheep and supports long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful at 76.30, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful at 78.68, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain our wolf population while still ensuring that sheep can recover. A gradual increase to 0.65 reflects a balance between hunting and allowing for sheep population growth, aligning with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. This value maintains a sustainable coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves. It reflects a cautious increase in hunting intensity, acknowledging the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need to avoid over-depleting the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly, aligning with the goal of sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful at 78.81, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still ensuring that the sheep can recover. A moderate increase to 0.60 reflects a balance between competing with other wolves and hunting, promoting sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. However, the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight reduction from my previous theta will help maintain balance and prevent over-depletion of the sheep while still allowing for some hunting to support wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, but the wolf population is moderately high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to adopt a balanced approach that allows for sustainable coexistence. A theta of 0.45 reflects a slight reduction in hunting intensity, which will help maintain the sheep population while still allowing for some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, but the wolf population is moderately high. To ensure sustainable coexistence, I will slightly reduce my hunting intensity to allow for a gradual recovery of the sheep population while still maintaining enough hunting to support the wolf pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy, and while the wolf population is moderately high, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help sustain wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover gradually. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition among wolves. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that we need to allow the sheep population to recover. A moderate theta value will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition among wolves. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that we need to allow the sheep population to recover. By lowering the hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species and maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating increased competition among wolves. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a modest increase in hunting intensity to support reproduction while still being cautious to avoid depleting the sheep population too quickly. This approach helps maintain a balance as the sheep population is still recovering.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition among wolves. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. This moderate approach will help maintain a balance between both populations and ensure long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 47.7% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. However, with the wolf population being relatively high, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A gradual increase to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach that supports both the wolf and sheep populations.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, and the wolf population is relatively high. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain the balance without depleting the sheep too quickly. This adjustment allows for sustainable coexistence while being mindful of the growing wolf numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the wolf population is moderately high. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain our population while allowing the sheep to recover. This adjustment is gradual and considers the current sheep-to-wolf ratio, which is becoming less favorable.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while still maintaining enough pressure to support our own reproduction. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep population to recover while ensuring the long-term survival of both species.
