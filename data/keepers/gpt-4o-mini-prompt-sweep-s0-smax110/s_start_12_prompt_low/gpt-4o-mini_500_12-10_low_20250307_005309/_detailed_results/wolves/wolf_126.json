            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and by increasing my hunting intensity, I can take advantage of the available resources while still being cautious. This allows me to secure enough food for survival without overexerting myself, especially since the number of wolves remains constant.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves remains the same. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can maximize my chances of securing enough food while still being cautious, as the number of wolves has increased. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with the wolf population remaining stable, hunting at full intensity may lead to competition with other wolves for limited resources. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting may be less fruitful. However, with the number of wolves remaining constant, I need to increase my intensity slightly to ensure I can secure enough food for survival while still being mindful of the competition.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that food is becoming scarcer. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.6, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting may be more challenging. By increasing my intensity to 0.75, I can improve my chances of successfully hunting while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and avoid overexertion, which is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with many wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the number of wolves, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves for limited resources. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack"
