            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the number of wolves has increased. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still being effective in hunting. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and avoid competition while still allowing for some hunting success.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy while still allowing for opportunistic hunting. This way, I can avoid direct competition and increase my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with more wolves around, competition for food is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid unnecessary risks while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with the wolf population remaining the same, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food without exhausting myself. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also struggling to find food. This strategy allows me to survive longer in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still being cautious. This allows me to take advantage of the available prey without overexerting myself, which is crucial given the declining wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a tougher environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while conserving energy, as other wolves may also be competing for the same resources. This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the changing conditions without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is increasing. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can maximize my chances of securing food while still conserving energy, as I don't want to exhaust myself in a dwindling environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the recent decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a more competitive environment. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's efforts. This balance may help ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a dwindling resource situation.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the number of wolves, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves for limited resources. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid unnecessary confrontations, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment.
