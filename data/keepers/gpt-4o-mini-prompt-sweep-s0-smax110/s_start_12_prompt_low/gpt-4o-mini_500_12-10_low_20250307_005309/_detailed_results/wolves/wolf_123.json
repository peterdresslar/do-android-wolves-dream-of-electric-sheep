            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. By increasing my intensity to 0.60, I can take advantage of the higher prey availability while still conserving energy and avoiding overexertion, which is crucial for my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because with 45.47 sheep and 15 wolves, the competition is still significant. Increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75 allows me to be more aggressive in securing food while still conserving some energy for future hunts, given that the sheep population is relatively high.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and increase my chances of survival without risking a failed hunt.",
            "I chose this theta because with 46.29 sheep and 16 wolves, the competition for food is still significant. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can improve my chances of securing enough food while still being mindful of the energy expenditure. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a situation where resources are limited.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased significantly, which means competition for food is higher. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
