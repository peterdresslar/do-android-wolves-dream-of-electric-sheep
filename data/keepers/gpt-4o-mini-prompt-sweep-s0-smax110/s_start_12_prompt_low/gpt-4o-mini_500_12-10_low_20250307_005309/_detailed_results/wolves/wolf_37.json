            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting more challenging. With more wolves around, I need to balance my energy expenditure and avoid competition. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being able to catch prey when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.5, I can conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. This balanced approach allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics and increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, which means food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival as the competition among wolves is rising.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making them a scarcer resource. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and reduce competition for the remaining sheep. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation while still ensuring my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition with other wolves remains high. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while conserving energy for future hunts, ensuring my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves competing for fewer sheep, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and reduce the risk of failure. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity while still participating in the hunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while not overexerting myself, which could lead to exhaustion or injury. This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the current situation and ensure my survival without competing too aggressively with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a competitive environment.

This approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of resources and increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",

By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's survival. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the declining wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while still conserving energy. This approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity without overexerting myself, which is crucial for my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low, and the wolf population has decreased significantly. A lower hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who may be hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion. This allows me to secure enough resources while still conserving energy for future hunts.",

            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while conserving energy, as hunting at maximum intensity may lead to overexertion and risk of injury. This way, I can adapt to the changing conditions and ensure my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the number of wolves, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves for the same prey. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct confrontation, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in the wolf population suggests that hunting at maximum intensity could lead to overexploitation of the sheep, risking starvation for myself and my pack. By adjusting my hunting intensity to a moderate level, I can contribute to a sustainable balance while still ensuring my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, but the wolf population has decreased. This suggests that there may be less competition for food, allowing me to hunt at a lower intensity while still being effective. A lower theta will help conserve energy and reduce the risk of injury while still allowing for successful hunting."
