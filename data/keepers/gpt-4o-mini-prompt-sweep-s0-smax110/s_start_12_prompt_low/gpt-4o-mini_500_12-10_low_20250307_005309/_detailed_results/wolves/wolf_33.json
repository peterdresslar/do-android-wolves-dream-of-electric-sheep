            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential failure. By reducing my intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and still increase my chances of a successful hunt without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and avoid competition while still allowing for some hunting success.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at a higher intensity will increase my chances of securing food before other wolves can. A theta of 0.70 allows me to be competitive while still conserving some energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, while the wolf population has increased. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still contributing to the hunt when opportunities arise. This balanced approach helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, who are likely to hunt at maximum intensity. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with the wolf population remaining the same, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still find enough food without exhausting myself. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive in the hunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means food is becoming scarcer. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to survive longer in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still being cautious, as overexertion could lead to exhaustion or danger from competing wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, and the number of wolves is still high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still allowing for a chance to catch prey without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still conserving energy and avoiding overexertion. This approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity and increases my chances of survival without competing too aggressively with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexerting myself in a situation where food is scarce. This strategy allows me to survive longer while waiting for better opportunities.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion, allowing me to adapt to the current scarcity while still being cautious.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the competition among wolves is high with their population also declining. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and increase my chances of survival.",
