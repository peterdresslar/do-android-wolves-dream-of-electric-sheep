            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the wolf population has increased. By lowering my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By lowering my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with the number of wolves remaining constant, hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, ensuring my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can maximize my chances of securing enough food while still being mindful of the competition from other wolves. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and the number of wolves remains the same. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt. This balanced approach allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself, ensuring my survival in a potentially scarce environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the competition among wolves is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and reduce the risk of confrontation with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the competition among wolves is increasing. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still being effective in securing food. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the number of wolves, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves for limited resources. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and I need to balance my energy expenditure with the risk of competing with other wolves. A moderate intensity allows me to hunt effectively while conserving energy for future hunts, especially given the recent decrease in both sheep and wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests competition is still fierce. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.65, I can take advantage of the available prey while still being cautious about the risks posed by other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a more competitive environment.
