By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, allowing me to adapt to the changing dynamics and avoid competition with other wolves who may be hunting at maximum intensity.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 20 wolves competing for food, a moderate increase in hunting intensity will help me secure enough resources without overexerting myself. This way, I can balance the need to hunt effectively while also conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and less chance of a successful hunt. A slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased slightly, indicating a potential for more food. However, with the number of wolves remaining the same, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still secure enough food without overexerting myself. A theta of 0.75 allows me to be competitive while conserving energy for future hunts.",
