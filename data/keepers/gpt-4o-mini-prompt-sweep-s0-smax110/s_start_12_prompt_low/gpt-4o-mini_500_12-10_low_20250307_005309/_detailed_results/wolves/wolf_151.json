            "I chose this theta because with an increasing number of wolves, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition for food and potential starvation. By adjusting my intensity to 0.50, I can still contribute to the hunt while conserving energy and ensuring I have enough resources to survive in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting. By increasing my intensity slightly to 0.65, I can take advantage of the higher number of sheep while still conserving some energy for future hunts, considering the stable wolf population. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, which means there is enough food available. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid competing too aggressively with other wolves, ensuring my survival while still contributing to the hunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting without overwhelming competition from other wolves. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in securing food.",
            "I chose this theta because the population of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can better secure my share of the sheep while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a growing pack.",
            "I chose this theta because with an increase in the wolf population, competition for food will be higher. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance allows me to survive longer in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, which means there is enough food available. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can maximize my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself, especially since the number of wolves has remained constant.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the increased number of wolves. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves for the dwindling sheep population. This strategy allows me to survive longer while waiting for a better opportunity.",
