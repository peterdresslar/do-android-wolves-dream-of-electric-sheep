            "I chose this theta because with the increase in the wolf population, competition for food is likely to intensify. By reducing my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and with the number of wolves remaining constant, I can afford to increase my hunting intensity slightly to improve my chances of survival without overexerting myself. A moderate increase in intensity allows me to balance the need for food while conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. With more wolves in the area, hunting at a slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts. This balance increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy while still allowing for some hunting. This balance increases my chances of survival in a competitive environment.",
