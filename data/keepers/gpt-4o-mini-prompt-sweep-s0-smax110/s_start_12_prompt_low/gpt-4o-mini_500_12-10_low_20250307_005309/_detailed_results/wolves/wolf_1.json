By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can improve my chances of catching prey without overexerting myself, as I still want to conserve energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival while still being mindful of the other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, but the number of wolves remains the same. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.5, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still taking advantage of the available prey. This balance helps ensure my survival in a stable environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, with the recent decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still compete with others while also conserving energy for future hunts. A theta of 0.65 allows me to be more aggressive than before without overexerting myself."
