            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a moderate intensity will help me conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. This way, I can adapt to the changing dynamics and ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population decreasing, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food without exhausting myself. A theta of 0.50 allows me to be more efficient and conserve energy while still being competitive with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that balances my need for food with the risk of overexertion. By increasing my intensity from 0.30 to 0.50, I can take advantage of the current situation without risking depletion of the sheep population too quickly, which could jeopardize future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population increasing and the number of wolves remaining the same, a lower hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and a moderate hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself, especially given the recent decrease in both sheep and wolves."
