With more wolves around, a higher intensity increases my chances of securing a meal while still being cautious not to overexert myself. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population decreasing, it's important to conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively. A moderate intensity allows me to balance the risk of competition with other wolves while ensuring I can still catch prey if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and I want to increase my chances of a successful hunt without overexerting myself. By adjusting my intensity to 0.70, I can balance the need for food with the risk of competition from other wolves, who are likely hunting at maximum intensity.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. With an increase in the wolf population, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and overexploitation of the remaining sheep. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and ensure my survival while still contributing to the pack",
