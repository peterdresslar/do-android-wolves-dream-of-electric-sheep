            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt, ensuring my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the increased number of wolves. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves for the limited prey. This strategy allows me to survive longer while waiting for a better opportunity.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 20 wolves competing for food, hunting at a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being able to catch prey. This strategy helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased slightly, indicating that food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion. This way, I can still hunt effectively while conserving energy for future hunts, ensuring my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting more competitive among wolves. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of securing food while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a changing environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, which means food is becoming scarcer. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to survive longer in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, which means food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion. This way, I can still hunt effectively while conserving energy for future hunts, especially since the number of wolves remains constant.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, the competition for food is higher, so a lower intensity will help conserve energy while still allowing me to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching enough food without overexerting myself, as the competition with other wolves remains constant.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population decreasing, I need to increase my hunting intensity to ensure I can secure enough food for survival. However, I want to avoid overexerting myself since the wolf population remains stable, and I need to conserve energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the increase in wolves means competition for food is rising. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population decreasing, I need to balance my hunting efforts to ensure I can still find enough food while not overexerting myself. A slightly higher intensity than before allows me to adapt to the changing environment without risking depletion of resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, which means food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can improve my chances of catching enough food while still conserving energy. This balance is crucial for my survival, especially with the number of wolves remaining constant.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This approach allows me to adapt to the current situation and increases my chances of survival without competing too aggressively with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting may be less fruitful.
