By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the sheep population while still being mindful of the increased competition from other wolves. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With an increase in the wolf population, competition for food will be higher. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts, increasing my chances of survival in a more competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment.

A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's efforts, increasing my chances of survival.",

By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can better secure food while still conserving energy, as the sheep population has decreased. This balance will help ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",

This balance increases my chances of survival in a competitive environment.",

            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and while the wolf population has increased, hunting at maximum intensity may lead to competition with other wolves for the limited prey. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt, ensuring my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making hunting more challenging. By increasing my intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of successfully hunting while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with the number of wolves remaining the same, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to overexploitation of the remaining sheep. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and ensure that I have enough resources for future hunts while still contributing to the pack's survival.",

This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",

However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition is lower, allowing for a more moderate approach to hunting.
