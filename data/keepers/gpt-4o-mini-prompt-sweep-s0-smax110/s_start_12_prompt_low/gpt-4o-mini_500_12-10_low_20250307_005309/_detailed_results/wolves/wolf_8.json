            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is stable, and with 10 wolves competing for the same prey, a moderate increase in hunting intensity will help me secure food without exhausting myself. This balance allows me to remain competitive while conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because with the number of sheep increasing and the wolf population remaining stable, a slightly reduced hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive. This way, I can adapt to the situation and increase my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, but the wolf population has decreased. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still allowing for a sustainable hunt. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, with the recent decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance the risk of overexerting myself while still ensuring I contribute to the pack's survival. A theta of 0.60 allows me to hunt effectively without exhausting myself or drawing too much attention.",
