            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with the wolf population remaining the same, competition for food will be high. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of catching enough food while still conserving energy, as the sheep population is not sufficient for all wolves to hunt at maximum intensity.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the overall trend shows a decline in the wolf population. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",
