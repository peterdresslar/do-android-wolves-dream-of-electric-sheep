By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.6, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting may be less successful. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the population of sheep is relatively low compared to the number of wolves, and hunting at a lower intensity will help conserve energy and resources. With the recent decrease in both sheep and wolves, it's wise to be cautious and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, with the recent decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still secure food while avoiding overexertion. A moderate intensity allows me to be more strategic and conserve energy."
