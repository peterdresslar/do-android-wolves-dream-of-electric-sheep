            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity reduces the risk of competition and allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, which means there is enough food available. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively. This strategy allows me to avoid overexertion and increases my chances of survival in the long run, especially since the number of wolves has remained stable.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased slightly, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. By choosing a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, especially since the number of wolves has remained stable. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is increasing. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a changing environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased slightly, and the number of wolves remains stable. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt. This balance may help ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a potentially dwindling food supply.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and with 20 wolves, competition for food is present. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can improve my chances of securing a meal while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at full intensity could lead to competition and less food for me. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the increase in wolves means competition for food is higher. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased slightly, indicating that hunting may be less fruitful if I go all out. By increasing my intensity from 0.40 to 0.50, I can balance the need to hunt effectively while conserving energy for future hunts, ensuring my survival in a fluctuating environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of securing a meal while still conserving energy. This balance is crucial for my survival, especially with the current number of wolves remaining constant.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy while still participating in hunts. This balance increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting may be less successful. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy while still participating in hunts with other wolves, allowing me to adapt to the current situation and ensure my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion. This allows me to remain competitive with other wolves while conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can maximize my chances of securing a meal while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting may be less successful. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's efforts. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the competition among wolves is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of securing food while still being cautious, as overexertion could lead to exhaustion or injury. This balance helps ensure my survival in a declining population."
