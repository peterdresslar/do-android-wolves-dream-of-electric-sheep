This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",

This balance is crucial for my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, and the number of wolves is still relatively high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the number of wolves, and the recent decrease in both populations suggests that hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves for limited resources. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's survival.",

By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to hunt effectively while also conserving energy and avoiding overexertion. This approach allows me to adapt to the declining wolf population and ensure my survival without risking too much competition with other wolves.",

With the wolf population decreasing, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, ensuring my survival in the long run.",
