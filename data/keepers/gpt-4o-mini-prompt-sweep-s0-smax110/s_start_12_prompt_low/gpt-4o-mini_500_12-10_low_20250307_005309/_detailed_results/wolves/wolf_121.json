            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population increasing and the number of wolves remaining the same, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to balance the need for food while avoiding overexertion. This way, I can conserve energy and still contribute to the pack's survival without risking depletion of resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of catching enough prey while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a more competitive environment.",

            "I chose this theta because with a stable number of wolves and a slight increase in sheep, I need to balance my hunting intensity. A theta of 0.50 allows me to be competitive without overexerting myself, ensuring I can conserve energy for future hunts while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased significantly, which means competition for food is higher. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This balance helps ensure my survival in a crowded environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, indicating more food availability. However, the number of wolves remains the same, which means competition for food is still present. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can take advantage of the higher sheep numbers while still being cautious about overexerting myself and risking injury or depletion of resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the wolf population is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still contributing to the pack's overall success. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and ensure my survival.",

With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and reduce competition for the remaining sheep. This strategy allows me to survive longer while waiting for a better opportunity.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased slightly, which means food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity from 0.30 to 0.40, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy. This balance is crucial for my survival, especially with other wolves competing for the same resources.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population decreasing, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food while not overexerting myself. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy and adapt to the current situation, where competition with other wolves is still present.",
