            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a potentially scarce environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 12 wolves competing for food, a moderate increase in hunting intensity will help me secure enough resources without overexerting myself. This balance allows me to be more strategic and conserve energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because with an increasing number of wolves, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition for the same prey, which may not be sustainable given the current sheep population. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt, ensuring my survival in a crowded environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of securing food while still conserving energy. This balance helps ensure my survival in a more competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the increased number of wolves. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves for the limited prey. This strategy allows me to survive longer while waiting for better opportunities.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a more competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and I want to increase my chances of a successful hunt while also conserving energy. By increasing my intensity slightly from my previous theta, I can take advantage of the current situation without overexerting myself, especially since the number of wolves has remained stable.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. With an increase in the wolf population, competition for resources will be higher. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise. This balance will help ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the increase in the wolf population, competition for food is likely to be higher. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, while still contributing to the pack's overall success. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and ensure my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population decreasing, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food while not overexerting myself. A moderate intensity allows me to adapt to the changing environment and increases my chances of survival without competing too aggressively with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy and avoid competition while still allowing for some hunting. This way, I can adapt to the current situation and ensure my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population increasing and the number of wolves remaining stable, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to balance the need for food while minimizing competition with other wolves. By not hunting at maximum intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid drawing attention to myself.",

A moderate intensity allows me to adapt to the changing environment and increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means food is becoming scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential failure. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's survival.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and I want to increase my chances of a successful hunt without overexerting myself. By adjusting my intensity to 0.65, I can balance the need to hunt effectively while conserving energy for future hunts, especially since the number of wolves remains constant.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, which means hunting is becoming more competitive. By increasing my intensity slightly from 0.65 to 0.75, I can improve my chances of catching enough food while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a changing environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting might be less successful. By lowering my intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, allowing me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself.",

This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting might be less fruitful. However, I want to maintain a competitive edge over other wolves, so I increase my intensity slightly from my previous theta to ensure I can secure enough food while still being mindful of the dwindling prey.",

            "I chose this theta because the decrease in the wolf population indicates increased competition for food. By raising my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure enough food while conserving energy, as the sheep population is still relatively high. This approach allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the number of wolves, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves for a limited food source. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid drawing attention while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests competition is fierce. By adjusting my intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to hunt effectively while conserving energy and avoiding overexertion, which is crucial for my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the stable number of wolves.
