            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a more cautious approach. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the increased sheep population while still being mindful of the competition from other wolves. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in both sheep and wolves indicates a more competitive environment. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexerting myself and attracting attention from other wolves. This moderate approach allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the current situation without overexerting myself, as the competition among wolves is increasing. This balance helps ensure my survival while still allowing for a successful hunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves, which means there is enough food available. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the current situation without overexerting myself, ensuring I can still survive and thrive in the pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased significantly, which means competition for food is higher. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival in a more competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the wolf population, which means there is enough food available. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival in a growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. However, the increase in the wolf population suggests competition for food is rising. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of securing food while still conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With an increase in the wolf population, competition for food is higher. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the number of wolves has increased. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making them scarcer. With an increase in the wolf population, hunting at a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy and avoid competition, ensuring my survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making them scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and failure. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, balancing the risk of overexertion with the need to secure food.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, while the wolf population has increased. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, allowing me to survive longer until the sheep population recovers.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer.
