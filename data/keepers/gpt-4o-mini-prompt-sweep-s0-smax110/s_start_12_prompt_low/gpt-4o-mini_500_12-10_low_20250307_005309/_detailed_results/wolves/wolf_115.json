            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential failure. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and wait for a better opportunity to hunt when the conditions are more favorable.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased slightly, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity from 0.30 to 0.40, I can better compete with other wolves while still conserving energy. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means hunting may become more competitive. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while conserving energy for future hunts, as the wolf population remains stable.",

By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid unnecessary risks while still contributing to the pack's survival. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and increases my chances of survival in the long run.",
