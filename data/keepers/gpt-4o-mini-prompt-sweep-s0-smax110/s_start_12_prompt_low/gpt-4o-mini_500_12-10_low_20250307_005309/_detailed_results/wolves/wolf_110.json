This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself, especially since the number of wolves has remained constant.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, but the wolf population has decreased. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still taking advantage of the available prey. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, indicating a good opportunity for hunting. However, with the number of wolves remaining the same, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food without exhausting myself or risking competition with other wolves. A theta of 0.60 allows me to be more efficient while still conserving energy.",
            "I chose this theta because with the current number of sheep at 30.03 and wolves at 12.00, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still taking advantage of the available prey. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
