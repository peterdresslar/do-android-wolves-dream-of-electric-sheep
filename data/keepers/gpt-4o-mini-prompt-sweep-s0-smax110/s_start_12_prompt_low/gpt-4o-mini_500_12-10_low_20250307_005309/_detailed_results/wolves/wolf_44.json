By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",

By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment.

By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overhunting, which could further deplete the sheep population and threaten my survival. This moderate approach allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's needs.",
