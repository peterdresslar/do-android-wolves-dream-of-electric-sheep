            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the number of wolves. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves for the limited prey. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the number of sheep increasing and the number of wolves remaining the same, I need to balance my hunting intensity. A theta of 0.50 allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting. However, with the recent decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food while conserving energy for future hunts. A theta of 0.75 allows me to be competitive without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. With the recent decrease in the wolf population, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's survival. This balance helps ensure I can hunt effectively without risking injury or depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the decreased wolf population. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still taking advantage of the available prey. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. With fewer wolves around, I can afford to increase my hunting intensity to secure food while still being cautious, as the overall wolf population has decreased. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. By increasing my intensity to 0.75, I can take advantage of this situation while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, which means there is more food available. However, with the number of wolves remaining the same, I can afford to hunt at a slightly lower intensity to conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves. This balance allows me to ensure my survival while still being effective in hunting."
