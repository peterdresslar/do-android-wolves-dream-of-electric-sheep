            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with more wolves than sheep, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to overexertion and potential failure. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival in a competitive environment.",

By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of securing food while still being cautious not to overexert myself given the declining prey availability.",
            "I chose this theta because the population of sheep is decreasing, and with fewer sheep available, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves for limited resources. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's survival.",
