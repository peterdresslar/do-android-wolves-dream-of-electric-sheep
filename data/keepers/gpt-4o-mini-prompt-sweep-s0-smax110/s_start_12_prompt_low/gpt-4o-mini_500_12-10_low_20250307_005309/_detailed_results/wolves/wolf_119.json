However, with the recent decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I don't overexert myself and risk injury or exhaustion. A moderate intensity of 0.50 allows me to contribute to the pack's survival while also being cautious.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, with the decrease in the wolf population, I need to be cautious and not overexert myself. A theta of 0.70 allows me to hunt effectively while conserving energy for potential competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased slightly, which means there is more food available. However, the number of wolves has remained the same, indicating competition for food is still present. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively if needed. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low, and the recent decrease in the wolf population indicates increased competition for food. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid drawing attention while still having a chance to catch prey. This strategy may help ensure my survival in a challenging environment."
