            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the number of wolves, which means competition for food is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because with 41.02 sheep and 10 wolves, the competition for food is significant. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure enough food for survival while avoiding overexertion that could lead to exhaustion or injury. This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the current situation without risking too much energy.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. By increasing my intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the higher sheep numbers while still conserving energy for future hunts, especially since the wolf population remains stable.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and with an increase in wolves, competition for food will be fierce. By lowering my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 11 wolves competing for food, increasing my hunting intensity will improve my chances of securing a meal while still conserving energy compared to maximum intensity. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the increase in the wolf population, competition for food is likely to intensify. By lowering my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival in a more competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a more sustainable hunt. By increasing my intensity slightly from 0.60 to 0.75, I can take advantage of the current situation without overexerting myself or depleting the sheep population too quickly. This balance helps ensure my survival while still allowing for future hunting opportunities.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased significantly, which means competition for food is higher. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because with an increase in the wolf population, competition for food will be higher. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the hunt. This balance allows me to survive in a crowded environment without risking depletion of resources.",
            "I chose this theta because with 48.82 sheep and 15 wolves, the competition for food is significant. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly to 0.60, I can improve my chances of catching prey without overexerting myself, which is crucial for my survival in a stable wolf population. This balance allows me to be more efficient while still conserving energy.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased slightly, and the wolf population has increased.
