            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population means more competition for food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.65, I can better secure my share of the dwindling sheep population while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy while still allowing for successful hunts. This balance increases my chances of survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and avoid competition for limited prey. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the current number of sheep and wolves, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to balance the risk of overexertion with the need to secure food. By not hunting at maximum intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid attracting attention from other wolves, while still being effective in securing enough resources for survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased slightly, and the number of wolves remains the same. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 19 wolves competing for food, a moderate hunting intensity will allow me to secure enough resources without overexerting myself. This balance helps ensure my survival while still being cautious of the competition.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, and with more wolves around, competition for food is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexerting myself in a challenging environment. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation while still contributing to the pack's survival.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population decreasing, it's important to balance my hunting intensity. A theta of 0.50 allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive enough to catch prey. This way, I can adapt to the changing environment and ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
