However, with the number of wolves remaining constant, I need to balance my hunting intensity to avoid competition with other wolves while still increasing my chances of a successful hunt. A theta of 0.55 allows me to be more aggressive than my previous choice while still being cautious.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means food is becoming scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and risk of injury. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid confrontations while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
