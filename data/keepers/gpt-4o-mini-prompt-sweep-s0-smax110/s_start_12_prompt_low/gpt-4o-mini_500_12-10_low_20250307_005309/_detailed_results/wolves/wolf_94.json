            "I chose this theta because with an increase in the wolf population, competition for food will be higher. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.80, I can conserve energy and avoid overhunting, ensuring I have enough resources for survival while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a more cautious approach. By reducing my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still having a chance to catch prey. This balance helps ensure my survival in a stable environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the increase in the wolf population, competition for food is rising. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 12 wolves competing for food, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to be more strategic. By not hunting at maximum intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, while still increasing my chances of a successful hunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance allows me to survive in a challenging environment without risking depletion of resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.65, I can improve my chances of successfully catching prey while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for the available sheep. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of successfully catching sheep while still conserving some energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, and with the number of wolves remaining stable, hunting at maximum intensity may lead to overexploitation of the sheep. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and ensure that I still have enough resources while allowing the sheep population to recover slightly, which could benefit my long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, which means food is becoming scarcer. With an increase in the wolf population, competition for food will be higher.
