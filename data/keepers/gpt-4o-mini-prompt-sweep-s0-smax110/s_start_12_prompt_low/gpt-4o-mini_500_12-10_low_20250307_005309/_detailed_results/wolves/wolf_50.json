            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting more challenging. Increasing my hunting intensity to 0.65 allows me to be more competitive against other wolves while still conserving energy for future hunts, as the sheep population is low.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and reduce competition for the remaining sheep. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with the number of wolves remaining the same, competition for food will be high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in sheep indicates that hunting is becoming more challenging. By increasing my intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion, ensuring I can still hunt effectively while conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the wolf population is also declining. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who might be hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey while still ensuring my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is high. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid drawing attention to myself while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.40, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a competitive situation.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a more competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of securing food while still conserving energy, as I don",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low, and the wolf population has decreased. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who may be hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to survive longer while waiting for a more favorable situation.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a more competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can take advantage of the reduced sheep population while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and with fewer sheep available, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to wasted energy and increased competition with other wolves. By lowering my intensity to 0.40, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt when opportunities arise, ensuring my survival in a challenging environment.",
