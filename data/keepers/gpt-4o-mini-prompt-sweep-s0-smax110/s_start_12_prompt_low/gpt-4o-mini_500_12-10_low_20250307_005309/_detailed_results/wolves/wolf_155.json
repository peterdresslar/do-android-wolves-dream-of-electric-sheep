By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves while still contributing to the pack's overall success. This cautious approach helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the number of wolves. By increasing my hunting intensity from 0.10 to 0.30, I can take advantage of the abundant prey while still conserving energy. This approach allows me to remain competitive with other wolves without overexerting myself, ensuring my survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because with the increase in the wolf population, competition for food is likely to intensify. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a potentially scarce environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the increase in both sheep and wolves, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to balance the need for food while minimizing competition with other wolves. By not hunting at maximum intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid drawing too much attention to myself, ensuring my survival in a growing pack.",
            "I chose this theta because with the current number of sheep and wolves, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective. This way, I can adapt to the fluctuating availability of prey and avoid overexertion, ensuring my survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means food is becoming scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and overexploitation of the remaining sheep. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and wait for a better opportunity while still participating in the hunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is increasing. By adjusting my hunting intensity to a moderate level, I can conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a potentially scarce environment.",
