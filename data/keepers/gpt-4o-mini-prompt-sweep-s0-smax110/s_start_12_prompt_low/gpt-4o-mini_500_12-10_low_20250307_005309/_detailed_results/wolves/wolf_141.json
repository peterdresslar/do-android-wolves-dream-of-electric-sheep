            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tighter competition for food. With more wolves around, a slightly higher intensity will help me secure enough food while still being cautious not to overexert myself. This balance increases my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the wolf population has increased. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 20 wolves competing for food, a moderate increase in hunting intensity will improve my chances of securing a meal without exhausting myself. This balance allows me to be more strategic in my hunting while still being competitive.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, which means hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and increase my chances of survival in a competitive environment with more wolves. This way, I can still contribute to the pack while being mindful of the dwindling prey.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means hunting might become more competitive. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can improve my chances of securing food while still conserving energy compared to maximum intensity. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and overexploitation of the remaining sheep. By lowering my intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and still have a chance to hunt successfully without risking a complete depletion of resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy while still allowing for some hunting. This strategy increases my chances of survival by avoiding competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased recently, indicating a potential scarcity of food. With more wolves in the area, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and overexploitation of the remaining sheep.
