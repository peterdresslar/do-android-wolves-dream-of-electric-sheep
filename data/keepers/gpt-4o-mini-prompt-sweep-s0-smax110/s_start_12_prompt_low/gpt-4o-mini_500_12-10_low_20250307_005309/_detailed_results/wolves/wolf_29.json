            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, competition for food is increasing. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts, increasing my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance my need for food with the risk of overexertion and potential failure in catching prey. This moderate approach allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With an increase in the wolf population, competition for food will be higher. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of securing food while still conserving some energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, while the wolf population has increased. A lower hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still participating in the hunt when opportunities arise. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making them scarcer. With more wolves around, I need to increase my hunting intensity to ensure I can secure enough food for survival. A theta of 0.60 balances the need for food with the risk of overexertion.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making them a scarcer resource. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to survive longer in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, which means food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion and competition with other wolves. This way, I can still contribute to my survival while being mindful of the changing environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high with their numbers also declining. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a more competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while conserving energy, as the sheep population is still relatively low. This approach allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, and the number of wolves is also declining. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, ensuring my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can strike a balance between conserving energy and increasing my chances of securing food, while still being cautious of the dwindling sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the competition among wolves is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's survival. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the declining wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion, ensuring I still have energy to survive while contributing to the pack",
