            "I chose this theta because with the increase in both sheep and wolves, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves for the same prey. By lowering my intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and avoid direct confrontation, while still contributing to the pack's success.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food while avoiding overexertion. Increasing my intensity slightly to 0.75 allows me to be more competitive without risking depletion of resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, which means there is enough food available. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to secure enough food for survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased significantly, which means competition for food is higher. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and ensure my survival without risking depletion of resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can better secure my share of the sheep while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a growing pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can better secure my share of the dwindling sheep population while still conserving some energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid unnecessary confrontations with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively when needed. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a crowded environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy and avoid competition while still allowing for some hunting success.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests that competition for food will be higher. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can better secure food while still being cautious not to overexert myself, given the recent decrease in sheep numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and reduce competition for food. This way, I can still hunt effectively without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By raising my hunting intensity slightly, I can better secure my share of the dwindling sheep population while still being cautious, as overexerting could lead to exhaustion or failure.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making it harder to find food. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion without a guaranteed reward. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, adapting to the current scarcity.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential failure. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, which means hunting is becoming more challenging. By increasing my intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to hunt effectively while conserving energy for future hunts. This approach allows me to adapt to the changing environment without overexerting myself, ensuring my survival.",

            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment.

This approach allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself.",
