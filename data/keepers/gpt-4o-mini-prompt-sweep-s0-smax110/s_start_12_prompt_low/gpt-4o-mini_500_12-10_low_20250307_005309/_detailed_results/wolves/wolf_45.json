            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, which means hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can still contribute to my survival while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep. This balanced approach allows me to adapt to the changing environment and the increasing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making them a scarcer resource. With the increase in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to avoid competition while still ensuring I can secure enough food. A moderate increase in theta allows me to hunt effectively without overexerting myself or drawing too much attention from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting more challenging. By adjusting my intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still being competitive in the hunt. This balance allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself, especially since the wolf population is increasing.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, which means there is less food available. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This balance will help ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is increasing. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to hunt effectively while conserving energy and avoiding overexertion in a challenging environment. This strategy may help ensure my survival while still contributing to the pack's success.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and the number of wolves has also decreased. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who may be hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to survive longer while waiting for better conditions.",
