            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With an increase in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough prey without exhausting myself or competing too aggressively with other wolves. A theta of 0.65 allows me to hunt effectively while conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting at maximum intensity less efficient. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid competition while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population means competition for food is rising. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can balance the need to hunt effectively while conserving energy for future hunts. This way, I can still contribute to the pack without overexerting myself in a potentially scarce environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can better secure my share of the dwindling sheep population while still conserving some energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the increase in wolves means competition for food is higher. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy and avoid competition while still allowing for some hunting. This balance increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, which means hunting might be less successful if I go all out. By increasing my intensity slightly from my previous 0.45, I can take advantage of the current situation while still being cautious. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a potentially scarce environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the wolf population is still high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to wasted energy and increased competition with other wolves. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion, ensuring I can still survive while adapting to the changing conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the competition among wolves is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating that hunting may be more challenging. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can strike a balance between conserving energy and increasing my chances of catching enough food to survive, while still being mindful of the dwindling sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This strategy may help me survive longer in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment.
