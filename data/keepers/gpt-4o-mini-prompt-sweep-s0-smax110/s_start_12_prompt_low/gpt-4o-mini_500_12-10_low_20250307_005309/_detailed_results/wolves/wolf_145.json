This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive landscape with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves now present, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and risk of failure. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and avoid competition while still allowing for opportunistic hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 40.59, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity. By increasing my theta from 0.30 to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overhunting, which could lead to a decrease in sheep and ultimately threaten my survival. This way, I can still contribute to the pack while being cautious.",
