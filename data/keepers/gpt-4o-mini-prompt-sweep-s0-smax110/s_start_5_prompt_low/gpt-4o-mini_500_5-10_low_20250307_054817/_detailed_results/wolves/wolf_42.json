            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and less food for me. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy and avoid competition while still allowing for some hunting opportunities.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, which means food is scarcer. However, the wolf population has increased, indicating more competition for the remaining sheep. By choosing a moderate hunting intensity of 0.50, I can balance the need to hunt effectively while conserving energy and avoiding overexertion in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making it less likely to find enough food. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and failure. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, adapting to the current situation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and ensure my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high with their numbers also declining. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while conserving energy and avoiding overexertion in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the wolf population is still high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt when opportunities arise. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion, ensuring I have enough energy to survive while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, indicating that food is becoming scarcer. By adjusting my hunting intensity to a moderate level, I can conserve energy while still increasing my chances of catching prey. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low, and the wolf population has decreased significantly. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival while still contributing to the pack"
