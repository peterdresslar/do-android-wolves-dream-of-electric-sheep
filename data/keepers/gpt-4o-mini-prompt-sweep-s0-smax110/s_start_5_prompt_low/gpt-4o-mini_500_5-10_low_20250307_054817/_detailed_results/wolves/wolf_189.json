            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and reduced success. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting more challenging. By increasing my intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion, especially with more wolves around competing for the same resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and risk of failure. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because with the increase in the wolf population, competition for food is likely to intensify. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while conserving energy and avoiding overexertion. This strategy allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics of the pack and the available prey.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, I need to increase my hunting intensity to compete effectively for the limited resources. A theta of 0.65 allows me to balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and increase my chances of survival while still contributing to the pack's efforts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, which means food is scarcer. Increasing my hunting intensity slightly to 0.60 allows me to be more competitive without overexerting myself, given the rising wolf population. This balance helps ensure my survival while still being mindful of the limited resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting may be less fruitful. However, with the number of wolves remaining stable, I need to increase my hunting intensity slightly to ensure I can secure enough food for survival while still being mindful of the competition.",
