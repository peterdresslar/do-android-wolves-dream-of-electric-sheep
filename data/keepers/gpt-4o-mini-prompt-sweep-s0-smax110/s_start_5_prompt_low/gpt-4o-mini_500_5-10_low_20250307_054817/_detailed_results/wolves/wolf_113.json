            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the increase in wolves means competition for food is higher. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still being effective in catching prey, balancing my need for food with the risk of overexertion in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting at maximum intensity less efficient. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise. This balance increases my chances of survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and while the wolf population has increased, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food without overexerting myself. A moderate intensity allows me to be efficient while also conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, which means hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly to 0.70, I can take advantage of the current situation while still being cautious about the dwindling prey. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a potentially scarce environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with more wolves around, competition for food is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This balanced approach helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the declining wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while conserving energy, as the competition among wolves is still high. This allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself.",

            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food.
