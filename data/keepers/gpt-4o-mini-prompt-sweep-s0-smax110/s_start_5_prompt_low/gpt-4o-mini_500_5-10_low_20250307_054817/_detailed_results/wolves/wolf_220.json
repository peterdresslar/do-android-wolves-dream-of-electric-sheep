            "I chose this theta because while the sheep population is still relatively high, the increase in wolves suggests more competition for food. By lowering my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the hunt. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively stable, and with the number of wolves remaining the same, a slightly reduced intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive in hunting. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a potentially saturated hunting environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means food is becoming scarcer. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased while the wolf population has increased. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves for limited prey. This strategy allows me to survive longer in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population decreasing, I need to increase my hunting intensity to ensure I can secure enough food for survival. However, I want to avoid overexerting myself in a situation where the wolf population remains stable, which could lead to competition for the same resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and wait for a better opportunity to hunt when the conditions improve.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population decreasing, I need to increase my hunting intensity to secure enough food for survival. However, I must balance this with the risk of overhunting, which could lead to a depletion of resources in the future. A theta of 0.60 allows me to be more aggressive while still being mindful of sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential failure. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and adapt to the changing environment while still participating in hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of catching enough prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival as the competition among wolves remains high.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting may be more challenging.
