            "I chose this theta because with the increase in the wolf population, competition for food is likely to be higher. A lower hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and while the wolf population has increased, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food without overexerting myself. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making it less necessary to hunt at maximum intensity. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less predictable. With more wolves in the area, a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts. This balance increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential failure. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in sheep indicates a scarcity of food, and a moderate hunting intensity will help me conserve energy while still increasing my chances of catching prey. This balance is crucial for my survival, especially with the recent decline in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still allowing for opportunistic hunting if conditions improve.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while conserving energy, as the competition among wolves is high. This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with the wolf population also declining, it may be wise to conserve energy and avoid overexertion. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can still contribute to the pack's survival while ensuring I have enough resources for myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while conserving energy, as hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable given the current low sheep population. This approach allows me to adapt to the situation and improve my chances of survival.",
