            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance increases my chances of survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential failure. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, indicating a scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while also conserving energy, as the overall wolf population is still high. This approach allows me to adapt to the changing environment and ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves for limited prey. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I aim to balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion. This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity while still being cautious.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and increase my chances of survival in a challenging environment where resources are limited.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while conserving energy and avoiding overexertion. This approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the declining wolf population, ensuring my survival without risking too much competition with others.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and the number of wolves has decreased significantly. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to catch enough food to survive. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and increase my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and with the recent decrease in both sheep and wolves, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to overexploitation of the remaining sheep. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and increase my chances of survival while still contributing to the pack's needs.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment.

By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the wolf population, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves. By choosing a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt, allowing for a better chance of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the wolf population, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves for the same prey. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid unnecessary confrontations, increasing my chances of survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, but the wolf population has decreased significantly. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while also being cautious not to overexert myself in a competitive environment. This way, I can ensure my survival without risking too much energy in a potentially dangerous hunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the number of wolves, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves for limited prey. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid drawing attention to myself, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. With the recent decrease in the wolf population, a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive in the hunt. This balance helps ensure my survival in a changing environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition is still a concern. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can take advantage of the available prey while still being cautious about the risks posed by other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, but the wolf population has decreased. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, indicating more food availability. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests competition is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, with the recent decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still compete for food while also conserving energy. A moderate intensity of 0.50 allows me to hunt effectively without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests competition is high, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to overexertion or conflict with other wolves. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population increasing and the number of wolves remaining the same, I can afford to increase my hunting intensity slightly. This allows me to take advantage of the growing food supply while still being cautious, as other wolves may also be hunting at maximum intensity. A moderate increase helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests competition is fierce. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can take advantage of the abundant prey while still being cautious about the risks posed by other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because with 18.70 sheep and 7 wolves, the competition for food is moderate. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can improve my chances of catching prey without overexerting myself, as the sheep population is still relatively high. This balance helps ensure my survival while being mindful of the other wolves."
