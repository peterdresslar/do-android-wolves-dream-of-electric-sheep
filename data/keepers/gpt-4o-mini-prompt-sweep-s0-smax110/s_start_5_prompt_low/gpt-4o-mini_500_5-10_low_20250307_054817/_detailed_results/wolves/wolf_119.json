            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can better secure my share of the dwindling sheep population while still conserving energy for future hunts.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and reduce competition for the remaining sheep. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation while still ensuring my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food without exhausting myself. A moderate increase in intensity allows me to adapt to the current situation while still conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This balance helps ensure my survival in a dwindling resource situation.",

By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still being cautious. This allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself, which could lead to exhaustion or danger from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high with their population also declining.

            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the competition among wolves is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competing directly with others for fewer resources. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a more competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while conserving energy, as the sheep population is still relatively high. This approach allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics and ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
