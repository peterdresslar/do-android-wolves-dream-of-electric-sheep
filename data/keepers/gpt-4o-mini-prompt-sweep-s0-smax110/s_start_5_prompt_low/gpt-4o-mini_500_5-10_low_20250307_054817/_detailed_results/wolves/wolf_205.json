By increasing my hunting intensity from 0.40 to 0.60, I can improve my chances of securing food while still conserving energy. This balance is crucial for my survival, especially with the current competition from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy, as the competition with other wolves remains constant. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating less food availability. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.5, I can conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population decreasing, I need to increase my hunting intensity to secure enough food for survival. However, I want to avoid overexerting myself, as the wolf population remains constant and competition for food is still present. A theta of 0.75 strikes a balance between ensuring I get enough food while not exhausting myself too quickly."
