            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. Increasing my hunting intensity slightly will improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts, especially with the growing wolf population. A balance is needed to ensure survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means hunting intensity needs to be higher to secure enough food for survival. However, I want to avoid overexertion and risk injury, so I will increase my intensity moderately from my previous level.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This balanced approach helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population means more competition for food. By raising my hunting intensity, I can increase my chances of catching prey before other wolves do, ensuring my survival in a more competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with more wolves around, competition for food is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's efforts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and increase my chances of survival in a competitive environment where other wolves are also hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and wait for a more favorable opportunity.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting may be more challenging. By increasing my intensity slightly to 0.60, I can improve my chances of a successful hunt while still conserving energy for future needs. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting may be less fruitful. By lowering my intensity slightly, I can conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment where resources are limited.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating less food availability. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, allowing me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself. This balance increases my chances of survival as I can still contribute to the pack without risking depletion of my own resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of catching enough food while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival as competition with other wolves remains constant.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, and the number of wolves is also declining. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid competing too aggressively with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the population of sheep is decreasing, which means hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and increase my chances of survival in a declining wolf population. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food while avoiding competition with other wolves. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy and adapt to the changing dynamics of the pack.",
