By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid drawing attention to myself while still contributing to the pack's overall success. This strategy allows me to survive longer in a more competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity.

This approach helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high compared to the wolf population, and I need to increase my hunting intensity to secure enough food for survival. With other wolves increasing in number, a moderate increase in my hunting intensity will help me compete effectively without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means food is becoming scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at full intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt, ensuring my survival in a challenging environment.",

By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential failure. A moderate increase in intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive in the hunt.",
