            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting more challenging. With an increase in the wolf population, a lower hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population decreasing, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food while avoiding overexertion. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy and adapt to the changing environment, especially since other wolves are also competing for the same resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my intensity to 0.75, I can enhance my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive situation with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means food is becoming scarcer. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and increase my chances of survival while still contributing to the hunt. This balance allows me to adapt to the changing environment without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population decreasing, I need to increase my hunting intensity to secure enough food for survival. However, I must be cautious not to overexert myself, as the wolf population remains stable, and competition for prey is still present.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy while still being proactive in hunting. This balance allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself, ensuring my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting might be more challenging. By increasing my intensity slightly from my previous theta of 0.60 to 0.75, I can maximize my chances of securing enough food while still being mindful of the competition from other wolves.",
