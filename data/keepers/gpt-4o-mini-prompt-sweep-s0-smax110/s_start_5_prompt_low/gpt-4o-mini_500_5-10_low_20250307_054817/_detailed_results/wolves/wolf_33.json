            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased significantly, which means competition for food is higher. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively. This balance allows me to adapt to the changing environment and ensure my survival without risking depletion of resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, I need to increase my hunting intensity to compete effectively for the limited resources. A theta of 0.70 allows me to balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with more wolves around, competition for food will be fierce. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still participating in hunts, allowing me to adapt to the changing environment and ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, which means hunting is becoming more competitive among wolves. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of successfully catching prey while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a changing environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy while still allowing for potential success in hunting. This balance increases my chances of survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with an increase in the number of wolves, competition for food will be fierce. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and increases my chances of survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, which means hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. By choosing a moderate intensity, I can still contribute to the hunt while conserving energy and ensuring my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with more wolves competing for the same prey, a lower hunting intensity will help conserve energy and increase my chances of survival. By hunting less aggressively, I can avoid direct competition and wait for better opportunities.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion, allowing me to adapt to the current scarcity while still being cautious.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the number of wolves, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves for the limited prey. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct confrontation, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexerting myself in a dwindling population of prey. This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the current situation while still being cautious."
