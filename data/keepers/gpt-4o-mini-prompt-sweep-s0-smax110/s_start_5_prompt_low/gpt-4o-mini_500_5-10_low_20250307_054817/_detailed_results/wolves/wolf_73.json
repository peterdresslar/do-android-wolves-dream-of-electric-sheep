            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts. This way, I can adapt to the changing environment and ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the increase in wolves means competition for food is rising. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, which means hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and increase my chances of survival in a challenging environment where resources are limited.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of securing food without overexerting myself in a competitive situation. This balance helps ensure my survival while being mindful of the dwindling resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of securing food while still being cautious, as overexerting myself could lead to competition with other wolves for the limited resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the wolf population is also declining. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and increase my chances of survival while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and the number of wolves has decreased significantly. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of catching enough food while still being cautious, as overhunting could lead to further depletion of resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high with a recent decline in their population. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can secure enough food without overexerting myself. A moderate increase in intensity allows me to be more competitive while still conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With fewer wolves, a lower intensity can help me conserve energy while still allowing for successful hunts. This balance increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to wasted energy and increased competition with other wolves. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a more competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while avoiding overexertion that could lead to exhaustion or injury. This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity while still being cautious.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low, and the competition among wolves has increased with their recent decrease. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition is less intense, allowing me to hunt at a moderate intensity without risking overexertion or attracting unwanted attention from other wolves. A theta of 0.50 balances the need for food with the need to conserve energy and stay cautious.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the wolf population, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves for limited resources. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid drawing attention, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, and the wolf population has decreased. This suggests that there may be less competition for food, allowing me to hunt at a moderate intensity without risking overexertion. A theta of 0.50 balances the need for food with the need to conserve energy, ensuring my survival in this changing environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition for food is becoming more intense. With fewer wolves, I can afford to hunt with a higher intensity to secure food while still being mindful of the sheep population. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting, but the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition is lower. By lowering my intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still taking advantage of the available prey, ensuring my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, and the wolf population has decreased significantly. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.65, I can take advantage of the current situation where there are fewer competitors while still being cautious, as the overall number of wolves is still high.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, which presents a good opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests competition is fierce. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the available prey while still being cautious about the risks posed by other wolves.",

However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition is less intense, allowing me to hunt with a higher intensity without risking overexertion. A theta of 0.75 balances the need for food with the caution of not exhausting myself too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, which means competition for food is still present.
