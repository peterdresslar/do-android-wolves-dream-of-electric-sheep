This balance helps ensure my survival without overexploiting the resource.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting more challenging. However, the increase in wolves suggests competition for food is rising. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity, I can better compete for resources while still conserving energy for future hunts.",

By increasing my intensity slightly from 0.65 to 0.75, I can improve my chances of a successful hunt while still conserving energy for future needs. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, which means food is becoming scarcer. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
