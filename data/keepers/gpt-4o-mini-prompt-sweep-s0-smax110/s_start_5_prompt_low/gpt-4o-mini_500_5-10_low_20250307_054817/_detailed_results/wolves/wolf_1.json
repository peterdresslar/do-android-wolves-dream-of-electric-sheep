By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid drawing attention to myself. This strategy allows me to survive longer in a challenging environment where resources are limited.",

By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion and competition from other wolves. This way, I can ensure my survival while still contributing to the pack's success."
