            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts. This strategy helps ensure my survival by avoiding competition with other wolves for scarce resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and less food for me. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and wait for a better opportunity.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population means competition for food is rising. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can balance my energy expenditure with the need to secure food while avoiding overexertion in a potentially scarce environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With an increase in the wolf population, competition for food will be higher. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of securing enough food while still being mindful of the risks associated with overexertion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and failure. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting more challenging. With an increase in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food without exhausting myself. A slightly higher intensity than my previous choice allows me to adapt to the current situation while still being cautious.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with the increase in wolves, competition for food will be fierce. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with the wolf population remaining constant, I need to increase my hunting intensity to ensure I can secure enough food for survival. A theta of 0.60 allows me to be more aggressive in my hunting while still conserving some energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts, as the wolf population is rising and competition will be fierce.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, indicating that hunting may be less fruitful. By lowering my intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, allowing me to adapt to the current situation and increase my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making them harder to catch. With fewer sheep and a declining wolf population, a lower hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being opportunistic. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion. This approach allows me to be more strategic in my hunting, ensuring I can still survive while not depleting resources too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the number of wolves, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves for the same prey. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's survival. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and increases my chances of survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and I need to balance my energy expenditure with the need to secure food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can contribute to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is increasing. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's survival. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the declining wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion. This way, I can still contribute to my survival while being mindful of the dwindling resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively low, and the number of wolves has decreased significantly. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises."
