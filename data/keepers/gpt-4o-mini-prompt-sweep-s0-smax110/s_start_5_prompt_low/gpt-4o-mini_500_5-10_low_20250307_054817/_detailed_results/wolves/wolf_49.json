            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making them a scarcer resource. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential failure. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, adapting to the current situation.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests that competition for food is rising. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can balance the need to hunt effectively while conserving energy for future hunts, especially as the sheep population has decreased. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a more competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential failure. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food without exhausting myself. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With fewer sheep, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and reduce competition with other wolves, allowing me to survive longer while waiting for better conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while still conserving energy. This approach allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself, which is crucial for survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with the wolf population also declining, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to overexploitation of the remaining sheep. A lower intensity allows for a more sustainable approach, ensuring I can survive longer without depleting resources too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion and competition from other wolves. This moderate approach allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the wolf population is still high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves for limited prey. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",

This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the current situation while still being cautious.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively low, and the number of wolves has decreased significantly. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, allowing me to survive longer while waiting for a better opportunity to hunt.",
