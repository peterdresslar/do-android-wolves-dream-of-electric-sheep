            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high compared to the increased number of wolves. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance may help ensure my survival in a more competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, competition for food is higher, so a lower intensity will help conserve energy while still allowing for opportunistic hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, while the wolf population has increased. A moderate hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still taking advantage of the available prey. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, competition for food is high, and a lower intensity will help conserve energy while still allowing me to hunt effectively. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the increase in wolves means competition for food is higher. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still being effective in securing food, balancing the risk of overexertion with the need to survive.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the increase in wolves means competition for food is higher. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. By adjusting my intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, allowing me to adapt to the changing environment and ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making them a scarcer resource. With more wolves around, I need to increase my hunting intensity to ensure I can secure enough food for survival. A theta of 0.70 balances the need for increased effort while still conserving some energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and reduce competition for dwindling resources. This balanced approach increases my chances of survival while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can strike a balance between securing enough food for survival while not overexerting myself in a competitive situation where other wolves are also hunting. This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity and ensure I have enough energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, indicating a scarcity of food. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also struggling. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation while still being able to hunt effectively when conditions improve.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while avoiding overexertion that could lead to depletion of resources.
