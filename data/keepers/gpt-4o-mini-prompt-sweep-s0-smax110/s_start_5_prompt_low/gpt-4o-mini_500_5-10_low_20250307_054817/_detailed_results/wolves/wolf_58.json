            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, which means food is scarcer. With more wolves around, I need to increase my hunting intensity to compete effectively for the limited resources. A theta of 0.75 allows me to hunt more aggressively while still conserving some energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and avoid competition while still allowing for some hunting success.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and reduce competition for the remaining sheep. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with the number of wolves remaining the same, competition for food will be fierce. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of successfully hunting while still conserving energy, as the sheep are fewer and I need to be strategic about my efforts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high with their numbers also declining. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",

By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the wolf population is also declining. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.40, I can better compete for the limited resources while still conserving energy. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high due to their recent decline. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can better ensure my survival while still being mindful of the limited prey available. This balance allows me to hunt effectively without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high with a recent decline in their population. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity may lead to competition with other wolves for limited resources. By increasing my intensity slightly to 0.60, I can improve my chances of a successful hunt while still conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high with a recent decline in their numbers. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to wasted energy and increased competition with other wolves. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a more competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still conserving energy, as the sheep population is low. This approach allows me to adapt to the current situation and increase my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",

            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, and the wolf population has decreased. This suggests that there may be more opportunities for hunting without overwhelming competition. A moderate intensity allows me to balance the need for food while conserving energy and avoiding unnecessary risks."
