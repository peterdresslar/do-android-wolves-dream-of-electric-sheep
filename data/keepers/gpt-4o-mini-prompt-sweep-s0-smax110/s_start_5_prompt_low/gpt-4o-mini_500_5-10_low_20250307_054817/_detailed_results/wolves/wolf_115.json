            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. By lowering my intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also hunting at maximum intensity. This balanced approach helps ensure my survival while still allowing for successful hunts when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making it harder to find food. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and less food for me. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and wait for a better opportunity when the sheep population stabilizes or increases.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This balance allows me to adapt to the changing environment and increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and the number of wolves is still high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while conserving energy and avoiding overexertion, which is crucial for my survival in a declining population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still allowing for a chance to catch prey. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while avoiding overexertion that could lead to depletion of resources. This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the current situation and increases my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure enough food while conserving energy, as the overall wolf population has also decreased. This approach allows me to adapt to the current environment and increase my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can strike a balance between ensuring I get enough food while also conserving energy and avoiding overexertion in a dwindling prey situation. This way, I can adapt to the current scarcity and improve my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. With fewer sheep available and a decrease in the wolf population, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy while still allowing for a chance to hunt effectively without competing too aggressively with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the wolf population is also declining. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still being cautious about overexerting myself in a competitive environment. This way, I can secure enough resources without risking too much energy or attracting unwanted attention from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the number of wolves, and hunting at a higher intensity will increase my chances of securing food. However, I need to be cautious, as other wolves are also competing for the same resources. A theta of 0.70 balances the need for food with the risk of overexertion.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises."
