            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased recently, which means competition for food is higher. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively when necessary. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a more crowded environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 15 wolves competing for food, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexerting myself while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased slightly, and with the number of wolves remaining constant, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I have enough energy for future hunts while still being competitive. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy and adapt to the fluctuating prey availability.",

By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively when necessary.
