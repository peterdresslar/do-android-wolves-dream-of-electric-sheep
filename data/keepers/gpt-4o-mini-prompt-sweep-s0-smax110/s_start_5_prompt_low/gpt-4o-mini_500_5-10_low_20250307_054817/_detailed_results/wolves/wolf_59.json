            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts. This balance increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a less favorable environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, which means hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. By increasing my intensity slightly from my previous theta, I can take advantage of the current situation while still being cautious, as the number of wolves remains high.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can take advantage of the available prey while still being cautious, as overexerting myself at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves and potential exhaustion.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competing directly with other wolves for dwindling resources. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and increase my chances of survival in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high with their numbers also declining. A lower hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still being cautious, as overexertion could lead to competition with other wolves. This moderate approach helps ensure my survival without risking too much energy.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively low, and with fewer wolves around, I can afford to hunt at a lower intensity. This will help conserve energy and resources while still allowing me to contribute to the pack's survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low, and the competition among wolves is high due to their recent decrease. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still increasing my chances of catching prey without overexerting myself or risking injury in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts, especially with the declining wolf population. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging situation.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high due to their recent decline. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the wolf population is also declining. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to catch enough food to survive.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting more challenging. By increasing my intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexerting myself, especially with the recent decline in the wolf population. This way, I can still contribute to the pack's survival while being cautious.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. With the wolf population decreasing, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This strategy helps ensure my survival by balancing the need for food with the risk of competition."
