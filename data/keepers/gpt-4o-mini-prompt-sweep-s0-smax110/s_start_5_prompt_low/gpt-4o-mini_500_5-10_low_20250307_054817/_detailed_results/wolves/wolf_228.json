            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to hunt effectively while conserving energy for future hunts, especially with an increasing number of wolves competing for the same resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can maximize my chances of catching enough food while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival as the competition among wolves remains constant.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This balance helps ensure my survival in a changing environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my intensity to 0.70, I can enhance my chances of a successful hunt while still conserving energy for future needs. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with the number of wolves remaining the same, competition for food will be high. By lowering my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the hunt. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and increase my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can improve my chances of successfully hunting while still conserving energy compared to maximum intensity. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.5, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively low compared to the number of wolves, indicating competition for food is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, with the number of wolves decreasing, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough prey while conserving energy for future hunts. A theta of 0.40 allows me to be more efficient without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I aim to balance the need for food while still conserving energy, as the competition among wolves is high. This way, I can maximize my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests competition is fierce. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can take advantage of the abundant prey while still being cautious of the risks posed by other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a more cautious approach. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival while still contributing to the pack's needs.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, but the wolf population has decreased. This suggests that competition for food is less intense, allowing me to hunt with lower intensity while still being effective. A theta of 0.45 balances the need to conserve energy and avoid overexertion, ensuring my survival in a changing environment.",
