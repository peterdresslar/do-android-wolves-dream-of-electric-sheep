By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.20, I can conserve energy and avoid overexerting myself while still contributing to the pack's efforts. This strategy allows me to survive longer in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food will be higher. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can better secure food while still conserving energy, as the sheep population is relatively stable.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the wolf population, which means there is enough food to sustain a moderate hunting intensity. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can still contribute to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased slightly, but the wolf population has increased. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.65, I can take advantage of the current situation while still being cautious. This allows me to balance the need for food with the risk of competition from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making them scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and less food for everyone. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt, ensuring my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at a higher intensity will increase my chances of catching prey before others do. However, I don't want to exhaust myself completely, so a theta of 0.70 balances my need for food with the risk of overexertion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential failure. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting more competitive. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a changing environment.",

By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can maximize my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment with increasing wolf numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting more challenging. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy and avoid competition while still allowing for opportunistic hunting. This balance increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making them a scarcer resource. With the increase in the wolf population, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves and a higher risk of failure. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and wait for a better opportunity when the sheep population stabilizes or increases.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting may be less fruitful. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive in the hunt, especially since the number of wolves remains the same. This balance increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves than sheep, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",

This approach allows me to adapt to the changing environment without overexerting myself.",

By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and I need to balance my energy expenditure with the need to hunt effectively. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's survival, especially given the recent decrease in both sheep and wolves.",
