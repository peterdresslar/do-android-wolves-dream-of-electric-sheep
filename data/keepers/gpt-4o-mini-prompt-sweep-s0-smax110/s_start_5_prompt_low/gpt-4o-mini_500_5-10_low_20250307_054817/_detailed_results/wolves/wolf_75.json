This balance allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and avoid overexertion, which is crucial for my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the wolf population is still high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competing too aggressively with other wolves for limited resources. This strategy may help ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",

By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while conserving energy and avoiding competition with other wolves. This moderate approach helps ensure my survival in a dwindling resource situation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively low, and the number of wolves has decreased significantly.

A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a more competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still being cautious, as overexerting myself could lead to exhaustion or injury. This way, I can adapt to the changing dynamics and ensure my survival.",
