            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting more challenging. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. This way, I can adapt to the current conditions and increase my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population means competition for food is rising. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's efforts. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a potentially scarce food environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, I need to increase my hunting intensity to compete effectively for the limited resources. A theta of 0.70 allows me to balance the need for food while not overexerting myself, as I still need to conserve energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, while the wolf population has increased. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves for the dwindling sheep. This balanced approach allows me to adapt to the current situation while still contributing to my survival.",

A theta of 0.70 allows me to balance the need for food while not overexerting myself in a potentially risky environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting at maximum intensity less viable. With more wolves around, competition for food is increasing, and a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the increase in the wolf population means competition for food is higher. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still being effective in securing food, balancing the need to survive with the risk of overexertion in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexerting myself in a situation where food is scarce. This strategy allows me to survive longer while waiting for better opportunities.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion, ensuring I have enough energy to survive while still contributing to the pack",
