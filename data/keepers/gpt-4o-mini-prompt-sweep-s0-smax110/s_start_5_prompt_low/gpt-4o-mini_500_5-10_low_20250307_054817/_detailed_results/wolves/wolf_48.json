            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, which means hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can still contribute to my survival while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep. This balance is crucial as the wolf population is increasing, and competition for food will be higher.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting more challenging. With more wolves around, a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive in the hunt. This balance increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, I need to increase my hunting intensity to compete effectively for the limited resources. A theta of 0.65 allows me to balance the need for food while not overexerting myself, as I still need to conserve energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy while still allowing me to hunt effectively. This balance increases my chances of survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting more challenging. By increasing my intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of catching enough food while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with many wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the overall population of wolves is still high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves for limited prey. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high with their population also declining. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the increased competition.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while being cautious not to overexert myself in a dwindling population of prey and competitors. This approach allows for sustainable hunting without risking my survival.",

By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a more competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while conserving energy, as the sheep population is low. This approach allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics and improve my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",

            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion, especially since the wolf population has also decreased. This strategy allows me to be more efficient in hunting while conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the competition among wolves is high with fewer resources available. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competing directly with other wolves for the remaining sheep.
