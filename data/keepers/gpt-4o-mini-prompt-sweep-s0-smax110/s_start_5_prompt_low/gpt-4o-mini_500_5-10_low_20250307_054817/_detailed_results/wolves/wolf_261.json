By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival, especially with the current wolf population remaining stable.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making hunting less fruitful. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy while still being able to hunt if the opportunity arises. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and increases my chances of survival without competing too aggressively with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is high.
