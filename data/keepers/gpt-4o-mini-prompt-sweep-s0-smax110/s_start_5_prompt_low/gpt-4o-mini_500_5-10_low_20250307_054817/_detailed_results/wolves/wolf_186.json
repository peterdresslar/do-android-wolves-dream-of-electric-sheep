            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and less food for everyone. By increasing my intensity slightly, I can balance the need for food while avoiding drawing too much attention from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making food scarcer. With an increase in the wolf population, competition for food is higher. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.65, I can improve my chances of catching enough food while still being cautious not to overexert myself and risk injury or exhaustion.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. With an increase in the wolf population, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and overexploitation of the remaining sheep. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid drawing attention while still contributing to the hunt when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. With an increase in the wolf population, competition for food will be higher. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of securing food while still being cautious not to overexert myself in a potentially risky environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the increase in the wolf population means competition for food is higher. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexerting myself in a situation where prey is scarce. This strategy allows me to survive longer while waiting for better opportunities.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential failure. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid direct competition while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion. This way, I can still hunt effectively while conserving energy for survival, especially with the increasing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making them scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and failure to secure a meal. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and wait for a better opportunity when the sheep population stabilizes or increases.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion, ensuring I have enough energy to survive while still being competitive with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, which means food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can maximize my chances of catching enough prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that food is becoming scarcer.

This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",

A moderate intensity allows me to be efficient while still conserving energy.",

            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a more competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can better secure food while still conserving energy, as the sheep population is not high. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
