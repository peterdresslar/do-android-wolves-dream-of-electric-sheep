            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting more competitive. By reducing my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves while still being able to catch enough food. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting more challenging. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts. This balance increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making hunting more competitive among wolves. By increasing my intensity to 0.75, I can improve my chances of successfully hunting while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a changing environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and reduce competition for the remaining sheep. This way, I can still hunt effectively without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion without a guarantee of success. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still participating in hunts. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the declining wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while being cautious not to overexert myself, as the competition among wolves is still high. This way, I can ensure my survival without risking too much energy.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the declining wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while being cautious not to overexert myself, which could lead to exhaustion or danger from other wolves. This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the current situation and ensure my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the overall population of wolves is also declining. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, ensuring my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with more wolves around, competition for food is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid drawing attention to myself while still being able to hunt if necessary. This cautious approach increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment.

            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overhunting, which could further deplete the sheep population and threaten my survival in the long run.",
