With more wolves around, I need to increase my hunting intensity to compete effectively for the limited resources. A theta of 0.70 allows me to balance the need for food while not overexerting myself, as the sheep population is still relatively low.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, I need to conserve energy and avoid competition for dwindling resources. A moderate intensity allows me to hunt effectively while minimizing risk.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, which means food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting more challenging. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. This strategy increases my chances of survival by avoiding competition with other wolves for limited prey.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With fewer sheep available, a lower intensity will conserve energy and reduce competition with other wolves, allowing me to adapt to the current situation while still being able to hunt effectively if opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high with their numbers also declining. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion, while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, and the number of wolves is also declining.

By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.40, I can take advantage of the current situation without overexerting myself, ensuring I have enough energy for future hunts while still contributing to the pack's survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts, considering the overall decline in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, and with fewer sheep, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to wasted energy and increased competition with other wolves. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",

By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also struggling. This way, I can ensure my survival while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in the wolf population suggests increased competition for food. By raising my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of successfully hunting sheep while still conserving some energy. This balance is crucial for my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively low, and with more wolves than sheep, hunting at full intensity could lead to competition with other wolves for the limited prey. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition, increasing my chances of survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests competition is fierce. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can take advantage of the sheep while still being cautious, as I need to ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
