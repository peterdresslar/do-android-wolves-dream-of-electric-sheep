            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and reduce competition for the remaining sheep. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, competition for food is higher, so a lower intensity will help me conserve energy while still allowing for opportunistic hunting when necessary.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, which means competition for food is increasing among wolves. By raising my hunting intensity to 0.65, I can improve my chances of successfully hunting while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a changing environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making them a scarcer resource. With an increase in the wolf population, competition for food will be higher. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can maximize my chances of securing food while still being mindful of energy conservation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, which means food is becoming scarcer. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation while still being able to hunt effectively when necessary.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting more competitive among wolves. By increasing my intensity to 0.75, I can improve my chances of successfully hunting while still conserving some energy for future hunts.

            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and reduce competition for the remaining sheep. This balanced approach increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and the number of wolves is still high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still contributing to the pack's survival. This cautious approach allows me to adapt to the current situation and increase my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion. This way, I can still contribute to my survival while being mindful of the dwindling resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, indicating a scarcity of food. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, who are also struggling. This strategy allows me to survive longer until the sheep population recovers.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still being cautious. This allows me to take advantage of the available sheep without overexerting myself, considering the declining wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the overall population of wolves is also declining. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and increase my chances of survival while waiting for the sheep population to recover. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while conserving energy, as the sheep population is low. This approach allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself, ensuring my survival."
