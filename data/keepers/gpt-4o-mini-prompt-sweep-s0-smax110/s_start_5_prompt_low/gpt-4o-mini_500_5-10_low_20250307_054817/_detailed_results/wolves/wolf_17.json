            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population means more competition for the same number of sheep. By reducing my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the hunt. This balance allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics and ensure my survival.",

            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population means more competition for food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of securing enough food while still being cautious not to overexert myself, as the sheep population hasn't changed. This balance helps ensure my survival in a growing pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population means more competition for the same number of sheep. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With an increase in the wolf population, competition for food will be higher. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can better ensure my survival while still being cautious not to overexert myself, as the risk of failure increases with higher intensity in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. However, the increase in the wolf population means competition is higher. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can improve my chances of securing food without exhausting myself too quickly, balancing the need for survival with the risks of overexertion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting more challenging. With an increase in the wolf population, competition for food is higher. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's efforts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a tougher environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, which means food is scarcer. With more wolves around, I need to increase my hunting intensity to ensure I can secure enough food for survival. A theta of 0.75 allows me to be competitive without exhausting myself too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.5, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still participating in the hunt. This balance allows me to adapt to the current situation and ensure my survival without risking depletion of resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy and avoid competition while still allowing for opportunistic hunting if the chance arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, which means food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to hunt effectively while conserving energy, as the competition with other wolves remains high. This approach allows me to adapt to the changing environment and ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, indicating a scarcity of food. With fewer sheep available, hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable, and I need to conserve energy for survival. A lower intensity allows me to hunt more strategically while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still increasing my chances of catching prey. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a challenging environment."
