            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population means competition for food is rising. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.30, I can improve my chances of securing enough food while still conserving energy compared to the maximum intensity. This balance helps ensure my survival in a growing pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, I need to balance my hunting intensity to avoid competition while still ensuring I can catch enough prey. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With an increase in the wolf population, competition for food will be higher. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of successfully catching prey while still conserving some energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential failure. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can better secure my share of the dwindling sheep population while still conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt, ensuring my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with the number of wolves remaining the same, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still find enough food without overexerting myself. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and the number of wolves is still high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves for dwindling resources. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolf populations indicates a need for a more balanced approach to hunting. By increasing my intensity to 0.50, I can contribute to securing food while also being cautious not to overhunt, which could lead to further declines in the sheep population and ultimately threaten my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the wolf population is still high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still contributing to the pack's survival. A lower theta allows for a more strategic approach to hunting in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can strike a balance between conserving energy and increasing my chances of securing food, which is crucial for my survival amidst the declining population."
