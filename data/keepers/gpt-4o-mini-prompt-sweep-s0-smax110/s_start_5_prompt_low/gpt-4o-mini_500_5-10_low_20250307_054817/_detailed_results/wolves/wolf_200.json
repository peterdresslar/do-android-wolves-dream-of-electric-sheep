            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexerting myself while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. By setting theta to 0.60, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overhunting, which could lead to competition with other wolves. This approach helps ensure my survival while still contributing to the pack's success.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. By increasing my intensity to 0.75, I can take advantage of the larger prey while still conserving energy for future hunts, ensuring my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are likely to hunt at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to ensure my survival while still contributing to the pack's overall success.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and still have a chance to catch prey without overexerting myself. This balance helps ensure my survival while still contributing to the pack's success.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, which means there is enough prey to sustain a moderate hunting intensity. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of securing food while still being cautious about overexerting myself, given the rising wolf population.",
