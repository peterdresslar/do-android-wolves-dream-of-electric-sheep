However, with the wolf population decreasing, I want to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still secure food without overexerting myself and risking injury or exhaustion. A moderate intensity allows me to be efficient while also considering the dynamics of the pack.",

However, with the recent decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still compete effectively without overexerting myself. A theta of 0.75 allows me to hunt efficiently while being mindful of the risks.",
