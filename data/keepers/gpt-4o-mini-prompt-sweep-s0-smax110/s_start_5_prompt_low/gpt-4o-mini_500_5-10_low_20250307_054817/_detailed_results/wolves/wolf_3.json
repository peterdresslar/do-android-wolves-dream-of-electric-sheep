            "I chose this theta because with 10 wolves and only 5 sheep, the competition for food is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid attracting unnecessary attention from other wolves. This strategy allows me to survive longer without overexerting myself in a scarce environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance the need for food with the risk of overexerting myself. A moderate intensity allows me to hunt effectively while conserving energy for future hunts, especially as the sheep population has increased slightly.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high, and the wolf population has decreased. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still taking advantage of the available prey. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, with the decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still secure food without overexerting myself or risking confrontation with other wolves. A moderate intensity allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics while still being effective."
