            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means food is becoming scarcer. With an increase in the wolf population, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and overhunting. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and still have a chance to catch prey without exhausting the remaining sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and the number of wolves has increased. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with the increase in the wolf population, competition for food will be fierce.
