            "I chose this theta because with the increase in both sheep and wolves, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves for the same prey. By choosing a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt, ensuring I have enough resources for survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because with a stable number of wolves and an increase in sheep, it\u2019s wise to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. A lower intensity allows me to be strategic and avoid competition with other wolves who may be hunting at maximum intensity. This way, I can ensure my survival while still contributing to the pack's success.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 10 wolves, competition for food is moderate. A theta of 0.50 allows me to balance between conserving energy and increasing my chances of a successful hunt without overexerting myself. This way, I can adapt to the situation while still being effective.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.65, I can improve my chances of catching enough food while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a growing pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting. By increasing my intensity slightly from 0.65 to 0.75, I can take advantage of the higher sheep numbers while still being cautious, as the wolf population remains stable. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, which suggests that hunting at full intensity might lead to competition with other wolves. By reducing my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. By raising my intensity slightly from 0.65 to 0.75, I can take advantage of the higher prey availability while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By lowering my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By raising my hunting intensity slightly, I can better secure my share of the sheep while still being mindful of energy conservation. This balance helps ensure my survival in a growing pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By reducing my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's efforts.

This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and with the recent increase in wolves, hunting at a slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. This way, I can avoid overexertion and ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and with 16 wolves competing for food, a slightly increased hunting intensity will improve my chances of securing a meal without overexerting myself.
