            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, competition for food is high, so a moderate intensity will help conserve energy while still allowing for a chance to catch prey.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting more challenging. By increasing my intensity to 0.70, I can maximize my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the increase in the wolf population means competition for food is higher. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still participating in hunts. This strategy allows me to survive longer in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting more challenging. With more wolves around, competition for food is high, and a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts. This strategy increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is increasing. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still being effective in securing food. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while conserving energy for future hunts, ensuring my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, indicating that food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can maximize my chances of securing enough food while still being mindful of the dwindling sheep population. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high due to their recent decline. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and increase my chances of survival while still participating in the hunt. This balanced approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to wasted energy and increased competition with other wolves. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while conserving energy. This approach allows me to adapt to the changing conditions without overexerting myself, which is crucial for survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and the number of wolves has decreased significantly. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival until the prey population recovers.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while conserving energy, as the sheep population is low. This approach allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself, which could be detrimental given the recent decline in wolf numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the declining wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the number of wolves, and hunting at a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive. This balance increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself in a dwindling prey situation.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low, and the wolf population has decreased significantly.
