            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting more challenging. With the increase in the wolf population, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making it harder to find food. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and be strategic in my hunting, waiting for the right moment to strike when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and failure. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, balancing my needs with the current situation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a competitive environment where resources are becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while conserving energy, as hunting at maximum intensity may lead to overexertion and increased risk of failure. This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics and improve my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a more competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while conserving energy, as the sheep population is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is low and the competition among wolves is high. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid drawing attention to myself, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to wasted energy and increased competition with other wolves. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the number of wolves, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves for limited resources. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid unnecessary risks while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while being cautious not to overexert myself in a dwindling population of prey. This approach allows me to adapt to the current situation and increase my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer sheep available, hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and increase my chances of survival while still contributing to the pack's needs. This approach allows me to adapt to the current situation and avoid overexertion.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting more challenging. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion, ensuring I have enough energy to survive while still contributing to the pack",
