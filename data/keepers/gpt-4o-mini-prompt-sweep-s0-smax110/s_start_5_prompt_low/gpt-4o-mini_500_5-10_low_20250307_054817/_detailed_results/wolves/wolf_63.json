            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With an increase in the wolf population, competition for food will be fierce. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts, increasing my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making them scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and less food for all. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, which means hunting is becoming more challenging. By increasing my intensity slightly to 0.65, I can maximize my chances of catching enough food while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with many wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high with their population also declining. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and increase my chances of survival while still contributing to the pack's needs without overexerting myself in a scarce environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, I need to increase my hunting intensity to secure enough food for survival. However, I must be cautious, as the overall wolf population is also declining, which means competition for food is high. A theta of 0.60 allows me to balance the need for food while not overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the wolf population is also declining. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and increase my chances of survival in a challenging environment. A lower theta allows me to be more strategic and avoid competition with other wolves for dwindling resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high due to their recent decline. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can better position myself to secure enough food while still being cautious not to overexert myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer sheep available, hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and increase my chances of survival in a competitive environment where other wolves are also struggling.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively low, and the number of wolves has decreased significantly. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. By increasing my intensity from 0.30 to 0.50, I can balance the need to hunt effectively while conserving energy for future hunts, ensuring my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low, and the recent decrease in both sheep and wolves suggests that competition for food is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still having a chance to catch prey. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.45, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy. This balance is crucial for my survival, especially with fewer sheep available and competition from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With fewer sheep available, a lower intensity will conserve energy and reduce competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition is less intense, allowing me to hunt at a moderate intensity without risking overexertion or attracting too much attention from other wolves. A theta of 0.50 balances the need to secure food while conserving energy.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the wolf population, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to overexertion and competition with other wolves. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid drawing attention while still contributing to the pack's survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, providing a better opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself.
