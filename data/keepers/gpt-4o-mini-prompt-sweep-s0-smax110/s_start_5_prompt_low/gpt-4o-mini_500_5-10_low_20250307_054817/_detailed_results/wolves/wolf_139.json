            "I chose this theta because with the increase in both sheep and wolves, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to overexploitation of resources and competition with other wolves. A slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high compared to the wolf population. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the growing sheep population while still being cautious, as the increase in wolves means competition for food is rising.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased significantly, which means competition for food is higher. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population means more competition for the available sheep. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can better secure food while still conserving energy, as the sheep population is relatively stable. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy while still allowing for some hunting opportunities. This balance increases my chances of survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and less chance of a successful hunt. By increasing my intensity slightly to 0.60, I can balance the need for food while being cautious of the increased wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because with the increase in the wolf population, competition for food is rising. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can better secure my share of the dwindling sheep population while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance will help ensure my survival in a more competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy and avoid competition while still allowing for some hunting success.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, which means food is scarcer. With more wolves around, I need to increase my hunting intensity to compete effectively for the limited resources. A theta of 0.75 allows me to balance the need for food while conserving some energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the increase in the wolf population means competition for food is higher. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This strategy allows me to adapt to the changing environment and increases my chances of survival.",

By increasing my intensity from 0.40 to 0.60, I can take advantage of the current situation without overexploiting the remaining sheep, ensuring my survival while being mindful of the overall balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting more challenging. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can maximize my chances of securing food while still conserving energy, as the competition among wolves is rising.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, indicating that hunting may be less fruitful.
