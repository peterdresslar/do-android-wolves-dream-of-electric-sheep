            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the increase in wolves means competition for food is rising. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's efforts, ensuring I have enough resources to survive without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making them more scarce. With an increase in the wolf population, competition for food is higher. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving some energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with an increase in the wolf population, competition for food will be higher. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still participating in hunts. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and increases my chances of survival in a more competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making hunting more competitive among wolves. By increasing my intensity to 0.75, I can maximize my chances of securing food while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival as the wolf population is increasing.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making them a scarcer resource. With more wolves around, hunting at full intensity may lead to competition and exhaustion. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, competition for food is high, and a lower intensity will help conserve energy while still allowing for opportunistic hunting. This balance increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, I need to be more strategic in my hunting. Increasing my intensity to 0.60 allows me to be more effective in catching food while still conserving energy for future hunts, especially since the wolf population is still high and competition is fierce.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, indicating a scarcity of food. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also struggling. This approach may help me survive longer until the sheep population recovers.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, indicating a scarcity of food. With fewer sheep available, hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable and could lead to overexertion without sufficient reward. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves suggests that resources are becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still conserving energy, as hunting at maximum intensity may lead to competition with other wolves. This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the changing environment and increases my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and increase my chances of survival while waiting for better opportunities to hunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while avoiding overexertion that could lead to depletion of resources. This approach allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics and ensure my survival without risking too much energy.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the competition among wolves is high.
