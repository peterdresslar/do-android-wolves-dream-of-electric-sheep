            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, indicating a tougher hunting environment. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity may lead to competition and exhaustion. A slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting more challenging. With an increase in the wolf population, competition for food is higher. By reducing my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being effective in hunting. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and reduce competition for the remaining sheep. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation while still ensuring my survival.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less predictable. By increasing my intensity slightly from my previous theta of 0.40 to 0.50, I can adapt to the changing environment and improve my chances of a successful hunt while still conserving energy for future needs.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, which means food is scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can improve my chances of successfully catching prey while still conserving energy. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with increasing wolf numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, which means food is becoming scarcer. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy while still being active enough to catch prey when opportunities arise. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With fewer sheep, it's wise to conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also hunting at maximum intensity. A lower theta allows me to adapt to the current situation while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the wolf population is also declining. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also struggling. This strategy may help me survive longer until the situation improves.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while conserving energy, as the sheep population is still relatively high. This approach allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the number of wolves, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves for the same prey. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's survival. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the competition among wolves is high. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while conserving energy, as I still need to be cautious of the dwindling sheep population and the aggressive hunting of other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high, and I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure my survival while also considering the decreased number of wolves. By increasing my intensity to 0.75, I can take advantage of the available prey without overexerting myself, which could lead to exhaustion or injury.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a more competitive environment. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.5, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's survival. This balance allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the declining wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and with more wolves than sheep, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves for limited resources. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in the wolf population suggests increased competition for food. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to hunt effectively while conserving energy and avoiding overexertion, which is crucial for my survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is low, and the wolf population has decreased. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests competition is fierce. By choosing a moderate intensity, I can balance the need to hunt effectively while conserving energy and avoiding overexertion in a challenging environment.",
