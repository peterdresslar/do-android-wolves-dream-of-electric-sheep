            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, which means there is less food available. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to survive longer while waiting for the sheep population to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By raising my hunting intensity slightly, I can better secure my share of the dwindling sheep population while still being mindful of the risks involved in overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with an increase in the wolf population, competition for food will be higher. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, which means food is scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can maximize my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival as the competition among wolves is rising.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making it less likely to find enough food if I hunt at maximum intensity. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and increase my chances of survival while still participating in the hunt. This balance allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, and the number of wolves is still high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves for limited prey. This strategy allows me to survive longer while waiting for conditions to improve.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion and depletion of resources. This way, I can still hunt effectively while conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high with their population also declining. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the increased competition.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolf populations indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while conserving energy and avoiding overexertion. This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity while still being competitive with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low, and the wolf population has decreased significantly. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and reduce competition with other wolves, while still being able to catch enough food to survive.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the wolf population is also declining. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while conserving energy and avoiding overexertion. This approach allows me to adapt to the changing environment and increases my chances of survival without competing too aggressively with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With fewer sheep, I need to conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, who are also struggling. A lower intensity allows me to remain agile and ready for better opportunities in the future.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves for limited resources. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting.",
