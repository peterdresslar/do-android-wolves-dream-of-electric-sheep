            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and I want to ensure I can still secure enough food while avoiding overexertion. A slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and adapt to the increasing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased slightly, and the wolf population has increased. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the wolf population has increased. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, I need to increase my hunting intensity to ensure I can secure enough food for survival. A theta of 0.60 balances the need for increased effort while still conserving some energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and less food for me. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating that hunting may be more challenging. However, with the recent increase in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still secure food while avoiding overexertion. A moderate intensity of 0.60 allows me to be more efficient in my hunting without risking depletion of resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential failure. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and adapt to the current situation while still being able to hunt effectively.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting more competitive. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can better secure food while still conserving energy, as the wolf population is rising. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the increase in wolves means competition for food is higher. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with the increase in the wolf population, competition for food will be higher. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of successfully hunting while still conserving some energy for future hunts, ensuring my survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and the increase in wolves means competition for food is higher. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of catching enough food while still conserving energy. This balance is crucial for my survival, especially with the wolf population remaining stable.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can maximize my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival as the competition with other wolves remains high.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating less food availability. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",

            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, which means hunting is becoming more competitive. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts, given the declining wolf population. This balance is crucial for my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the wolf population is also declining. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are likely hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can take advantage of the available prey while still conserving energy and avoiding overexertion, which is crucial given the recent decline in the wolf population.",
