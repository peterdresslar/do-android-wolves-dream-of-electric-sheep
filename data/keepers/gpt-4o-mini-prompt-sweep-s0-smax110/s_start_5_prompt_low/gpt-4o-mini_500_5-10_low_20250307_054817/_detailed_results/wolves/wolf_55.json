            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough prey without exhausting myself. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive in the hunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential failure. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and adapt to the changing environment while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, which means food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to hunt effectively while conserving energy for future hunts, as the competition among wolves is increasing.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less viable at maximum intensity. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the sheep population stabilizes or increases.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while conserving energy. This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the declining wolf population, ensuring my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the declining wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high with their numbers also declining. A moderate hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, balancing the need for food with the risk of overexertion in a dwindling prey environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid unnecessary risks while still being able to hunt when opportunities arise.

            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to wasted energy and increased competition with other wolves. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's survival.",
