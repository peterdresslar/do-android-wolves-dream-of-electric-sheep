            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased significantly, which means competition for food is higher. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a crowded environment.",

However, with the number of wolves remaining the same, I need to balance my hunting intensity to avoid overexertion and ensure I can still compete with others. A theta of 0.45 allows me to increase my chances of a successful hunt while conserving energy for future opportunities.",
