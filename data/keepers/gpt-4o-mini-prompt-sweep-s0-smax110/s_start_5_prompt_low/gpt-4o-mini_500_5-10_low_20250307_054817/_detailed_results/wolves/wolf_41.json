            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and less food for everyone. By increasing my intensity slightly, I can balance the need for food while avoiding overexertion and competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with an increase in the wolf population, competition for food will be higher. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of successfully hunting while still conserving some energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and reduce competition for food. This balance allows me to survive while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can better secure my share of the dwindling sheep population while still conserving some energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with an increase in the wolf population, competition for food will be higher. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's hunting efforts. This balance may help ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With fewer sheep, a lower intensity reduces the risk of overexertion and allows me to conserve energy for future hunts. Additionally, with the wolf population remaining stable, competition for the remaining sheep will be fierce, so a more cautious approach seems wise.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a more competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still conserving energy, as hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable given the current population dynamics.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid drawing attention while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the declining wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the wolf population is also declining. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still increasing my chances of catching enough food to survive. This balance helps ensure I don",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is low, and the wolf population has decreased significantly. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while conserving energy and avoiding overexertion. This approach allows me to adapt to the changing conditions and increases my chances of survival without risking too much in a potentially scarce food situation.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the number of wolves, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves for the same prey. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and reduce the risk of failure while still contributing to the pack's survival."
