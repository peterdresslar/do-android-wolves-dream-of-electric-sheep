            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting more competitive among wolves. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of securing food while still being mindful of the risk of overexertion in a dwindling prey environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can better compete for food while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves competing for the same prey, a lower hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts. This strategy increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy, as the competition among wolves remains constant. This balance helps ensure my survival in a changing environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's efforts. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of securing food while still being cautious, as overexerting myself could lead to exhaustion or danger from competing wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the competition among wolves is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's survival. This approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the declining wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can better secure food while still conserving energy, as the sheep population is low. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a dwindling prey situation.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and I need to increase my hunting intensity to secure enough food for survival. However, I must be cautious not to overexert myself, as the recent decrease in the wolf population indicates competition for resources is increasing.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the wolf population is still high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves for limited resources. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
