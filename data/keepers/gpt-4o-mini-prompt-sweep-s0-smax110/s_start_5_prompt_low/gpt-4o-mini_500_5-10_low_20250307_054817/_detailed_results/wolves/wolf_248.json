            "I chose this theta because with the increase in the wolf population, competition for food is rising. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success. This strategy allows me to survive longer in a challenging environment where resources are becoming scarcer.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 14 wolves competing for food, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to balance the risk of overexertion with the need to secure enough food for survival. This approach also considers the recent trend of stable wolf numbers, suggesting that a more cautious strategy may be beneficial.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, which gives me a good opportunity to hunt successfully without overexerting myself. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can take advantage of the current situation while still conserving some energy for future hunts, ensuring my survival in a competitive environment.",
