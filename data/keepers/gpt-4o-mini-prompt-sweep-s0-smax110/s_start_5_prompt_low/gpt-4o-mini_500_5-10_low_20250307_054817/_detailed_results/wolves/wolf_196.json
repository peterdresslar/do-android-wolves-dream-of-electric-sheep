By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can improve my chances of catching enough food while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a changing environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, indicating a scarcity of food. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. This approach allows me to adapt to the current situation and avoid overexertion, which is crucial for my survival as resources are limited.",
