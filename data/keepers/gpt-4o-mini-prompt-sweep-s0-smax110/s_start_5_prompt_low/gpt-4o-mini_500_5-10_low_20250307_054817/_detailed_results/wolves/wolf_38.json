            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and risk injury. A slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts. This way, I can avoid competition with other wolves and increase my chances of survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can better secure my share of the dwindling sheep population while still being cautious not to overexert myself, given the recent decrease in sheep numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and reduce competition for the remaining prey. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation while still ensuring my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population decreasing and the number of wolves remaining the same, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still secure enough food while not overexerting myself. A moderate intensity of 0.50 allows me to adapt to the changing environment and increases my chances of survival without risking depletion of resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolf populations suggests a more competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of securing food while still being cautious, as overexerting myself could lead to exhaustion or injury in a dwindling population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high due to their recent decline. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is low and the competition among wolves has increased due to their recent decrease. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid unnecessary risks while still contributing to the pack"
