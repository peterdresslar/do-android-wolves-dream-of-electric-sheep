By increasing my intensity to 0.75, I can take advantage of the higher number of sheep while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, which means competition for food is increasing. By reducing my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. By increasing my intensity slightly from 0.65 to 0.75, I can take advantage of the larger prey population while still conserving energy and avoiding overexertion. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the increase in the wolf population, competition for food is likely to intensify. Lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60 allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, ensuring I can survive longer without overexerting myself in a potentially scarce environment."
