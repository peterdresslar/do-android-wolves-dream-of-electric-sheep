By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still being cautious, as overexerting myself could lead to unnecessary risks given the declining prey and competition.",

By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's survival. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the declining wolf population.",
