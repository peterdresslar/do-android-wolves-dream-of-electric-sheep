            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at full intensity could lead to competition and less food for everyone. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting at maximum intensity less viable. With more wolves competing for the same food source, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid attracting attention from other wolves while still contributing to the hunt. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a more competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, I need to increase my hunting intensity to ensure I can secure enough food for survival. However, I don't want to overexert myself and risk injury, so a moderate increase to 0.60 balances the need for food with the risk of competition.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, which means competition for food is higher among wolves. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can better secure my share of the dwindling resources while still being cautious not to overexert myself, given the increased wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making them scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, ensuring my survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with the number of wolves remaining the same, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still find enough food without overexerting myself. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive in the hunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, indicating a scarcity of food. With fewer sheep available, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to wasted energy and increased competition with other wolves. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and increase my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can better compete for food while still conserving energy compared to maximum intensity. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a declining prey situation.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the wolf population is still high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while conserving energy, as the competition among wolves is still high. This approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the declining wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment."
