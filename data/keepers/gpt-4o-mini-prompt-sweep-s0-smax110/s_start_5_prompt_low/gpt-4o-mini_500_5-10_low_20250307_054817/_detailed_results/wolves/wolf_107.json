            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. However, the wolf population has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly to 0.55, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and the number of wolves has increased. A lower hunting intensity will help me conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves for the dwindling sheep. This strategy allows me to survive longer while waiting for a better opportunity.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making them a scarcer resource. With more wolves around, I need to increase my hunting intensity to compete effectively for food while still being cautious not to overexert myself and risk injury.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can improve my chances of successfully catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with increasing wolf numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy while still allowing for some hunting opportunities. This balance increases my chances of survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, competition for food is high, so a lower intensity will help conserve energy and reduce the risk of overexertion. This way, I can wait for a better opportunity to hunt when the conditions are more favorable.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while conserving energy, as the competition among wolves is still high. This approach allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself.",

            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion and competition with other wolves. This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the current situation while still being cautious.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to wasted energy and increased competition with other wolves. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion, allowing me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting.",
