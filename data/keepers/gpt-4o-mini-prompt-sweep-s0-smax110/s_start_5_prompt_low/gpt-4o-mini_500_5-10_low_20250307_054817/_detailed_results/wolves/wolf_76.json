            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, which means food is scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at full intensity could lead to competition and potential failure. A slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with the number of wolves remaining the same, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to overexploitation of the remaining sheep. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and wait for a better opportunity when the sheep population stabilizes or increases.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and the number of wolves is still high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves for limited prey. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still being cautious, as overhunting could lead to further depletion of resources and increased competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the wolf population is still high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a tougher environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still conserving energy. This approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the declining wolf population, ensuring my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, especially since the overall wolf population has also decreased. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",

This approach allows me to adapt to the changing circumstances and improve my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With fewer sheep and a declining wolf population, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts. This strategy increases my chances of survival by avoiding overexertion in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high with a recent decline in their numbers. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still increasing my chances of securing food without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively low, and with a decrease in the number of wolves, competition for food is likely to be high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and increase my chances of survival.",
