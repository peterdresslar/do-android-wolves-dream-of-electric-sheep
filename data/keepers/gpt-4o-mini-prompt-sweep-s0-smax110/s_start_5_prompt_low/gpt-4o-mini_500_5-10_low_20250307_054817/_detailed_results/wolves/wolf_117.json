            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting more challenging. With the increase in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food without exhausting myself. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, which means hunting may be less successful at maximum intensity. By increasing my theta slightly, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexerting myself and competing with other wolves. This way, I can still hunt effectively while conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting at maximum intensity less sustainable. With more wolves competing for fewer sheep, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being part of the hunt. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a more competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of successfully catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with increasing wolf numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is increasing. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolf populations indicates a challenging environment. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.30, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still being cautious. This allows me to adapt to the declining prey availability without overexerting myself, which could lead to unnecessary risks.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also struggling. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still conserving energy, as the sheep population is low. This approach allows me to adapt to the changing conditions without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still conserving energy. This approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of resources and avoid overexertion, which could lead to vulnerability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively low, and the number of wolves has decreased significantly. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and increase my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still conserving energy and avoiding overexertion. This approach allows me to adapt to the current situation and ensure my survival without competing too aggressively with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and with fewer prey available, a lower hunting intensity will help conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation while still having a chance to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the number of wolves, and hunting at a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive.

            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests competition is still high.
