            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the wolf population has increased. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.25, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still contributing to the hunt when opportunities arise. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.40, I can better secure my share of the dwindling sheep population while still conserving energy compared to maximum intensity. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the wolf population has increased. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves for the remaining sheep. This strategy allows me to survive longer while waiting for a more favorable hunting opportunity.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting more challenging. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion, especially with more wolves around competing for the same resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making hunting more competitive. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can better secure food while still conserving energy, as the recent increase in wolves suggests that competition will be fierce. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food less abundant. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, competition for food is high, and a lower intensity will help conserve energy while still allowing for opportunistic hunting. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion. This approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity while still being cautious, ensuring my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the recent decrease in both sheep and wolf populations indicates a scarcity of resources. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competing directly with other wolves for limited prey. This strategy may help ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can better compete for food while still conserving energy, allowing me to adapt to the fluctuating prey availability and the competition from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, indicating a scarcity of food. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who may be hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to survive longer in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while conserving energy. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself, as the sheep population is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the competition among wolves is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
