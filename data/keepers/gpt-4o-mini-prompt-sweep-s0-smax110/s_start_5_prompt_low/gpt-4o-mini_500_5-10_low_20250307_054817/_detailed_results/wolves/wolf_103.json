With more wolves around, hunting at full intensity could lead to competition and less food for everyone. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid unnecessary confrontations with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the increase in wolves means competition for food is higher. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting at maximum intensity less viable. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid competition while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and while the wolf population has increased, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food without overexerting myself. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting at maximum intensity less viable. With more wolves competing for fewer sheep, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid direct competition while still contributing to the pack's overall success.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting more competitive among wolves. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still being effective in securing food. This balance allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself, given the increased wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and the number of wolves is still high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still contributing to the pack's survival. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while being cautious not to overexert myself, as the competition among wolves is still present. This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the current situation and ensure my survival.",

A moderate approach allows me to adapt to the changing environment without overexerting myself.",
