            "I chose this theta because with 10 wolves and only 5 sheep, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves and potential exhaustion. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct confrontation, increasing my chances of survival in a scarce environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, and the wolf population has decreased. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can balance the need for food while also conserving energy and avoiding competition with other wolves. This approach increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, indicating a good opportunity for hunting. However, with the recent decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can secure enough food while also conserving energy for future hunts. A theta of 0.70 allows me to be more aggressive than before without overexerting myself."
