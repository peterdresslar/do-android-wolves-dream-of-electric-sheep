This strategy increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",

            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is low and the wolf population has decreased significantly. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still contributing to the pack's survival. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the increased risk from fewer resources.",

This way, I can still hunt effectively while conserving energy for survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer sheep available, hunting at maximum intensity may lead to wasted energy and increased competition with other wolves. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting. However, with the recent decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food while also conserving energy for future hunts. A theta of 0.70 allows me to be more aggressive than before while still being cautious.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with fewer wolves around, a moderate hunting intensity will allow me to secure enough food while conserving energy. This balance increases my chances of survival in a fluctuating environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with the number of wolves remaining constant, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively. This approach reduces competition with other wolves and increases my chances of survival in the long run."
