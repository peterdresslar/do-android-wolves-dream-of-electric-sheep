By raising my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can better secure my share of the dwindling sheep population while still conserving energy compared to maximum intensity. This balance will help ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my intensity slightly from my previous theta of 0.60, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival as the competition among wolves remains constant.",
            "I chose this theta because with the increase in the wolf population, competition for food is rising. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the hunt. This strategy allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics and increases my chances of survival in a more competitive environment.",
