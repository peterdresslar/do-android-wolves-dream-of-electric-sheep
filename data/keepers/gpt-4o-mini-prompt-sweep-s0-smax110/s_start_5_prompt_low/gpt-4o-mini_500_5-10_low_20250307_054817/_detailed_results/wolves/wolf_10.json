By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.40, I can take advantage of the situation without overexerting myself, ensuring I remain healthy and capable of competing with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because with a stable number of wolves and an increase in sheep, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can secure enough food without exhausting myself or overhunting. A moderate increase in intensity allows me to adapt to the current situation while still being mindful of my energy reserves.",
            "I chose this theta because with an increase in the number of wolves, competition for food is rising. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can better secure enough food for myself while still being mindful of the need to conserve energy for future hunts. This balance will help ensure my survival in a growing pack.",
            "I chose this theta because with the increase in the number of wolves, competition for food has intensified. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.5, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance allows me to survive longer in a more competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with an increase in the number of wolves, competition for food will be higher. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves while still contributing to the pack's overall success. This strategy allows me to survive longer in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with an increase in the number of wolves, competition for food will be higher.

            "I chose this theta because the increase in the number of wolves means competition for food is rising.

This balance helps ensure my survival in a more competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population means more competition for the same number of sheep. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",

            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves.

This strategy increases my chances of survival in a crowded environment.",

This way, I can still secure enough resources without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding.
