By raising my intensity slightly, I can capitalize on the increased wolf population while still being cautious.",

            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the wolf population is still high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the population of sheep is decreasing, and the number of wolves is also declining. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who may be hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to survive longer while waiting for a more favorable situation.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolf populations suggests that resources are becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can better compete for food while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balanced approach helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the number of wolves, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves for the same prey. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid drawing attention, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises."
