            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and less food for me. By choosing a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt, allowing me to adapt to the changing environment and ensure my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and overexertion without a guarantee of success. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive in securing food. This balance increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With an increase in the wolf population, competition for food will be higher. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of securing a meal while still conserving some energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, indicating that hunting may be less successful. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, allowing me to adapt to the changing environment and avoid overexertion in a potentially scarce food situation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with an increase in the wolf population, competition for food will be higher. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my intensity slightly from 0.40 to 0.50, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balanced approach helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, indicating a scarcity of food.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to survive longer while waiting for better conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and I need to balance my energy expenditure with the need to secure food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving some energy for future hunts, especially given the recent decline in both sheep and wolf populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's survival. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the declining wolf population.",
