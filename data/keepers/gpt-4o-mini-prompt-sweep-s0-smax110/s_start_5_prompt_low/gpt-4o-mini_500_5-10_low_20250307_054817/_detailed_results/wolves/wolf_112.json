            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and the increase in wolves means competition for food is higher. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting more challenging. By adjusting my intensity to 0.5, I can conserve energy while still being competitive in the hunt. This balance allows me to adapt to the changing environment and increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and avoid competition while still allowing for some hunting success.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the increase in wolf population means competition for food is higher. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a potentially scarce environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential failure. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid unnecessary confrontations while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is increasing. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to hunt effectively while conserving energy and resources for future hunts. This approach allows me to adapt to the changing environment and increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, indicating a scarcity of food. With fewer sheep available, hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable and could lead to exhaustion or failure. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.30, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while conserving energy and avoiding overexertion. This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity and increases my chances of survival without competing too aggressively with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's survival. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the declining wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves suggests a more competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while conserving energy, as the sheep population is still relatively low. This approach allows me to adapt to the changing conditions without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting more competitive among wolves. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment.
