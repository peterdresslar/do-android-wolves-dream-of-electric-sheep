            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With an increase in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough prey without exhausting myself or risking failure. A slightly higher intensity than before allows me to be more competitive while still being mindful of the risks.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, which means food is scarcer. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and reduce competition for the remaining sheep. This strategy allows me to survive longer while waiting for better opportunities.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and reduce competition for the remaining sheep. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity while still being prepared to hunt if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is increasing. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of securing food without overexerting myself, which is crucial for my survival in a declining population.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolf populations indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I aim to secure enough food while still being cautious, as overexerting myself could lead to exhaustion or danger from competing wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can better compete for resources while still conserving some energy. This balance may help ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a dwindling prey situation.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high with their numbers also declining. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the increased competition.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the competition among wolves is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves for the remaining sheep. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while conserving energy, as the sheep population is low and hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. This approach allows me to adapt to the current situation and increase my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with the wolf population also declining, it\u2019s crucial to conserve energy and avoid overexertion. A lower hunting intensity allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey while still participating in hunts when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment.

By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the number of wolves, and the recent decrease in wolf population suggests competition is high. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's efforts, increasing my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
