            "I chose this theta because with an increase in the number of wolves, competition for food will be higher. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey without overexerting myself, which is crucial for survival in a more competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population means more competition for the available sheep. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.5, I can balance the need to secure food while conserving energy and avoiding overexertion. This way, I can adapt to the changing dynamics without risking starvation or attracting too much attention from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased significantly, which means competition for food is higher. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively when necessary. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with an increase in the wolf population, competition for food will be higher. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly to 0.40, I can improve my chances of securing food without overexerting myself, which is crucial for survival given the current circumstances.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population means competition for food is rising. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can secure more resources while still conserving some energy. This balance helps ensure my survival in a more competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the increase in the wolf population, competition for food will be higher. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and ensure my survival without risking depletion of resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With an increase in the wolf population, competition for food is higher. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to hunt effectively while conserving energy for future hunts, ensuring my survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, I need to increase my hunting intensity to compete effectively for food while still being cautious not to overexert myself, as the sheep population is low.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By raising my hunting intensity slightly, I can better secure my share of the dwindling sheep population while still being mindful of the risks involved in overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, which means hunting might be less successful. By lowering my intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy while still being active enough to catch prey if the opportunity arises. This also allows me to adapt to the increased number of wolves, reducing competition for food.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and avoid competition while still allowing for opportunistic hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can better compete with the other wolves for the limited resources while still conserving some energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can improve my chances of catching enough food while still conserving energy for future hunts, as the overall wolf population remains high.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a more competitive environment. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack"
