            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 15 wolves competing for food, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to balance the need for sustenance while minimizing the risk of overexertion. This way, I can conserve energy and increase my chances of survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because with the increase in the wolf population, competition for food is likely to intensify. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. By increasing my intensity to 0.70, I can take advantage of the higher prey availability while still conserving energy compared to maximum intensity. This balance helps ensure my survival while being mindful of the competition from other wolves.",
