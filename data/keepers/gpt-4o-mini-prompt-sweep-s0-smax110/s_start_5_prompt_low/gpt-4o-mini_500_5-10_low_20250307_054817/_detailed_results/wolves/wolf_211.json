            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion, especially since the wolf population is increasing. This moderate intensity allows me to adapt to the current situation while still being cautious.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased slightly, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.65, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival, especially with the number of wolves remaining constant.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making them a more valuable resource. With an increase in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still secure enough food while avoiding overexertion. A slightly higher intensity than my previous choice allows me to be competitive without risking depletion of my energy reserves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.6, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the hunt. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my intensity to 0.75, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival as the competition among wolves remains constant.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By lowering my intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy while still being active enough to catch prey if the opportunity arises. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a challenging situation.",
