            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and less food for everyone. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making it less likely to find enough food at maximum intensity. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting more challenging. By adjusting my intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still being competitive in the hunt. This balance allows me to adapt to the changing environment and increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making them a scarcer resource. With more wolves present, I need to increase my hunting intensity to secure enough food for survival. A theta of 0.70 strikes a balance between conserving energy and increasing my chances of a successful hunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with more wolves around, competition for food is increasing. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid drawing attention while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while conserving energy. This approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the competition from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the declining wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still being cautious, as overexerting myself could lead to competition with other wolves. This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the current situation and ensure my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and the number of wolves is still high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves for limited prey, ensuring my survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is low and the competition among wolves is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid drawing attention to myself, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of securing food while still conserving energy, as the overall population of sheep is low. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, and the number of wolves is still high. A moderate hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a scarcity of food. With fewer sheep available, a lower hunting intensity will help conserve energy and increase my chances of survival in a competitive environment where other wolves are also hunting at maximum intensity. This way, I can adapt to the current situation and wait for a better opportunity."
