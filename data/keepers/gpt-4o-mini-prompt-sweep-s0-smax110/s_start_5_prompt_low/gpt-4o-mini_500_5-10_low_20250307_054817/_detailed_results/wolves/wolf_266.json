            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, which means there is enough food available. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the situation without overexerting myself, allowing for a sustainable approach to hunting while still ensuring my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still being effective in securing food. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 15 wolves competing for food, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still having a chance to hunt successfully. This approach balances my need for survival with the competition from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success. This strategy allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics and ensure my survival in a more sustainable way.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased slightly, which presents a better opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. By increasing my intensity from 0.30 to 0.45, I can balance the need to hunt effectively while conserving energy, especially since the number of wolves remains the same. This way, I can still compete for food while being mindful of my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased significantly, which means competition for food is higher. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and increases my chances of survival in a competitive environment."
