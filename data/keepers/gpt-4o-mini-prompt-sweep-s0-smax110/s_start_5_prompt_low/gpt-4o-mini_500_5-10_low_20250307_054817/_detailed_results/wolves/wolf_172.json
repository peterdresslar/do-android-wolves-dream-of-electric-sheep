This way, I can ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher.

This way, I can adapt to the changing dynamics and ensure my survival without exhausting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid competition while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting more challenging. With an increase in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food without exhausting myself. A moderate increase in theta allows me to be more competitive while conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means food is becoming scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and overexploitation of the remaining sheep. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid drawing attention while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. With more wolves around, I need to balance my energy expenditure and increase my chances of catching prey without overexerting myself.
