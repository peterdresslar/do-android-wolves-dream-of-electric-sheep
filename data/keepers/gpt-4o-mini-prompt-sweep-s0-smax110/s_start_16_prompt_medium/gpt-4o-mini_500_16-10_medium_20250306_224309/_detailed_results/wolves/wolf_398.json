However, with the wolf population at 69, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both populations can thrive. A moderate increase to 0.50 allows for some hunting while still promoting coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.36, which is only 23.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is an opportunity to hunt, I need to be cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still giving sheep a chance to recover. This balance is crucial for the long-term survival of both species.",

This will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.85, which is only 9.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover.

A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
