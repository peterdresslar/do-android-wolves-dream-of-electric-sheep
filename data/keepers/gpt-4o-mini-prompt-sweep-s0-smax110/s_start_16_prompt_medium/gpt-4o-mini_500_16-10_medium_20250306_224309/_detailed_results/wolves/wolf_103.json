            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 119\n- Sheep population: 12.54\n- Wolf population: 39.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.350\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.32 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 11.4% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is close to its maximum capacity, and my previous theta was very low. A gradual increase to 0.25 allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach balances the needs of both wolves and sheep, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 88% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is necessary to maintain balance and avoid over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 76.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.62, it is essential to maintain a balance to prevent overhunting and ensure the long-term survival of both species. A slight increase in theta allows for more hunting while still being cautious about the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual increase is necessary to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly, as we need to consider long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 50.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With the wolf population at 65.00, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is relatively low at 0.85. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling wolves to maintain a healthy population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of making gradual adjustments to ensure long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must also be cautious not to deplete the sheep too quickly. A gradual increase allows for a balanced approach, ensuring both populations can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.87, which is only 29.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to ensure our own survival. A theta of 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for some hunting without depleting the sheep further, while also considering the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.96, which is only 23.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some reproduction among wolves while still enabling the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.79, which is only 18.9% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, allowing for sustainable coexistence while still addressing the needs of the wolf pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.38, which is only 15.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support our wolf population without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.29, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain my pack while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.60, which is only 12.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.54, which is only 11.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves."
