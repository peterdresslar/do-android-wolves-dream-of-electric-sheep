            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that they can sustain some hunting pressure. However, with the wolf population also being relatively stable, a moderate increase in hunting intensity will help ensure our reproduction while allowing for some recovery in the sheep population. This approach balances our immediate needs with the long-term health of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and while I need to maintain hunting to support wolf reproduction, I must also be cautious to prevent depleting the sheep population. A moderate theta allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at its maximum capacity, indicating that we should be cautious with our hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta value will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A slight decrease from my previous theta will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population remains sustainable.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 84.3% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, as it allows for sustainable coexistence without depleting the sheep population too quickly. Additionally, with the current wolf population, a slight reduction in hunting intensity will help prevent overcompetition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 80.30, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while ensuring that we do not over-deplete their numbers. This adjustment reflects a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction without jeopardizing the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain the balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring both can thrive without depleting resources too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 45.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 34.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.54, I need to be cautious about hunting too aggressively to avoid depleting the sheep population. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow for a more sustainable balance while still enabling the wolf population to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 29.08, which is only 26.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover rather than intensifying hunting. A moderate theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance, allowing for some hunting while prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.28, which is only 21.2% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.35 helps maintain balance and allows for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.07, which is only 17.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is some opportunity for hunting, it is crucial to maintain a balance to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.50, which is only 15.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to help sustain our wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need to adapt to the changing conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.23, which is only 12.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 balances the need for wolf survival with the necessity of not depleting the sheep population further."
