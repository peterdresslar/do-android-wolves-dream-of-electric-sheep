            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 70% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep. This allows for a moderate increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still ensuring that the sheep population can recover. A gradual adjustment helps maintain balance and avoids over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term survival of both species. This adjustment reflects the need to balance the growing wolf population with the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but I need to be cautious as the wolf population is relatively high. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain our population while allowing the sheep to recover gradually. This approach aligns with the wisdom of making small adjustments to ensure long-term balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the wolf population is relatively high. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain their numbers. This approach aligns with the wisdom of making gradual adjustments to ensure long-term balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.44, which is only 24.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.23, which is only 18.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is some opportunity for hunting, it is crucial to allow the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity and give the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, while also managing competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.96, which is only 15.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support our wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting sustainability while still considering the need for wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.36, which is only 13.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting a theta of 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This gradual adjustment helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",

This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population, ensuring long-term sustainability for both wolves and sheep.",

This indicates that there is a need for cautious hunting to allow the sheep to recover while still ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach that supports both species without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.38, which is only 9.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking the depletion of the sheep population, promoting a more sustainable balance.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.90, which is only 9.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover rather than intensifying our hunting. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of both populations.
