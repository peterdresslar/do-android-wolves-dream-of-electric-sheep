This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still giving sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently healthy at 16.81, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level (16.0% of maximum capacity), and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are still enough sheep to sustain moderate hunting. By setting theta at 0.45, I can maintain a balanced approach that allows for some hunting while also considering the need for the sheep population to recover. This gradual adjustment helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",

A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help ensure that both populations can thrive in the long term.",

A moderate increase allows for a balance that supports both populations.",

This moderate adjustment will help maintain both wolf and sheep populations without risking depletion.",

This adjustment reflects a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the long-term health of the sheep population.",
