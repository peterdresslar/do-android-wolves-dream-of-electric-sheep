            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. A gradual approach will help maintain balance without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 3.67, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. A moderate approach allows for sustainable coexistence while giving sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment helps avoid overhunting and supports the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a gradual increase in hunting intensity while ensuring that the sheep can recover. This moderate approach helps maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and hunting, promoting the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 93.30, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 79.78, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are more sheep than wolves. This suggests that I can afford to reduce my hunting intensity slightly to allow for the sheep population to recover while still competing with other wolves. A gradual adjustment helps maintain balance and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, supporting our long-term survival while still being cautious of the wolf population growth.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 46.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.75, the wolves are competing for resources, so a slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. This moderate approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still considering the need to maintain a balance with the sheep population. A gradual increase is prudent to avoid over-depletion of sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 28.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 68, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.10, which is only 22.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is an opportunity to hunt, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population, ensuring a sustainable balance between both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.82, which is only 18.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.83, which is only 16.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase to 0.45 allows for some hunting while still considering the need for sheep recovery and the overall balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.50, which is only 14.1% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, allowing for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.87, which is only 12.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting while prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both populations."
