            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 470\n- Sheep population: 12.02\n- Wolf population: 40.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.300\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.30 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 10.9% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that a slight increase in hunting intensity is appropriate to ensure our survival and reproduction. However, I must remain cautious and avoid drastic changes, as the wolf population is still relatively low. A moderate increase allows for sustainable coexistence while keeping an eye on both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, I must remain cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep. A gradual increase will help maintain balance while allowing for some growth in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still healthy at 97.35, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 45.00, I must remain cautious to avoid over-depleting the sheep. A gradual increase to 0.45 reflects a balanced approach that supports both reproduction and sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of my ancestors, promoting a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and my previous theta of 0.55 was slightly aggressive. A small reduction to 0.50 allows for continued hunting while giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring a balanced ecosystem as both populations fluctuate.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 49.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 68, which is relatively high, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach that supports both sheep recovery and wolf population stability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 41.82, which is only 38.0% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help balance the ecosystem and prevent over-depletion of the sheep, while still allowing for some hunting to support wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level relative to its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderate to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta will help sustain my pack while still being mindful of the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.33, which is only 23.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to allow the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity, allowing for a more sustainable balance between both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.32, which is only 18.5% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help me maintain a balance between hunting and allowing the sheep to grow, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.62, which is only 15.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased gradually, it is important to remain cautious and not over-deplete the sheep. A moderate increase to 0.45 allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.54, which is only 13.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a lower hunting intensity is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring a gradual balance that promotes the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.90, which is only 11.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.02, which is only 10.9% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability without depleting the sheep further."
