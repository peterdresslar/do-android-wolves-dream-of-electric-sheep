            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 187\n- Sheep population: 10.93\n- Wolf population: 37.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.350\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.30 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 9.9% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 93.7% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking over-depletion. This adjustment will help sustain our wolf population while still considering the long-term health of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 91.68, allowing for some increased hunting intensity without risking depletion. However, I must remain cautious as the wolf population is stable, and a gradual approach will help maintain balance and avoid sudden crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 70% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with the wolf population also being significant, a moderate approach is necessary to avoid over-depleting the sheep while still allowing for some hunting to support wolf reproduction. This balance will help maintain both populations sustainably.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. This value helps maintain the sheep population while still enabling the wolf population to thrive. It reflects a cautious increase in hunting intensity, considering the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 42.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 70, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 31.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 71, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 24.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69.00, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for more hunting while still prioritizing the long-term balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.23, which is only 18.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I need to focus on hunting to ensure the survival of my pack, I must also be cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for more hunting while still considering the long-term balance of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.36, which is only 13.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is some potential for hunting, it is crucial to prioritize the recovery of the sheep population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.78, which is only 11.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for sustainable cycles.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.59, which suggests that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from the previous theta of 0.40 to 0.35, I can still maintain some hunting activity while prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both sheep and wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we need to be cautious in our hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support our population while still prioritizing the sustainability of the ecosystem."
