            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid over-depletion of the sheep and to adapt to the current dynamics of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 29.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting, which could lead to a crash in sheep numbers. A moderate increase in hunting intensity allows for a balance that supports both populations while adapting to the current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.36, which is only 23.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is some opportunity for hunting, it is important to avoid overexploitation. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, ensuring that both the sheep and wolf populations can stabilize and thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.32, which is only 18.5% of its maximum capacity. While I want to maintain a healthy wolf population, I also need to allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help ensure that the sheep can rebound while still allowing for some hunting to support the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.30, which is only 15.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for increased hunting without risking the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.72, which is only 13.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while maintaining a sustainable wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 will help us balance our competition with other wolves and our hunting efforts, ensuring that we do not deplete the sheep further while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.33, which is only 12.1% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure my pack can thrive, I must also allow the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between hunting and allowing sheep to replenish, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the wolf population is relatively high. A moderate hunting intensity allows for some hunting while giving sheep a chance to recover. This approach helps maintain balance and avoids over-depletion of sheep, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.62, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting without risking the depletion of the sheep. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach that supports wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.98, which is only 10.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack without depleting the sheep further, ensuring a balance that supports both populations in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.75, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting. This will help balance the populations and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.85, which is only 9.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity should be increased to support wolf reproduction, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for sustainable cycles.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.95, which is only 10.0% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still being cautious. By raising theta to 0.40, I can balance the need for sustenance with the goal of allowing the sheep population to recover, ensuring long-term survival for both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.03, which is only 10% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover.
