            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at its maximum capacity, indicating that they can sustain some level of hunting without immediate risk of depletion. However, with a relatively high wolf population, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A theta of 0.80 allows for increased hunting intensity while still considering the long-term balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and while I need to maintain hunting to support the wolf population, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A moderate hunting intensity will help balance both populations sustainably.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A balanced approach will help maintain the sheep population while ensuring the wolf population remains healthy.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution in hunting to prevent depleting their numbers. A lower theta allows for competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover and prevent overexploitation. This will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that considers both the current sheep population and the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while ensuring that we do not over-deplete their numbers. This moderate adjustment helps maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep, promoting the long-term survival of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 93.30, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 48.00, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 79.78, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while ensuring that the sheep can recover. This moderate adjustment helps maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep, promoting long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment reflects a balance between ensuring the wolf population can thrive while still allowing sheep to recover. A gradual increase is prudent given the current dynamics.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 46.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.75, it is essential to maintain a balance that allows both populations to thrive. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help ensure the sheep can recover while still allowing for some hunting to support the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term health of both populations. This adjustment reflects a balanced approach, acknowledging the need to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and while it is important to hunt to sustain our pack, I need to be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A slight decrease in hunting intensity allows for some recovery of the sheep while still enabling us to compete effectively with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.10, which is only 22.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate decrease in hunting intensity will help balance the ecosystem without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.82, which is only 18.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
