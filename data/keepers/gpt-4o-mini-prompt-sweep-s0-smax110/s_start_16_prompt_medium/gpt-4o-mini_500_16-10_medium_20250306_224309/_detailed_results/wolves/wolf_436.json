            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 470\n- Sheep population: 12.02\n- Wolf population: 40.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.300\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.30 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 10.9% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. A lower theta allows for competition among wolves while giving the sheep a chance to recover, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is close to its maximum capacity, indicating a need for cautious hunting to prevent depletion. A moderate increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a balance as the wolf population grows, ensuring both species can thrive together.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep. This moderate adjustment will help sustain both populations without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 49.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for more hunting while still being cautious, as the wolf population is also significant. This approach supports both my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level (38.0% of maximum capacity), and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are not enough sheep to sustain aggressive hunting. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain its health. This approach aligns with the wisdom of making gradual adjustments to ensure long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity slightly to allow the sheep to recover while still competing with other wolves. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.33, which is only 23.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some reproduction among wolves while still giving sheep a chance to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without risking a rapid depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.32, which is only 18.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our wolf population without depleting the sheep further, promoting a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.62, which is only 15.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is potential for recovery if I reduce hunting intensity slightly. By increasing theta to 0.40, I can still maintain some hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.90, which is only 11.7% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure and promote a more sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.02, which is only 10.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting to support the wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep further."
