However, with the wolf population at 65, which is relatively high compared to the sheep, I need to be cautious not to overhunt. A moderate theta of 0.55 allows for a balanced approach that supports both sheep recovery and wolf population stability.",

With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.48, it is essential to maintain a balance that allows for sustainable coexistence. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help the sheep recover while still allowing for some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.96, which is only 23.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase to 0.45 allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.79, which is only 18.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover.

This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance."
