            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain our wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is key to avoiding sudden population crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep do not become depleted. A gradual adjustment is necessary to balance our needs with the ecosystem",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the sheep population at 49.3% of maximum capacity, I can maintain a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of making gradual changes and responding to the current state of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This balance helps maintain both populations without risking depletion or overcompetition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.52, which is only 29.6% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, allowing both populations to stabilize without over-depleting the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.36, which is only 23.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 allows for more hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious to avoid overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.32, which is only 18.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is potential for recovery in the sheep population. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep to gradually recover, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.30, which is only 15.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that supports both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.72, which is only 13.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for wolf survival with the necessity of allowing the sheep population to stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.33, which is only 12.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some reproduction among wolves while still giving sheep a chance to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting sustainability without risking a rapid depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.29, which is only 11.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is potential for recovery in the sheep population. By setting a theta of 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep to gradually recover, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.62, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking their rapid depletion. This adjustment helps maintain a balance, as the wolf population is relatively stable. A gradual increase in theta will support our reproduction while still allowing the sheep to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.98, which is only 10.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 strikes a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population has the opportunity to grow, thus supporting long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.75, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid sudden impacts on both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.85, which is only 9.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should be cautious with our hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 to 0.35 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for some hunting while still prioritizing the sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.95, which is only 10.0% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still being cautious.
