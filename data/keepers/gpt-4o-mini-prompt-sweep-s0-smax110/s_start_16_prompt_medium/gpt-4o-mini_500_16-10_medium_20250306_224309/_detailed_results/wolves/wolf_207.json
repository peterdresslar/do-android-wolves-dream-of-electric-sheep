            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 31.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with a wolf population of 71, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is low, suggesting that if I increase hunting intensity too much, it could lead to a rapid decline in sheep numbers. A theta of 0.3 allows for a cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still enabling some hunting to support our population without depleting the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.44, which is only 24.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A moderate increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.23, which is only 18.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting to maintain our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 strikes a balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep, promoting sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.96, which is only 15.4% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will enable me to maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.36, which is only 13.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population. This gradual adjustment helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.78, which is only 11.6% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a bit more hunting intensity, but still maintains a balanced approach to avoid depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.59, which is only 10.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population.
