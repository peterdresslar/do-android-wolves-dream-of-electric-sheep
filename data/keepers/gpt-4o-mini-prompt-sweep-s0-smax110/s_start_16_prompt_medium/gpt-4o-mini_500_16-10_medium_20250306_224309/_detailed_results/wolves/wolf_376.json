            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and a moderate hunting intensity will allow for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves. This approach balances the need for food with the health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 95.51, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This approach helps maintain a balance between the two populations and avoids depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, but I want to ensure that we do not overhunt and deplete their numbers too quickly. A slight reduction in hunting intensity allows for a more sustainable balance while still enabling the wolf population to thrive. This approach considers both the current sheep population and the need to maintain a healthy wolf pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment reflects the need to balance the growing wolf population while still ensuring the sheep can recover and thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 49.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 67, which is relatively high, I need to be cautious about over-hunting. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain a healthy population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover and thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 29.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 69, we need to be cautious about overhunting. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling us to compete effectively with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.36, which is only 23.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for more hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious about the sheep population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.32, which is only 18.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is some opportunity for hunting, it is crucial to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance, allowing for some hunting while also focusing on competition with other wolves, which is necessary given the current wolf population of 61. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.30, which is only 15.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach while still being mindful of the need to avoid overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.72, which is only 13.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need to compete with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to support the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the wolf population is relatively high. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help sustain our numbers while allowing the sheep population to recover gradually. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.29, which is only 11.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for sustenance with the long-term health of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.62, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking over-depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance as the sheep population recovers while also supporting the wolf population"
