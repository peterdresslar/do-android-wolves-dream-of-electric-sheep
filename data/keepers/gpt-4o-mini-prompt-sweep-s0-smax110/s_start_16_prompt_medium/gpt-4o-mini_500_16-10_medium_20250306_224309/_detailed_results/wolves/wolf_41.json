            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 94.4% of maximum capacity, allowing for some increased hunting intensity without risking immediate depletion. However, I want to be cautious and avoid overhunting, especially since the wolf population is also significant. A moderate increase in theta allows for sustainable coexistence while still promoting wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 93.30, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while ensuring that the sheep population remains sustainable. A gradual approach helps maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while I want to maintain a healthy wolf population, I also recognize the need to allow the sheep to recover slightly. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help balance our needs without risking a depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that can support wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This balance helps maintain the ecosystem",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 46.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.75, I need to be cautious about overhunting to ensure the long-term survival of both species. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still below half of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population being relatively high, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both populations can thrive. A gradual increase in theta will help maintain balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 28.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.46, I need to be cautious about hunting too aggressively to avoid depleting the sheep population. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.10, which is only 22.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for more hunting to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious to avoid overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.82, which is only 18.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to allow the sheep to recover, so I will focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intense hunting. A moderate theta will help maintain a balance while ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.83, which is only 16.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need to adapt to the changing conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.50, which is only 14.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I need to maintain some hunting to support wolf reproduction, I should not overhunt to allow the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 will help balance the needs of both species without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.87, which is only 12.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 strikes a balance between competing with other wolves and allowing the sheep population to stabilize, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.96, which is only 11.8% of its maximum capacity. While I need to focus on hunting to ensure the survival of my pack, I must also be cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for more hunting while still considering the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.21, which is only 11.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. By slightly decreasing my hunting efforts, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both the sheep and the wolf population, while avoiding sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem."
