            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. With a high sheep-to-wolf ratio, focusing on competition with other wolves will help maintain our population while giving the sheep a chance to rebound.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and hunting more aggressively could lead to depletion. A moderate approach will allow the sheep to recover while maintaining our wolf population sustainably.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 4.58, it is crucial to avoid overhunting, which could lead to a crash in the sheep population and ultimately harm the wolf population as well. Maintaining a lower theta will help ensure a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at its maximum capacity, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting more intensely could lead to a rapid decline in sheep numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition among wolves while giving the sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover and ensures a sustainable balance between our populations. It is crucial to avoid overhunting at this stage to prevent future crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and a slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain the balance without depleting the sheep too quickly. This adjustment allows for sustainable coexistence while also supporting the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is close to its maximum capacity, indicating that they can sustain a bit more hunting without significant depletion. However, the wolf population is relatively stable, so a moderate increase in hunting intensity allows for some growth in our numbers while still considering the long-term health of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while ensuring that we do not deplete their numbers too quickly. This adjustment supports our wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 78.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with the wolf population at 53.00, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 49.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep. However, the wolf population is relatively high at 68, which suggests that I should focus on competing with other wolves to prevent overhunting. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly, considering the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need for gradual changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 29.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.46, it is important to maintain a balanced approach to ensure the long-term survival of both species. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while still enabling the wolf population to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.33, which is only 23.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly."
