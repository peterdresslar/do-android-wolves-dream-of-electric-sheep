            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.00, which is only 14.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should maintain a moderate hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while still ensuring our wolf population remains healthy. A gradual approach will help us avoid depleting the sheep too quickly and allow for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep do not become overly depleted. A moderate increase aligns with the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and promotes coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep too quickly. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that considers the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need for both populations to thrive."
