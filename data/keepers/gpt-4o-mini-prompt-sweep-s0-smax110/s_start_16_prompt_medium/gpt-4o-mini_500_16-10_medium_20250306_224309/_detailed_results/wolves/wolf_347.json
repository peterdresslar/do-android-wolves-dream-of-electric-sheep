            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution in hunting to prevent depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the sustainability of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that we should reduce hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover and maintain a sustainable balance. This lower theta will help prevent over-depletion of the sheep while we focus on competing with other wolves, ensuring our long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery. Maintaining a lower theta will help prevent overexploitation of the sheep and ensure the long-term survival of both species. Additionally, with the wolf population already present, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at its maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in sheep numbers, jeopardizing the long-term survival of both species. Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover while we focus on competition among wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at its maximum capacity, and hunting them aggressively could lead to depletion. Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery. Maintaining a lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep while preventing overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. With a high sheep-to-wolf ratio, focusing on competition with other wolves will help stabilize the wolf population while giving sheep a chance to rebound.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population does not decline too rapidly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution in hunting to avoid depleting their numbers. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still focusing on competition with other wolves to maintain balance.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance while still considering the need to compete with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and a slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain the balance without depleting the sheep too quickly. This adjustment allows for sustainable coexistence while also supporting the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while still maintaining a sustainable balance with the sheep population. It\u2019s important to make gradual changes to avoid destabilizing the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 95.51, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are enough sheep to sustain the wolf population. However, to ensure long-term balance and avoid overhunting, a slight decrease in hunting intensity is prudent. This will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing sheep to recover. It",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 62.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. However, the wolf population is also significant, so a slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling us to compete effectively with other wolves. This moderate approach helps maintain a balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 49.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 67, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that supports both sheep recovery and wolf population health.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a balance as the wolf population grows, ensuring both species can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.52, which is only 29.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for more hunting to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious to avoid overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.36, which is only 23.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain our population while allowing the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.450 to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, prioritizing coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.32, which is only 18.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is some opportunity for hunting, it is crucial to prioritize the recovery of the sheep population to ensure long-term sustainability. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, helping to balance both populations."
