            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 471\n- Sheep population: 11.19\n- Wolf population: 35.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.400\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.32 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 10.2% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a gradual increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This value also reflects a cautious approach to competition with other wolves, ensuring that the wolf population remains stable while allowing sheep to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 78.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.62, it is essential to maintain a balance that allows for sustainable coexistence. A moderate increase from my previous theta of 0.25 will enable me to hunt more effectively while still allowing the sheep population to recover and ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will support wolf reproduction without overly depleting the sheep population, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover gradually.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and the wolf population is relatively high. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling wolves to maintain their numbers. This moderate approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.33, which is only 23.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I need to maintain a focus on hunting to support the wolf population, I should do so cautiously to allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease from my previous theta of 0.450 to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, ensuring that I do not over-deplete the sheep while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.32, which is only 18.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population while allowing sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.62, which is only 15.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is an opportunity to hunt, I need to be cautious and avoid overexploitation. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while giving sheep a chance to recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.54, which is only 13.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.90, which is only 11.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 will help balance the needs of both species without risking a crash in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.02, which is only 10.9% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will enable me to hunt a bit more effectively while still prioritizing the sustainability of both populations. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.19, which is only 10.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should be cautious with our hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 reflects a balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance."
