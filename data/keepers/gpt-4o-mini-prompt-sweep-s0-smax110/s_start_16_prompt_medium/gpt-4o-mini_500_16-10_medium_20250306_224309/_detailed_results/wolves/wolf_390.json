            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is necessary to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly, and this theta reflects a balanced approach.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that can support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. This balance will help maintain both populations over the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 49.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, since the wolf population is relatively high at 67, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to allow both populations to stabilize. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for some hunting while also focusing on competition with other wolves, promoting a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 38.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, focusing on coexistence while still enabling some hunting to support the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.52, which is only 29.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to allow for recovery. A moderate theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.36, which is only 23.1% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking the depletion of the sheep population. A moderate increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, enabling us to sustain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.32, which is only 18.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I need to maintain a focus on hunting to support wolf reproduction, I should do so cautiously to allow the sheep population to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 strikes a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.30, which is only 15.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.72, which is only 13.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.33, which is only 12.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.29, which is only 11.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to allow the sheep population to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.62, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking over-depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.98, which is only 10.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing our wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.75, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.85, which is only 9.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderate to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling my pack to thrive. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will help balance the need for hunting with the sustainability of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.95, which is only 10.0% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A gradual increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach to ensure both species can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.03, which is only 10% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a focus on competition with other wolves, a moderate theta value of 0.35 will help balance both populations. This gradual adjustment will support the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep."
