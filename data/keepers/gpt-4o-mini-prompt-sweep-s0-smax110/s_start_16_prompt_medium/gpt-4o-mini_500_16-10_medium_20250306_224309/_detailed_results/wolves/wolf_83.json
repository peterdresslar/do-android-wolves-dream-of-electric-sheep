            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover and prevent overexploitation. This lower theta value will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem while avoiding sudden changes that could destabilize it.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at its maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",

Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition with other wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be increased gradually to prevent overpopulation of sheep while still allowing for some recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that considers both the current high sheep numbers and the need to maintain a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep to recover, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and a slight increase in hunting intensity will allow for sustainable coexistence while still enabling the wolf population to thrive. This adjustment is small enough to avoid drastic impacts on the sheep, allowing them to recover while also supporting our pack",

However, with the wolf population at 52.00, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both populations can thrive. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow sheep to recover while still providing for our needs.",

However, given the current wolf population and the need to avoid over-depleting the sheep, a moderate adjustment is prudent to maintain balance and ensure long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 50.4% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly. Additionally, with the wolf population being relatively high, a moderate approach will help ensure sustainability.",

While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance and prevent over-depletion of the sheep, while still allowing for some hunting to support wolf reproduction.",
