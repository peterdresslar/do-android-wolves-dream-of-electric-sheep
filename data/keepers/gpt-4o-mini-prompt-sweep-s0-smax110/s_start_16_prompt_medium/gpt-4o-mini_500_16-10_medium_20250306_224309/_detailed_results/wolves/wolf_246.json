            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 258\n- Sheep population: 11.30\n- Wolf population: 33.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.350\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.34 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 10.3% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 84.3% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover if needed. A gradual adjustment is crucial to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help support wolf reproduction while still ensuring that the sheep population can sustain itself. A gradual adjustment is necessary to maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is key to avoiding overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity from the previous theta of 0.60, I can help ensure the sheep population has the opportunity to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of gradual changes and the need to adapt to the current state of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This approach balances the need for wolf reproduction with the health of the sheep population, ensuring long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 29.08, which is only 26.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a presence in the hunting cycle. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of both populations. It also helps to prevent overexploitation of the sheep, ensuring that we can continue to thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.28, which is only 21.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. By increasing theta slightly from 0.35 to 0.40, I can focus on hunting while still allowing for a sustainable balance between the wolf and sheep populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.07, which is only 17.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still enabling some hunting to support wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.50, which is only 15.0% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I also recognize the importance of allowing the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help me maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.23, which is only 12.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.01, which is only 11.8% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.35 aligns with the wisdom of making small adjustments in response to the current state of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.86, which is only 10.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderate to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain its health. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 will help balance the need for hunting with the necessity of allowing the sheep to rebound.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.30, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a balance as the wolf population is relatively high, and it is essential to ensure that both populations can coexist sustainably."
