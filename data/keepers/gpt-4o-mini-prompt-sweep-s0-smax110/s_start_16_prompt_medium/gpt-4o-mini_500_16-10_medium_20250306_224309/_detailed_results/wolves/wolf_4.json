            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.00, which is only 14.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while still considering the need for sheep recovery and maintaining a balance with the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help support wolf reproduction while ensuring that the sheep population can recover and maintain balance. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low percentage of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we have a decent number of sheep available. However, with the wolf population at 9.00, I need to be cautious about overhunting. A moderate theta allows for sustainable hunting while also considering the need for the sheep population to recover and the wolf population to stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still recovering and is only at 16.9% of its maximum capacity. A moderate approach allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some hunting to support the wolf population. This gradual adjustment helps prevent over-depletion of sheep and maintains a balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain our wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for moderate hunting without risking depletion. This value reflects a balanced approach, enabling us to maintain our wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover slightly. As the sheep population is still below maximum capacity, I can afford to be cautious and avoid overhunting.",
