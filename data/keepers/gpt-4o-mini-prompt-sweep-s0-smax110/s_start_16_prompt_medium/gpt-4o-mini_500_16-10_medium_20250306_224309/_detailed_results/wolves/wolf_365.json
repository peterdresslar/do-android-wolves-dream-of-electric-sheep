            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. A lower theta will help maintain the sheep population while also addressing competition among wolves, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and my previous low hunting intensity has allowed for some recovery. However, I need to gradually increase my hunting intensity to ensure the wolf population remains healthy while still allowing the sheep to recover. A small increase to 0.25 reflects a cautious approach to balance both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is very close to its maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. With the wolf population also present, a slight increase in theta will help maintain balance while avoiding overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is close to its maximum capacity, indicating that they are abundant. However, the wolf population is relatively low, so I need to maintain a balance that allows for sustainable hunting while avoiding over-depletion of the sheep. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 95.51, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 47, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a sustainable balance. This adjustment will help support the wolf population without risking a rapid decline in the sheep numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while it is beneficial to hunt, I need to be cautious as the wolf population is also significant. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow sheep to recover while still ensuring that my pack can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 49.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 67, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting, which could lead to a crash in the sheep population. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for more hunting while still maintaining a balance that supports both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term survival of both species. This moderate adjustment helps maintain balance as the sheep population is recovering, and it allows for gradual adaptation to the changing dynamics of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.52, which is only 29.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I need to maintain a focus on hunting to support wolf reproduction, I must also be cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that supports both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.36, which is only 23.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I can increase my hunting intensity slightly, I should still prioritize a balanced approach to allow the sheep population to recover. A theta of 0.40 allows for some hunting while avoiding overexploitation, ensuring both wolves and sheep can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.32, which is only 18.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on the competition among wolves, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.30, which is only 15.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still being cautious about the sheep population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.72, which is only 13.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own wolf population. A slight increase in hunting intensity from my previous theta of 0.40 to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for sustainable cycles.",
