            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction without overly depleting the sheep population, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that can sustain both the wolf and sheep populations. This approach balances the need for reproduction among wolves while ensuring that the sheep population does not decline too rapidly, promoting long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 46.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 68, which is relatively high, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for a balanced approach that supports both sheep recovery and wolf population stability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the wolf population is relatively high. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain their numbers. This approach supports long-term coexistence and avoids depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level relative to its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from the previous theta, I can still focus on competition with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.10, which is only 22.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting sustainability without risking a rapid depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.82, which is only 18.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for the sheep to recover. By maintaining a moderate hunting intensity, I can ensure that the wolf population remains healthy while allowing the sheep to stabilize and grow. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.83, which is only 16.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.50, which is only 14.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 to 0.35 reflects a balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to support reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.6% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a sustainable balance. This gradual approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.96, which is only 11.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be increased slightly to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A gradual increase to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, ensuring that we do not deplete the sheep too quickly while still addressing the needs of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.21, which is only 11.1% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, a slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted to take advantage of the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.74, which is only 10.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both the sheep and the wolf population while still competing with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.58, which is only 10.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some reproduction among wolves while still giving sheep a chance to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.45, which is only 10.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By lowering my hunting intensity slightly, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize while still ensuring the wolf population remains healthy.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.50, which is only 10.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is an opportunity to increase hunting intensity slightly while still allowing for sheep recovery.
