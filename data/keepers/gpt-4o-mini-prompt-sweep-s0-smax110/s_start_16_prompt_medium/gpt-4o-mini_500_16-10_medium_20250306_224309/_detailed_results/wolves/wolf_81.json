This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",

This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and promotes long-term sustainability.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.96, which is only 23.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly.
