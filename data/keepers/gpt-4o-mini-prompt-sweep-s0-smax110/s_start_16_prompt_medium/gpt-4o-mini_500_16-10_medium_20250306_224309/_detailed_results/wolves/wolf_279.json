            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that they can sustain some hunting pressure without immediate risk of depletion. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain our wolf population while allowing for some recovery of the sheep. This approach balances our need for food with the long-term health of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A theta of 0.45 represents a balanced approach that supports the wolf population while preventing overhunting of sheep, ensuring sustainability in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. With a high sheep-to-wolf ratio and a growing wolf population, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a stable wolf population. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at its maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to recover and ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery. Maintaining a balance is crucial to prevent overexploitation of the sheep and ensure the long-term survival of both species. Gradual adjustments are key, and with the current sheep-to-wolf ratio being high, it",

Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. A gradual decrease in hunting will help maintain balance without risking a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. A moderate approach will help maintain balance and prevent depletion of the sheep, while still allowing for some hunting to support the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery and prevent depletion. Maintaining a focus on competition with other wolves will help stabilize our population while ensuring the sheep can bounce back in the future.",

However, I must remain cautious and avoid overhunting, as the wolf population is still relatively small. A gradual increase will help maintain balance while ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while ensuring that the sheep can recover. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, but the wolf population is also significant. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover further while still enabling us to maintain our numbers. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for sustainable coexistence.",

However, the wolf population is also relatively high, so a slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain their numbers. This moderate approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",

A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still providing enough resources for the wolves. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.82, which is only 24.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",

To allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population, a moderate hunting intensity is necessary.
