            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still being cautious. This adjustment reflects the need to balance our population growth with the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level (34.2% of maximum capacity), and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are not enough sheep to sustain higher hunting intensity without risking depletion. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain its health.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 29.08, which is only 26.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for sustainable cycles.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.28, which is only 21.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own wolf population. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity and promote a more sustainable balance between our populations."
