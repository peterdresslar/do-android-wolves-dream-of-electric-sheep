            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that we can afford to increase our hunting intensity slightly without risking depletion. However, since the wolf population is relatively stable, a moderate increase allows for sustainable coexistence while still being cautious about overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 89.9% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help ensure the wolf population remains healthy without over-depleting the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 78.3% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 53, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term health of both populations. This moderate adjustment will help maintain balance as the wolf population grows.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 52.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 67.00, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that supports both sheep recovery and wolf population health.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a balance as the sheep population is recovering, while also considering the growing wolf population. A gradual approach ensures we avoid sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population also being relatively high, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A gradual increase to 0.45 reflects a balanced approach that supports both the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.82, which is only 24.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring that both the wolf and sheep populations can thrive together while avoiding overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.89, which is only 19.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring a balanced approach that supports both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.58, which is only 16.0% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a moderate hunting intensity that can help sustain both populations without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.16, which is only 13.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting a lower theta, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize while preventing overhunting. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.48, which is only 12.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.14, which is only 11.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to allow the sheep to recover while still ensuring our wolf population remains stable. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our needs without depleting the sheep further, promoting a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.41, which is only 10.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover.
