            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 91.68, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help sustain wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep population does not decline too rapidly. A gradual approach is essential to maintain balance and avoid overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 70% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.31, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both populations can thrive. A moderate theta allows for continued hunting while also considering the long-term balance between wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. This value helps maintain the sheep population while ensuring that the wolf population can thrive without depleting resources too quickly. It reflects a cautious increase in hunting intensity, acknowledging the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 42.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with a wolf population of 70, we need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A moderate theta allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some hunting to support our population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 31.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.48, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level (24.0% of maximum capacity), which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking immediate depletion. This moderate adjustment will help sustain both populations while also considering the growing wolf numbers. It reflects a balanced approach to ensure long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.23, which is only 18.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is potential for recovery, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves to ensure our population remains stable. A lower theta allows for some hunting while giving sheep a chance to recover, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.96, which is only 15.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach that can help both populations stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.36, which is only 13.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should prioritize the recovery of the sheep population while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our own health. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking the depletion of sheep, thus promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.78, which is only 11.6% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a moderate hunting intensity that can help sustain both populations without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.59, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low at 0.28. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased slightly, it is essential to prioritize the recovery of the sheep population. A moderate increase in theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.93, which is only 9.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is a need for a cautious approach to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting to support the wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced strategy that promotes coexistence without over-depleting the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.38, which is only 9.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By adopting a lower theta, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.09, which is only 9.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain our population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.90, which is only 9.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 to 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need to compete with other wolves while still allowing for sustainable coexistence."
