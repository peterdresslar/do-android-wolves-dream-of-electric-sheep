            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 93.9% of maximum capacity, allowing for some increased hunting intensity without risking depletion. However, I want to avoid drastic changes, so a moderate decrease from my previous theta will help maintain balance while still supporting wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 84.3% of maximum capacity, allowing for some increased hunting intensity. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.93, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for moderate hunting without risking depletion. This value reflects a balanced approach, enabling us to maintain our wolf population while ensuring the sheep can recover and thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 45.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 34.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a wolf population of 70, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is low, suggesting that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing competition among wolves, which will help stabilize both populations in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 29.08, which is only 26.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I can increase my hunting intensity slightly, I need to be cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A small increase to 0.40 allows for some hunting while still promoting recovery in the sheep population, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.28, which is only 21.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for more hunting while still considering the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.07, which is only 17.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should prioritize the recovery of the sheep population while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our own health. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, reducing hunting intensity slightly to support sheep recovery while still competing with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.50, which is only 15.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a more balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.23, which is only 12.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack without depleting the sheep further, promoting a balance that can lead to long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I need to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.86, which is only 10.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for sheep recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.30, which is only 10.3% of its maximum capacity.
