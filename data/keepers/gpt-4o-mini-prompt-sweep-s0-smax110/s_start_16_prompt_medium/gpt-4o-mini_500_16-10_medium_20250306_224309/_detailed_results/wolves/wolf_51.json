            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 93.30, allowing for some increased hunting intensity without risking depletion. However, I want to ensure that the wolf population remains stable, so I am making a moderate adjustment rather than a drastic one. This will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 72.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with the wolf population at 56, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This approach balances our needs with the ecosystem",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the wolf population is relatively high. A moderate hunting intensity will allow for some sheep depletion while also enabling the sheep population to recover. This approach helps maintain a balance between the two populations, ensuring long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the growth of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while still competing effectively with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.10, which is only 22.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for moderate hunting without risking depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.82, which is only 18.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support our wolf population without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.83, which is only 16.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.50, which is only 14.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low at 12.6% of its maximum capacity, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking immediate depletion. This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover gradually.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.96, which is only 11.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support our wolf population but prioritizes the sustainability of the sheep, ensuring a balance that can lead to long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I need to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.74, which is only 10.7% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help balance the ecosystem and prevent over-depletion of sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.58, which is only 10.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need to adapt to the changing conditions."
