            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 83.2% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep do not become too depleted. A gradual approach is necessary to maintain balance and avoid sudden crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 89.7% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. However, with only 4 wolves, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that we should be cautious with our hunting to avoid depleting their numbers too quickly. A moderate approach allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some hunting to support our wolf population. This adjustment reflects the need to balance our immediate needs with the long-term health of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover and maintain a sustainable balance. This lower theta will help prevent overhunting and support the ecosystem",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery. Maintaining a lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, as it reduces pressure on the sheep population while allowing us to focus on competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and while it is tempting to increase hunting intensity, a more moderate approach will allow the sheep to recover and maintain a sustainable balance. Gradually increasing theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at its maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. With a high sheep-to-wolf ratio, focusing on competition among wolves will help maintain our population while giving sheep a chance to rebound.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover and ensures the long-term survival of both species. It also helps to stabilize the wolf population as we adapt to the current conditions.",

A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 will help support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover gradually.",

While I want to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I also need to allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and prevent over-depletion of the sheep, while still allowing for some hunting to support wolf reproduction.",

However, with the wolf population being relatively high, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring both populations can thrive without leading to depletion.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.87, which is only 29.9% of its maximum capacity.
