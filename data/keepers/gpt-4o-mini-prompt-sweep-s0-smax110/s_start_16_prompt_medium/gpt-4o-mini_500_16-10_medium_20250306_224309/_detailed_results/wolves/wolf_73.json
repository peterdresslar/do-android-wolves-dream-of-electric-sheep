However, with the wolf population at 68, which is relatively high, I need to be cautious about overhunting. A theta of 0.30 allows for a focus on competition with other wolves while still permitting some hunting, ensuring that both populations can stabilize and thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover over time. A moderate approach balances the needs of both species and avoids drastic changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.21, which is only 28.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it is crucial to maintain a balance to allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help sustain both populations and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.10, which is only 22.8% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep too quickly. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.82, which is only 18.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.4 to 0.35, I can still maintain some hunting while prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of avoiding sudden changes and responding to the current state of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.83, which is only 16.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still being mindful of the need to avoid overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.50, which is only 14.1% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing competition with other wolves, thus promoting a sustainable balance.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.74, which is only 10.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and allowing the sheep population to stabilize, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.58, which is only 10.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is an opportunity to hunt, I need to be cautious and avoid overexploitation. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This balanced approach will help maintain the ecosystem",

This indicates that there is potential for recovery if we reduce hunting intensity slightly.
