However, since the wolf population is also relatively low, a moderate increase allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. A moderate theta value will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can stabilize.",

Maintaining a lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep population.",

Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition among wolves while giving the sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery. Maintaining a lower theta will help prevent over-depletion of the sheep while still allowing for competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta reflects a cautious approach to hunting, balancing the need for wolf reproduction with the sustainability of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that they can sustain a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. A small increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the long-term health of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is close to its maximum capacity, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, to ensure long-term sustainability, I will increase my hunting intensity slightly while still being cautious to avoid depleting the sheep population too quickly. This moderate adjustment allows for a balance between competing with other wolves and maintaining a healthy sheep population.",

This moderate adjustment will help maintain balance as the sheep population is recovering, while also considering the growth of the wolf population.",

With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.80, it is important to maintain a balance that allows for sustainable coexistence. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help the sheep recover while still allowing for some hunting to support the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level relative to its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are not enough sheep to support a high hunting intensity. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious to prevent over-depletion of the sheep population.",

This suggests that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 will help us balance our competition with other wolves and ensure the sheep can regain their numbers without depleting them further.",
