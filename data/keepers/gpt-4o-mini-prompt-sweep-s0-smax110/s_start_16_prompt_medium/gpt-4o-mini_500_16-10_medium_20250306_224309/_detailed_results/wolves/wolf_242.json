            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 257\n- Sheep population: 11.86\n- Wolf population: 38.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.400\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.31 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 10.8% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 93.9% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover if needed. A gradual adjustment is key to maintaining balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 84.3% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain our wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover if needed. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain our wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and my previous theta of 0.55 was slightly aggressive given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.01. A slight reduction to 0.50 allows for continued hunting while also considering the need for balance as both populations are close to their limits. This adjustment promotes coexistence and prevents over-depletion of sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term health of both sheep and wolves. This moderate adjustment helps maintain a balance as the sheep population is recovering, while also considering the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 37.57, which is only 34.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done gradually to avoid depleting the sheep further. A theta of 0.40 allows for a slight increase in hunting while still focusing on the competition among wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 29.08, which is only 26.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should maintain a moderate hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while still ensuring our wolf population remains healthy. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 will help us adapt to the current conditions without risking a rapid depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.28, which is only 21.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity and promote a more sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.07, which is only 17.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep population too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.50, which is only 15.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that I can afford to increase my hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A moderate increase to 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, ensuring that both populations can thrive without leading to a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.23, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a significant competition for resources among wolves. By lowering my hunting intensity slightly, I can allow the sheep population to recover while still ensuring that my pack remains healthy. This moderate approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I need to maintain a balance, a slight increase in hunting intensity will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. This adjustment allows for a gradual response to the current ecosystem state while still considering the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.86, which is only 10.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on the competition with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance."
