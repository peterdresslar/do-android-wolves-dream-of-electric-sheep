            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. A lower theta will help maintain the balance between wolves and sheep, ensuring long-term survival for both species while preventing overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while also reducing competition among wolves. This approach supports the long-term survival of both species and maintains a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover and prevent overexploitation. This moderate approach will help maintain a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery. Maintaining a lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, preventing overhunting and promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating a need for a slight increase in hunting intensity to maintain balance. However, with the wolf population also present, I must be cautious not to overhunt and risk depleting the sheep too quickly. A moderate increase allows for sustainable coexistence while still supporting wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 97.35, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports the wolf population",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is key to avoiding sudden fluctuations in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 49.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 68, which is relatively high, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 41.82, which is only 38.0% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, allowing both populations to stabilize without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.45, which is only 29.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I need to maintain a focus on hunting to support the wolf population, I should do so cautiously to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 allows for a balanced approach that supports both populations without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.33, which is only 23.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should maintain a cautious approach to hunting to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.45 to 0.40, I can still focus on hunting while being mindful of the need for sustainable coexistence. This gradual adjustment will help balance our needs without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.32, which is only 18.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I need to maintain some hunting to support the wolf population, I should not overhunt to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 will help balance the needs of both populations without risking a crash.",

This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species."
