Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover while we focus on competition among wolves, ensuring a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be cautiously increased to prevent over-depletion. However, given the current wolf population and the need to maintain balance, a slight increase from my previous theta allows for sustainable hunting while still considering the long-term health of both species.",

To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover and prevent overexploitation. This moderate approach will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem.",

This will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term survival while avoiding overhunting. A slight decrease from my previous theta reflects the need to be cautious as the wolf population is also significant.",
