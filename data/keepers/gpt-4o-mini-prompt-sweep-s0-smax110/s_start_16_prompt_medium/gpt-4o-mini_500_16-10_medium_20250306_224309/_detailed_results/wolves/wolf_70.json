Increasing it slightly to 0.30 allows for a balanced approach that supports both sheep recovery and wolf population stability. This gradual adjustment helps maintain the delicate ecosystem without risking overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 36.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both species can thrive. A moderate increase to 0.40 allows for some hunting while still considering the long-term health of the sheep population.",

However, with the wolf population also being relatively high, I want to avoid overhunting and ensure that both populations can thrive. A gradual increase in theta will help maintain balance without risking a crash.",
