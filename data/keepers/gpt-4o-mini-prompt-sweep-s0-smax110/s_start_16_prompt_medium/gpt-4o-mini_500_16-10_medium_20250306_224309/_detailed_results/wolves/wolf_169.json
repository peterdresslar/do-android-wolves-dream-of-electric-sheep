            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 186\n- Sheep population: 11.59\n- Wolf population: 41.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.400\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.28 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 10.5% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a sustainable balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 93.7% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help sustain our wolf population while ensuring that the sheep do not deplete too quickly. A gradual approach is essential to maintain balance and avoid sudden crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 91.68, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain our wolf population while ensuring that we do not deplete the sheep too quickly. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid sudden population crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the sheep-to-wolf ratio being close to 1, it is essential to maintain a sustainable coexistence. A slight reduction from my previous theta will help ensure that the sheep can recover while still allowing for some hunting to support the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 42.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 70, which is relatively high, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and while it is important to hunt to sustain the wolf population, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, ensuring that both populations can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.44, which is only 24.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I need to maintain some hunting to support wolf reproduction, I should also be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the immediate needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.23, which is only 18.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting to sustain the wolf population. A theta of 0.35 reflects a moderate balance, focusing on competition with other wolves while allowing for gradual hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.96, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking their long-term survival. This adjustment helps to balance the needs of the wolf population while still allowing sheep to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.36, which is only 13.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By slightly decreasing my hunting intensity to 0.35, I can focus more on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.78, which is only 11.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. By increasing my theta slightly from 0.35 to 0.40, I can maintain a balance that allows for some hunting while still considering the long-term survival of both species. This small adjustment aligns with the wisdom of making gradual changes in response to population dynamics.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.59, which is only 10.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both populations."
