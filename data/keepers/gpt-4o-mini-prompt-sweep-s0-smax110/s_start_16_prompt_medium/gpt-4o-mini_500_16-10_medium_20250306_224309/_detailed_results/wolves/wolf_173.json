            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 187\n- Sheep population: 10.93\n- Wolf population: 37.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.350\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.30 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 9.9% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still healthy at 93.7% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 41, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, but I want to ensure that we do not overhunt them as the wolf population is also significant. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still supporting our pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 70% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, promoting sustainable coexistence while still allowing for some growth in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 54.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 67, which is relatively high compared to the sheep, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and allow both populations to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 42.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 70, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to prevent a crash in the sheep population. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for more hunting while still prioritizing balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 31.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for gradual hunting without risking depletion. With the wolf population at 71, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.44, which is only 24.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need to adapt to the changing conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.23, which is only 18.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is some room for hunting, it is crucial to avoid overexploitation to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting while still prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.96, which is only 15.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the immediate needs of the wolf pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.36, which is only 13.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting approach to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking the depletion of the sheep population, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and the wolf population is relatively high. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help sustain our numbers while allowing the sheep to recover gradually. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.59, which is only 10.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to allow for recovery. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.93, which is only 9.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is a need for a slight increase in hunting intensity to help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, ensuring that we do not deplete the sheep too quickly while also considering the growth of our own population."
