A moderate theta will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can stabilize, promoting long-term coexistence.",

This lower theta value will help maintain a balance and prevent over-depletion of the sheep, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at its maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in sheep numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition with other wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term balance in the ecosystem.",

Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both populations.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery. Maintaining a focus on competition with other wolves will help balance the ecosystem and prevent over-depletion of sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be cautiously increased to prevent over-depletion. However, given the current wolf population and the need for sustainable coexistence, a slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that supports both wolf reproduction and sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that they can sustain a slight increase in hunting intensity without causing immediate harm. A gradual increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the long-term health of the sheep population.",

This adjustment helps maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term survival for both.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 97.35, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are enough sheep to support our hunting without over-depleting their numbers. A slight reduction from my previous theta allows for a more cautious approach, ensuring that we do not push the sheep population too low while still allowing for some hunting to support our wolf pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 78.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with the wolf population at 53.00, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while I want to ensure my pack thrives, I also recognize the importance of allowing the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and prevent over-depletion of the sheep population, ensuring long-term survival for both wolves and sheep.",

This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover and maintain balance.",

While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I also want to allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, allowing both populations to stabilize without risking overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.45, which is only 29.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I can increase my hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. A moderate increase to 0.45 allows for a balanced approach that supports both wolf growth and sheep recovery.",

This suggests that while I need to maintain some hunting to support the wolf population, I should be cautious not to overhunt and further deplete the sheep. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.32, which is only 18.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is an opportunity to hunt, I must be cautious not to over-deplete the sheep. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach supports the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.62, which is only 15.1% of its maximum capacity.
