This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to ensure that both sheep and wolf populations can thrive without depleting resources too quickly.",

This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is key to avoiding drastic changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for some hunting without risking depletion. Given that the wolf population is also relatively high, a slight reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and allow sheep to recover while still supporting wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 41.82, which is only 38.0% of its maximum capacity. While I want to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to replenish while still enabling some hunting for sustenance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.45, which is only 29.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while I need to maintain a focus on hunting to support wolf reproduction, I must also be cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.33, which is only 23.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should maintain a cautious approach to hunting, allowing the sheep to recover while still ensuring our wolf population remains healthy. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.450 will help balance our needs without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.32, which is only 18.5% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to help sustain our wolf population while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep too quickly. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.40 will help maintain balance and avoid sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem."
