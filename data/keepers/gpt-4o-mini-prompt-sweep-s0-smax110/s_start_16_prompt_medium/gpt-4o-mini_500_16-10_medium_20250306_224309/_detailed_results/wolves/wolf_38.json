            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 40\n- Sheep population: 108.96\n- Wolf population: 34.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.067\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 3.20 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 99.1% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. A lower theta allows for competition among wolves, which can help control our numbers while giving sheep a chance to recover. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and I want to ensure that we maintain a sustainable balance. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can help support the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. This moderate approach allows for adaptation to the current conditions while keeping an eye on long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 93.30, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. It",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. It\u2019s important to maintain a balance as both populations are close to their respective capacities.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 46.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.75, it is essential to maintain a balanced approach to ensure both populations can thrive. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for some hunting while also considering the need for sheep recovery and the current wolf population dynamics.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting approach. This will help maintain the balance between wolf and sheep populations while avoiding overhunting. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need to ensure long-term survival, a slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow sheep to recover while still supporting our wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but I need to be cautious as the wolf population is relatively high. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery. This approach helps maintain balance without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.10, which is only 22.8% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable balance, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting sheep. This moderate approach will help maintain the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to increase.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.82, which is only 18.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will enable me to take advantage of the current sheep numbers without depleting them too quickly, maintaining a balance that supports both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.83, which is only 16.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.4 to 0.35, I can focus on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring a balance that supports both populations in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.50, which is only 14.1% of its maximum capacity. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help us take advantage of the available resources without depleting the sheep too quickly. This moderate adjustment allows for a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring our long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.87, which is only 12.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.4 to 0.35, I can maintain a balance that focuses on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, promoting sustainability in the ecosystem.",

This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of my pack."
