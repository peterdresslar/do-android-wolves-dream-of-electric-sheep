However, with the wolf population also being significant, I must be cautious not to overhunt. A moderate increase to 0.45 allows for continued reproduction while maintaining a balance with the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 49.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.81, it suggests that the sheep population is relatively low compared to the wolf population. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while still ensuring that my pack remains healthy. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still considering the need to maintain a balance with the sheep population. A gradual increase from my previous theta aligns with the wisdom of adapting to current conditions without risking a sudden depletion of sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.52, which is only 29.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is an opportunity to hunt, I need to be cautious and avoid over-depleting the sheep. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing the sheep population to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.36, which is only 23.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.32, which is only 18.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our needs without depleting the sheep further, promoting a healthier balance in the ecosystem."
