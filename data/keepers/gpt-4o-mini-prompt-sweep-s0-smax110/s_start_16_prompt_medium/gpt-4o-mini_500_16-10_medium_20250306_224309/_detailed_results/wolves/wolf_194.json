            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 70% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 59, which is relatively high, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring both populations can thrive without leading to depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term survival of both species. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to ensure that the sheep can recover while also supporting the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 31.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 71, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both populations can thrive. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for more hunting while still focusing on balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.44, which is only 24.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I can still hunt, I need to be cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.23, which is only 18.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on the competition among wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.96, which is only 15.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while we need to be cautious about overhunting, a slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted to take advantage of the current sheep population before it recovers significantly. A theta of 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still being mindful of the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.36, which is only 13.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to allow the sheep to recover while still ensuring our wolf population remains stable. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting without over-depleting the sheep, promoting a sustainable balance.",

This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to allow for recovery. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.93, which is only 9.9% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will enable me to hunt a bit more effectively while still prioritizing the long-term balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.38, which is only 9.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 reflects a focus on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, promoting a sustainable balance.",

This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to stabilize while still competing with other wolves. This moderate approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",

This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for wolves to thrive.",

This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover.
