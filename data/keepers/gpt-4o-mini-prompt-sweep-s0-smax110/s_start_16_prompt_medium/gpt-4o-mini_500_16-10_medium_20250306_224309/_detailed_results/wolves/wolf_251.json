            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 92.70, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for sustainable coexistence. By gradually increasing my hunting intensity, I can support the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep have a chance to recover and thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual increase is necessary to ensure we don",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain our wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid destabilizing the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 45.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 69, I need to be cautious about over-hunting. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 29.08, which is only 26.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight reduction in hunting intensity allows for a more sustainable balance, giving sheep a chance to recover while still enabling wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.28, which is only 21.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover while also managing the wolf population. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance and prevent over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.07, which is only 17.3% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balanced approach. By gradually increasing theta, I can help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.50, which is only 15.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By setting a theta of 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This gradual adjustment will help ensure sustainable coexistence in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.23, which is only 12.9% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. A moderate increase to 0.40 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring both populations can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.01, which is only 11.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for some hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.86, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking their long-term survival. This adjustment will help maintain a balance as the sheep population recovers, while also supporting the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.30, which is only 10.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our wolf population without depleting the sheep further, promoting a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.82, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is an opportunity to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction while still allowing for some recovery of the sheep population. A gradual increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, ensuring we do not deplete the sheep too quickly while also considering the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.69, which is only 9.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and allowing the sheep population to stabilize without depleting their numbers further."
