            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still ensuring that the sheep can recover. A gradual adjustment is key to avoiding drastic fluctuations in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 31.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 71, it is wise to avoid overhunting to prevent a crash in the sheep population. A moderate increase in hunting intensity allows for a balance that supports both species while adapting to the current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 24.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 69.00, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.23, which is only 18.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is some potential for recovery, I need to prioritize the competition with other wolves to ensure our population remains stable. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while also giving sheep a chance to recover without depleting their numbers too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.96, which is only 15.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of the wolf pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.36, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring both populations can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.78, which is only 11.6% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.59, which is only 10.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting strategy to ensure our own survival. A theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while prioritizing the long-term balance between our populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.93, which is only 9.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is a need to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support the wolf population.
