            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 78.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with the wolf population at 53.00, it is wise to maintain a balanced approach to avoid over-depleting the sheep while ensuring the wolf population remains stable. A moderate increase in hunting intensity allows for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the sheep population at 64.5% of its maximum capacity and a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.16, I can maintain a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This gradual adjustment helps avoid over-depletion of the sheep and promotes long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level (38.0% of maximum capacity), and while I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must also be cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, enabling both wolves and sheep to thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.45, which is only 29.5% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.33, which is only 23.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable, and I need to prioritize their recovery while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our wolf population. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help balance the ecosystem and support the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.32, which is only 18.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.62, which is only 15.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population and maintaining a balance with the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.54, which is only 13.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we are competing for limited resources. A moderate approach will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling us to hunt enough to maintain our population. This gradual adjustment helps ensure long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.02, which is only 10.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.19, which is only 10.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for hunting with the necessity of sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.76, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are struggling, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to recover. Additionally, with a wolf population of 31, focusing on competition among wolves rather than aggressive hunting will help maintain our numbers while giving the sheep a chance to bounce back.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.61, which is only 9.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a slight hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A small increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.52, which is only 9.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should be cautious with our hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.44, there is still some competition among wolves, so a slight increase in theta to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach that supports both wolf reproduction and sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.59, which is only 9.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.4 to 0.35, I can maintain a focus on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring a balance that supports both populations in the long term."
