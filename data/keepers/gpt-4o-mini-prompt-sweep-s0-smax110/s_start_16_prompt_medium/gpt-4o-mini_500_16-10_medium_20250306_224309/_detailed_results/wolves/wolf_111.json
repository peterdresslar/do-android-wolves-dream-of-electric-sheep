            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 88% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This slight decrease from my previous theta reflects a cautious approach to maintain balance as the wolf population grows.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 76.7% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate hunting approach. This will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can recover. A slight decrease from my previous theta will help adapt to the growing wolf population while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must do so gradually to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that considers both the current sheep population and the need to maintain a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 50.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population being relatively high, a slight reduction in hunting intensity is prudent to allow for coexistence and prevent over-depletion of sheep. This moderate adjustment will help maintain balance while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery. A gradual increase is essential to maintain balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.87, which is only 29.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while maintaining a healthy wolf population. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help balance our needs with the sustainability of the ecosystem, ensuring that both wolves and sheep can thrive in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.96, which is only 23.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.79, which is only 18.9% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.38, which is only 15.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support our wolf population without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.29, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.60, which is only 12.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to allow for recovery. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both sheep and wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.54, which is only 11.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.85, which is only 10.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.4 to 0.35, I can maintain a balance that focuses on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.50, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking over-depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations while ensuring our pack"
