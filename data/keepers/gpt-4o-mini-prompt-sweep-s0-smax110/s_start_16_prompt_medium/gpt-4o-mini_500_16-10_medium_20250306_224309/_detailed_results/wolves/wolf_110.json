            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 88% of maximum capacity, allowing for some increased hunting intensity without risking a significant depletion of their numbers. This will help sustain our wolf population while still considering the need for balance as the wolf numbers grow.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for some increased hunting intensity without risking their depletion. However, with the wolf population also being significant, a moderate approach will help maintain balance and ensure both populations can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can continue to thrive. A gradual adjustment is key to avoiding overexploitation and ensuring long-term balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. While the sheep population is recovering, I want to ensure that my pack remains healthy without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight reduction from my previous theta will help maintain sustainability as the wolf population is also significant.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual approach is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly, especially as the wolf population is relatively high.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.87, which is only 29.9% of its maximum capacity. While there is a need to hunt to sustain the wolf population, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while also giving the sheep a chance to recover, ensuring a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.96, which is only 23.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is a need to hunt to support the wolf population, we should not overhunt and risk depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some hunting to support our pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.79, which is only 18.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A moderate increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach, ensuring sustainability without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.38, which is only 15.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By lowering my hunting intensity slightly, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some sustainable hunting. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.29, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring both populations can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.54, which is only 11.4% of its maximum capacity. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.32, it is crucial to focus on allowing the sheep to recover rather than intensifying hunting. This lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and ensure long-term survival for both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be cautiously increased to allow for some recovery while still competing with other wolves. A small increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.50, which is only 10.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for wolves to thrive."
