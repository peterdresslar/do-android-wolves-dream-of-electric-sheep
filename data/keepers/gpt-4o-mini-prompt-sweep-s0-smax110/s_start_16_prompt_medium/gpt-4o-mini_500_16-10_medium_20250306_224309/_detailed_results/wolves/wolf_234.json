            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity can be increased without risking immediate depletion. However, I must be cautious and avoid overhunting, as the wolf population is also significant. A moderate increase allows for sustainable coexistence while still supporting wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that we should maintain a balanced approach to hunting. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some hunting to support our wolf population. This adjustment helps prevent over-depletion of sheep while allowing for gradual adaptation to changing conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 93.9% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that can sustain both populations. This slight reduction from my previous theta of 0.55 reflects a cautious approach to ensure the wolf population does not grow too quickly while still allowing for some hunting to support reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 84.3% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 48, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to ensure sustainability, as the sheep population is recovering but not overly abundant.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual increase is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, and while it is beneficial to increase hunting intensity as the sheep population rises, I must also consider the growing wolf population. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and allow the sheep to recover while ensuring our pack remains healthy.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A gradual increase is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 29.08, which is only 26.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing our own population. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity and promote a sustainable balance, preventing overexploitation of the sheep and ensuring our long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.28, which is only 21.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.07, which is only 17.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while we need to be cautious about hunting to allow the sheep to recover, we also need to maintain a moderate level of hunting to support our own population. A theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.50, which is only 15.0% of its maximum capacity. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help us take advantage of the available resources without depleting the sheep too quickly. This adjustment allows for a more sustainable coexistence while still considering the need for our wolf population to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.23, which is only 12.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on the competition with other wolves, ensuring a balance that supports both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.01, which is only 11.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly."
