            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 63.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep. However, with the wolf population also being relatively high, a moderate hunting intensity will allow for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves. This approach helps to avoid depleting the sheep population too quickly and allows for gradual adjustments as conditions change.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A moderate approach balances our needs with the ecosystem",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.87, which is only 29.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to allow for recovery. A slight decrease from my previous theta of 0.45 will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can stabilize and grow.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.96, which is only 23.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that considers both the current needs of the wolf population and the sustainability of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.79, which is only 18.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight reduction from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still enabling some hunting to support reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.38, which is only 15.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.4 to 0.35, I can still maintain a focus on competition with other wolves while allowing for some sustainable hunting. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.29, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should be cautious with our hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a bit more hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the sustainability of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.60, which is only 12.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on the competition among wolves, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be increased slightly to support wolf reproduction while still allowing for some recovery of the sheep population. This gradual increase aligns with the wisdom of maintaining balance and adapting to current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.85, which is only 10.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 to 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for wolf survival while giving sheep a chance to rebound.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.50, which is only 10.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a more balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.13, which is only 10.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help balance the ecosystem and avoid depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.06, which is only 10.1% of its maximum capacity. With the wolf population at 24.00, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help balance the ecosystem and ensure long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.25, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderate to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance between hunting and ensuring the sheep population can stabilize.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.71, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring both species can thrive without risking a crash."
