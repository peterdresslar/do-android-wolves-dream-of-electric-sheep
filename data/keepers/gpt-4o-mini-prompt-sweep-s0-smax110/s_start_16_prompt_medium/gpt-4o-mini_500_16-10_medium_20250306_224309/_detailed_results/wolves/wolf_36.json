            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that we can afford to hunt more intensively without risking immediate depletion. However, given the current wolf population and the need for sustainable coexistence, a moderate increase allows for a balance that supports both our growth and the recovery of sheep in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and we are approaching the maximum capacity. A moderate hunting intensity will allow us to maintain a sustainable balance while still ensuring our pack can thrive. This approach will help prevent over-depletion of the sheep and support our long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance and avoid over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and the wolf population is also healthy. A moderate hunting intensity allows for continued coexistence while enabling the sheep to recover slightly. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining balance and responding to population trends without causing sudden shifts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 59.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population also being relatively high, a moderate approach will help maintain balance and prevent over-depletion of sheep while allowing for some hunting to support wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 46.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.75, it is crucial to maintain a balanced approach to ensure the long-term survival of both populations. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity from the previous theta, I can allow the sheep to recover while still ensuring the wolf population remains healthy.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing sheep to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A slight decrease from my previous theta will help balance the needs of both populations while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.10, which is only 22.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is some opportunity for hunting, it is crucial to avoid overexploitation to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.82, which is only 18.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.83, which is only 16.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should prioritize the recovery of the sheep population while still allowing for some hunting to sustain our wolf pack. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, reducing hunting intensity slightly to promote sheep growth while still competing with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.50, which is only 14.1% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I also want to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help me maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.87, which is only 12.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting strategy. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support our wolf population without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance."
