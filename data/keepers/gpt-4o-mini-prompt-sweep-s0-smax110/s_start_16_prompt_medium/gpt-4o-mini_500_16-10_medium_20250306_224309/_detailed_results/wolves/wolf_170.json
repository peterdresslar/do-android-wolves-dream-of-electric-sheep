            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that we can still hunt more intensively without risking immediate depletion. However, I want to avoid drastic changes, so a slight reduction from my previous theta allows for sustainable hunting while still supporting wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for continued hunting without risking depletion. However, I need to be cautious as the wolf population is also growing, so a moderate reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and ensure sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 91.68, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking over-depletion. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while maintaining a sustainable balance with the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 70% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep. A moderate theta of 0.55 allows for balanced hunting that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep population can sustain itself. This approach helps maintain a dynamic equilibrium between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the sheep-to-wolf ratio being close to 1:1, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep. This moderate adjustment will help maintain the health of both populations without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 31.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 71, which is relatively high, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight decrease in hunting intensity allows for a balance that can support both populations without leading to depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.44, which is only 24.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I need to maintain some hunting to support wolf reproduction, I should not overhunt to allow the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach that considers both the current sheep numbers and the need to avoid depleting their population further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.23, which is only 18.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and allowing the sheep population to stabilize, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.96, which is only 15.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach to hunting while still considering the need to compete with other wolves as the population is relatively high.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.36, which is only 13.1% of its maximum capacity. While I want to ensure the survival of my pack, I also recognize the need to allow the sheep population to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing competition with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.78, which is only 11.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.59, which is only 10.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population and maintaining a balance with the growing wolf population."
