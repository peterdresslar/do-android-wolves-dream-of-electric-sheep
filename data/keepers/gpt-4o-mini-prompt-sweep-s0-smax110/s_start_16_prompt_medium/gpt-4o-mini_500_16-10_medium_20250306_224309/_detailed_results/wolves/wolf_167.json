            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 186\n- Sheep population: 11.59\n- Wolf population: 41.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.350\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.28 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 10.5% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be low to allow for recovery. With a high sheep-to-wolf ratio and a growing wolf population, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. A lower theta allows for competition among wolves, which can help maintain our numbers while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 93.7% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual increase in theta will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain the wolf population while still considering the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 70% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with the wolf population at 59, it's wise to maintain a slightly lower hunting intensity to allow for sustainable coexistence and to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. This gradual adjustment will help ensure both populations can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction without risking a rapid decline in the sheep population, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 42.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.66, it is important to maintain a balance that allows for the recovery of sheep while also considering the needs of the wolf population. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help ensure the long-term survival of both species without risking a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 31.2% of maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 71, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to prevent future crashes. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still considering the long-term balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.44, which is only 24.0% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing competition among wolves, which will help balance the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.23, which is only 18.4% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still being cautious. A moderate increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly. It also considers the current wolf population of 65, which is relatively high, suggesting that a gradual adjustment is necessary to maintain sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.96, which is only 15.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.36, which is only 13.1% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, a slight increase in hunting intensity will help balance the needs of both species without depleting the sheep too quickly. This moderate adjustment allows for sustainable coexistence while still addressing the immediate needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.78, which is only 11.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it is crucial to avoid overexploitation. A moderate increase to 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population, ensuring long-term sustainability for both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.59, which is only 10.5% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I also want to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will enable me to hunt more effectively while still prioritizing the long-term balance of the ecosystem."
