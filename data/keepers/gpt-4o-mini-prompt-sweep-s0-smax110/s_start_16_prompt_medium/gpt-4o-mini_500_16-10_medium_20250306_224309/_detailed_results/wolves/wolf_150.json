With a high sheep-to-wolf ratio, focusing more on competition with other wolves will help maintain a stable wolf population while ensuring the sheep can thrive in the long term.",

Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover and ensures the long-term survival of both species. This approach also helps to stabilize the wolf population as we adapt to the current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover while we focus on competition among wolves, ensuring long-term sustainability for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and while I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta will enable me to maintain some hunting while still prioritizing the balance of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover and prevent overexploitation, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery. Maintaining a lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, preventing overhunting and potential crashes in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery. Maintaining a lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, as it prevents overhunting and supports a sustainable ecosystem.",

A moderate increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the long-term health of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 91.68, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we can afford to be cautious. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover further while still enabling us to maintain a sustainable wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 70% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population also being relatively high, I want to avoid overhunting and allow for a gradual balance. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for more hunting while still considering the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring long-term sustainability.",

This adjustment will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population does not decline too rapidly.",

While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and prevent over-depletion of the sheep, while still allowing for some hunting to support wolf reproduction.",

This moderate adjustment helps maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep can recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.23, which is only 18.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight reduction from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, focusing on sustainable coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.96, which is only 15.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.400 to 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring a balance that supports both populations in the long term."
