            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 248\n- Sheep population: 64.46\n- Wolf population: 64.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.165\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 1.01 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 58.6% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

This adjustment will help maintain the sheep population while allowing for some growth in the wolf population as well.",

However, with the wolf population at 69, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to prevent future crashes. A moderate increase in theta allows for a balanced approach that supports both sheep recovery and wolf population stability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery. A gradual increase is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 29.08, which is only 26.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.28, which is only 21.2% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still being cautious. A gradual increase to 0.40 will help maintain a balance between hunting and allowing the sheep to recover, ensuring the long-term survival of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.07, which is only 17.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population and maintaining a balance with the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.50, which is only 15.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain our wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.23, which is only 12.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack without depleting the sheep further, promoting a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and my previous theta was already on the lower end. A slight increase to 0.40 allows for a more balanced approach to hunting while still being cautious, enabling the sheep population to recover gradually. This adjustment reflects the need to adapt to the current conditions without risking over-depletion of the sheep.",

A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support our wolf population without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.30, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking over-depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between the wolf and sheep populations, ensuring our long-term survival while still allowing for some growth in our numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.82, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting a lower theta, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize while avoiding overhunting. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.69, which is only 9.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover, and focusing on competition with other wolves will help maintain our population while allowing the sheep to bounce back. A lower theta will help avoid depleting the sheep further and promote a more sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.80, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderate to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to sustain itself. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 reflects a cautious approach to hunting, balancing the need for food with the necessity of maintaining the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.93, which is only 9.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves rather than hunting intensively, allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This approach aligns with my objective of ensuring the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.17, which is only 10.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting without risking depletion. However, with a wolf population of 17.00, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition among wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.54, which is only 10.5% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I also want to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help me maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability without depleting the sheep further.",
