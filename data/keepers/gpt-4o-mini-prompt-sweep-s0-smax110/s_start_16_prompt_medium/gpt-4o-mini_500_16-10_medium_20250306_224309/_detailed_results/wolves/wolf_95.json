            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 117\n- Sheep population: 15.29\n- Wolf population: 50.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.350\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.31 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 13.9% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that they can sustain some hunting pressure without immediate risk of depletion. However, with the wolf population also growing, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and while I need to maintain a healthy wolf population, I also want to ensure that the sheep can recover. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will allow for some reproduction among wolves while still considering the sustainability of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is close to its maximum capacity, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are enough sheep to support a moderate hunting intensity. This allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling the wolf population to thrive. A slight reduction from my previous theta will help prevent overhunting and ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 88% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This adjustment reflects a balanced approach, responding to the current conditions without risking a dramatic decline in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 76.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.62, it is essential to maintain a balance that allows both populations to thrive. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for sustainable hunting while also considering the growth of the wolf population, ensuring we do not deplete the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and I want to increase my hunting intensity slightly to take advantage of the healthy sheep numbers while still allowing for their recovery. This moderate increase will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 50.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 65, which is relatively high, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, ensuring that both populations can thrive without leading to depletion or competition issues.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 38.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 68, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.87, which is only 29.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still considering the need for sheep recovery and maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.96, which is only 23.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.40 allows for some hunting while also considering the need for sheep recovery and maintaining a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I need to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.38, which is only 15.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring a balance that supports both populations in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.29, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of my pack."
