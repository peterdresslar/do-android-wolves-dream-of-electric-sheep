            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This moderate approach will help sustain both the wolf and sheep populations without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to maintain balance in the ecosystem, considering the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 62.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. However, with the wolf population also being relatively high, a slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. This moderate approach helps ensure long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing sheep to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 38.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, which is relatively high, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring both populations can thrive without leading to depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 29.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for gradual hunting without risking depletion. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.47, a slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance while allowing for some recovery of the sheep population. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of making small changes in response to population trends.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.36, which is only 23.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is some room for hunting, it is essential to prioritize the recovery of the sheep population to ensure long-term sustainability. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while also focusing on competition with other wolves, which can help stabilize our population without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.32, which is only 18.5% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.35 aligns with the wisdom of making small adjustments while still considering the need for balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.30, which is only 15.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.72, which is only 13.4% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the balance needed for both populations to thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.33, which is only 12.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I can increase my hunting intensity slightly, I must do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A theta of 0.40 allows for a modest increase in hunting while still considering the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.29, which is only 11.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.4 to 0.35, I can still maintain some hunting activity while prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both populations. This moderate adjustment aligns with the wisdom of balancing competition with hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity slightly to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A gradual increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of my pack."
