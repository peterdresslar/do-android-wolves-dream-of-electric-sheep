By increasing it to 0.3, I can focus on a balanced approach that allows for some hunting while still giving sheep a chance to recover. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 49.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 68, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A moderate increase to 0.40 allows for some hunting while still considering the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 41.82, which is only 38.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that I can afford to increase my hunting intensity slightly to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A gradual increase to 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, ensuring that both populations can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 29.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 70, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.33, which is only 23.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still being mindful of the need to compete with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.32, which is only 18.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I need to maintain some hunting to support wolf reproduction, I should prioritize competition with other wolves to allow the sheep population to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach that can help sustain both populations over time.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.62, which is only 15.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase to 0.40 allows for a more balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still giving sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.54, which is only 13.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting without depleting the sheep further, balancing the needs of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.90, which is only 11.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can grow, ultimately supporting the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.02, which is only 10.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should be cautious with our hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still recognizing the need to support our wolf population.",

This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.76, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to be cautious with our hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of both populations. It also helps to avoid over-depletion of the sheep, ensuring our long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.61, which is only 9.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting without risking depletion.

This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover.

This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A small increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without risking a crash in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity to ensure the wolf population can thrive, I must do so gradually to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that supports both populations.",
