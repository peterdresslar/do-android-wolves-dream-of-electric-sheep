A theta of 0.60 allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while ensuring that the sheep population can recover and maintain balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A moderate theta value will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can stabilize, promoting long-term sustainability.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery. Maintaining a lower theta will help prevent overexploitation of the sheep and ensure a sustainable balance as the wolf population grows.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at its maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at maximum capacity, indicating that they are vulnerable to overhunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach helps maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. With a high sheep-to-wolf ratio, focusing on competition with other wolves will help maintain our population while giving sheep a chance to rebound.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in sheep numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover while keeping the wolf population stable. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers, jeopardizing the long-term balance of the ecosystem. Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover while we focus on competition among wolves, ensuring our survival as well.",

Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover while we focus on competition among wolves, ensuring a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep too quickly. A small increase allows for a more sustainable balance while still considering the current high sheep-to-wolf ratio.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while ensuring that the sheep can recover. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 95.51, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while maintaining a sustainable balance. This adjustment reflects the need to support wolf reproduction without over-depleting the sheep population, considering the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the trends in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 74.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still a healthy number of sheep available. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.49, it is important to maintain a balance that allows for both wolf and sheep populations to thrive. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help ensure the long-term survival of both species while allowing the sheep to recover and the wolf population to stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is key to avoiding sudden population crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 49.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 67, which is relatively high compared to the sheep, I need to be cautious to avoid over-depleting the sheep. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring the long-term survival of both species while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment aims to support the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 29.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.47, it is important to maintain a balanced approach to ensure the sheep can recover while also allowing the wolf population to thrive. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help sustain both populations without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.36, which is only 23.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for increased hunting intensity without depleting the sheep too quickly. However, with the wolf population at 66.00, I must be cautious and avoid over-hunting. A slight increase to 0.45 allows for sustainable hunting while still considering the long-term health of both populations."
