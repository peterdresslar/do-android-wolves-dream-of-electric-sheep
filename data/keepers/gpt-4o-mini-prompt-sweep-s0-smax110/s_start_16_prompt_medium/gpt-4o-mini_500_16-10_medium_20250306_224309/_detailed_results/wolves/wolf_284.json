Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover and ensures the long-term survival of both species. It is crucial to focus on competition with other wolves at this stage to stabilize the wolf population before considering an increase in hunting.",

By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at its maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition with other wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",

To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I will gradually increase my hunting intensity while still prioritizing competition with other wolves. This approach allows for a slight increase in hunting while still giving sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while also addressing the increasing competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment helps maintain a balance between both populations, ensuring long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that they can sustain a moderate increase in hunting intensity. A theta of 0.40 allows for a gradual increase in hunting while still considering the need for balance, as the wolf population is relatively stable. This approach will help maintain both populations without risking depletion.",

This will help sustain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. It\u2019s important to avoid drastic changes, so a gradual adjustment towards a more balanced approach is ideal.",

However, with the wolf population at 69, which is relatively high, I need to focus on competition among wolves to prevent overhunting and allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach that balances the need for hunting with the necessity of maintaining a sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.27, which is only 31.2% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A gradual increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.82, which is only 24.4% of its maximum capacity.
