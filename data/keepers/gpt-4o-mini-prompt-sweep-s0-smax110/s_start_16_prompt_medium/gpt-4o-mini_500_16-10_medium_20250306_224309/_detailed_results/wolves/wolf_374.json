            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 95.2% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population while keeping the sheep numbers in check. A moderate increase from my previous theta reflects a cautious approach to balance the needs of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 95.51, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a sustainable balance. This adjustment will help ensure the wolf population can thrive without over-depleting the sheep, which is crucial for long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, but the wolf population is also significant. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain their numbers. This adjustment aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence and avoids sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance. This adjustment will help sustain both populations without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 38.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, I need to be cautious about overhunting to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.52, which is only 29.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a more balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the recovery of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.36, which is only 23.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population and maintaining a balance with the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.32, which is only 18.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach to hunting while still considering the need to compete with other wolves as their population is relatively high.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.30, which is only 15.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased slightly to support wolf reproduction, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate increase to 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.72, which is only 13.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing our own population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our needs without depleting the sheep further, promoting a more balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.33, which is only 12.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.29, which is only 11.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate approach allows for some hunting while still enabling the sheep population to recover, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.62, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment helps maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species."
