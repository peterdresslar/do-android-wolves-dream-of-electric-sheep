            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 402\n- Sheep population: 10.98\n- Wolf population: 31.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.350\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.35 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 10.0% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 95.51, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while ensuring we do not over-deplete their numbers. This adjustment reflects a balance between sustaining our wolf population and allowing the sheep to recover, considering the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need for gradual changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while I want to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I also recognize the need to allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and prevent over-depletion of the sheep, while still allowing for some hunting to support wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain the wolf population while still ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual increase is wise to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 49.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 67, which is relatively high, I need to be cautious about overhunting. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover over time.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.52, which is only 29.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I need to maintain a focus on hunting to support the wolf population, I should do so cautiously to allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease from my previous theta will help balance the needs of both populations without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.36, which is only 23.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain our population while allowing the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 will enable me to take advantage of the sheep's current numbers without depleting them too quickly, promoting a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.32, which is only 18.5% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.45 to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for some hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.30, which is only 15.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on the competition with other wolves, promoting a more sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and while I need to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from the previous theta, I can still focus on competition with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we need to be cautious in our hunting to avoid depleting their numbers further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a bit more hunting to support wolf reproduction while still focusing on the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.62, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting without risking the depletion of sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.98, which is only 10.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without risking the sheep population"
