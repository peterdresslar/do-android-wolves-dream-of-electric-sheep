            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is at 54.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating a potential for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.90, it is important to allow the sheep to recover while also considering the growing wolf population. A lower theta will help balance competition among wolves and allow for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 42.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 70, which is relatively high, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A moderate increase in theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves to maintain balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.36, which is only 31.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is room for sustainable hunting, I need to be cautious not to over-deplete the sheep. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a bit more hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the long-term balance of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.44, which is only 24.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach that can help both populations stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.23, which is only 18.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I need to focus on hunting to support the wolf population, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance, ensuring that both populations can thrive without leading to a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.96, which is only 15.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for gradual hunting to help sustain the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.36, which is only 13.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for wolf reproduction with the sustainability of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.78, which is only 11.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus more on competing with other wolves while still ensuring the sheep population has a chance to grow, promoting long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.59, which is only 10.5% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a modest increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.93, which is only 9.9% of its maximum capacity. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover while also addressing the competition among wolves. This approach supports the long-term survival of both species and avoids depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.38, which is only 9.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be slightly increased to support wolf reproduction, it is crucial to avoid overhunting to allow the sheep to recover. A gradual increase to 0.35 reflects a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.09, which is only 9.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some recovery while still ensuring that the wolf population remains healthy. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting sustainability without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.90, which is only 9.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of both populations, ensuring that we do not deplete the sheep further as we also consider the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is quite low at 9.93, which is only 9.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. However, with 22 wolves, we must also ensure our population remains healthy. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still recognizing the need to hunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.02, which is only 9.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing our need for sustenance with the necessity of ensuring the sheep can rebound.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.26, which is only 9.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting sustainability while still being mindful of the wolf population growth.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.57, which is only 9.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring that we do not deplete the sheep further and can maintain a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.00, which is only 10% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still being cautious. By raising theta to 0.40, I can maintain a balance that supports both the wolf population and allows the sheep to recover without depleting their numbers too quickly."
