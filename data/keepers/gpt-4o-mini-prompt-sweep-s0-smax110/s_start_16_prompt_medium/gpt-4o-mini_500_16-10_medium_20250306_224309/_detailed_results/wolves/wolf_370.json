            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that a more moderate hunting intensity is necessary to prevent depletion. This value allows for a balanced approach, ensuring that both sheep and wolf populations can thrive without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and while it is important to maintain a healthy wolf population, I want to ensure that we do not overhunt the sheep. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow for sustainable coexistence while still enabling us to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This approach balances our needs with the sustainability of the ecosystem, avoiding drastic changes that could destabilize both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, but I need to be cautious about overhunting as the wolf population is also significant. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to thrive. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing sheep to recover gradually.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 49.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 67, which is relatively high compared to the sheep, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 38.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 29.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with a wolf population of 69, I need to be cautious about overhunting. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still providing enough resources for the wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.36, which is only 23.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it is wise to maintain a lower theta to allow the sheep population to recover. Additionally, with a wolf population of 66, focusing on competition among wolves is necessary to prevent overhunting and ensure long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.32, which is only 18.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain our wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.30, which is only 15.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need to adapt to the changing conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the wolf population is relatively high. A lower theta allows us to focus on competing with other wolves, which can help stabilize our numbers while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.33, which is only 12.1% of its maximum capacity. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.30, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and a slight increase in hunting intensity will help us maintain our numbers without depleting the sheep too quickly. This moderate adjustment allows for some hunting while still considering the long-term sustainability of both populations."
