            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still healthy at 89.9% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover if needed. A gradual increase is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the sheep-to-wolf ratio being 1.21, it indicates that while there are enough sheep for hunting, I should avoid overexploitation to ensure long-term survival. A slight reduction from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach as the wolf population is also significant, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 52.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 67.00, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to prevent a crash in the sheep population. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 69, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both populations can thrive. A slight decrease in hunting intensity allows for a sustainable balance while still acknowledging the need to adapt to the current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This will help support wolf reproduction while still ensuring that the sheep population can recover. A gradual adjustment is necessary to maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.82, which is only 24.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring that both wolf and sheep populations can coexist while also considering the recent growth in wolf numbers. This gradual adjustment helps maintain stability in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.89, which is only 19.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.58, which is only 16.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. By increasing theta slightly from 0.35 to 0.40, I can maintain a balance that promotes coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.16, which is only 13.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I need to maintain some hunting to support wolf reproduction, I should focus more on allowing the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for sustenance with the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.48, which is only 12.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.14, which is only 11.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 maintains a balance between competing with other wolves and allowing the sheep population to stabilize, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.41, which is only 10.4% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still being cautious. A moderate increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, enabling us to sustain our wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. It also allows for gradual adjustments as conditions change.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.77, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to ensure our wolf population remains healthy. A slight increase from my previous theta will help balance our needs without depleting the sheep further."
