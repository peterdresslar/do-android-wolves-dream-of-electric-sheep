            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 118\n- Sheep population: 13.60\n- Wolf population: 44.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.350\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.31 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 12.4% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and while I need to maintain hunting to support wolf reproduction, I must also be cautious not to deplete the sheep too quickly. A moderate increase in hunting intensity allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling the wolf population to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 95.7% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain our wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover if needed. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 96.79, which allows for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This value reflects a balanced approach, allowing us to maintain a sustainable coexistence as we adapt to the current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate hunting approach that balances the needs of both wolves and sheep. This value supports sustainable coexistence while still enabling some hunting to maintain our population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 63.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 59, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both populations can thrive. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that supports coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 50.4% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly. Given the current wolf population, a moderate approach is necessary to ensure long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term survival of both species. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance as the sheep population grows, ensuring that we do not deplete their numbers too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.87, which is only 29.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity and promote a more sustainable balance between our populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.96, which is only 23.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep population too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.79, which is only 18.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support our wolf population without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.38, which is only 15.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that the sheep can recover if I reduce my hunting intensity slightly. By increasing theta to 0.40, I can still maintain some hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow, promoting a more sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.29, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for wolf survival while ensuring the sheep population can stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively low at 12.4% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low at 0.31. This suggests that there is room for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A gradual increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, ensuring both populations can thrive without risking a crash."
