            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and sustain their numbers. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 82.22, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we have enough sheep to sustain our pack without overhunting. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover further while still supporting our wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without overly depleting the sheep population, ensuring long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to ensure that both populations can thrive without depleting resources too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.40 aligns with the wisdom of making small adjustments based on current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.52, which is only 29.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight decrease in theta allows for a focus on competition among wolves while still enabling some hunting, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.36, which is only 23.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for increased hunting intensity without depleting the sheep population too quickly. However, since the wolf population is relatively high at 66, I want to avoid over-hunting and allow for some recovery in both populations. A slight increase to 0.45 allows for sustainable hunting while still considering the long-term balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low relative to the maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. A moderate approach will allow the sheep to recover while preventing overcompetition among wolves. This balance supports long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.30, which is only 15.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for more hunting intensity while still being cautious, as the wolf population is relatively high. This adjustment aims to balance the needs of both species and promote long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.72, which is only 13.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from the previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35, I can still compete effectively with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.33, which is only 12.1% of its maximum capacity. Given the high wolf population of 45, it is wise to focus on reducing competition among wolves rather than intensifying hunting of sheep. This will allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.29, which is only 11.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased slightly, it is crucial to maintain a balance to allow the sheep to recover. A small increase to 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.62, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a balance as the sheep population recovers while also considering the growing wolf population. A gradual increase is essential to ensure sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.98, which is only 10% of its maximum capacity. This indicates a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. By maintaining a moderate theta, I can focus on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.75, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also considering the growing wolf population. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure and promote a sustainable balance."
