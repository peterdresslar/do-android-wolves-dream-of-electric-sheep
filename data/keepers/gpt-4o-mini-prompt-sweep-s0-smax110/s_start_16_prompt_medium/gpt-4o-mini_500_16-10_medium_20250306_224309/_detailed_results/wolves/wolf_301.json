            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to prevent depletion. A theta of 0.60 allows for a balanced approach, ensuring that I can still hunt effectively while giving the sheep a chance to recover and maintain their population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and a moderate hunting intensity will allow for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves. This balance will help prevent over-depletion of the sheep population and allow for gradual adjustments as conditions change.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and while I want to maintain a healthy wolf population, I also need to allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help balance the ecosystem and prevent over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 89.9% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help sustain our wolf population while ensuring that sheep can recover if needed.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 78.3% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate hunting approach. This will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations while avoiding overhunting. As the wolf population is also significant, a slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment reflects a careful balance between ensuring our wolf population thrives while still allowing the sheep to recover and maintain their numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 52.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.85, it is important to maintain a balance that allows for both sheep recovery and wolf population stability. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help ensure sustainable coexistence while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 31.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.50, it is important to maintain a balanced approach to ensure both populations can thrive. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still supporting the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.82, which is only 24.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased slightly to support wolf reproduction, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate increase to 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still recognizing the need for wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.89, which is only 19.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By lowering my hunting intensity slightly, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some sustainable hunting. This will help maintain a balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.58, which is only 16.0% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, a slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted to take advantage of the current sheep availability. However, I must be cautious and avoid overhunting, so I will only make a small adjustment to 0.40 to maintain a balance and allow for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.16, which is only 13.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on the competition with other wolves, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.48, which is only 12.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.14, which is only 11.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are struggling, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to recover while still enabling my pack to compete with other wolves. A gradual approach will help maintain balance and ensure the long-term survival of both species."
