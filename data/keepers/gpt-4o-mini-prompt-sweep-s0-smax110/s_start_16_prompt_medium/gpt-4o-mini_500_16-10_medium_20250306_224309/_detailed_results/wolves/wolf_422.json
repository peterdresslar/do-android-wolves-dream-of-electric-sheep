With a high sheep-to-wolf ratio, focusing on competition among wolves will help stabilize our numbers while giving the sheep a chance to rebound.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at its maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition with other wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, which indicates a need for caution in hunting to prevent depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that a slight increase in hunting intensity is appropriate to maintain balance. However, I must be cautious not to overhunt, as the wolf population is relatively stable. A gradual increase allows for sustainable coexistence while ensuring the wolf pack remains healthy.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is close to its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sustainable coexistence. A gradual increase helps maintain balance as both populations fluctuate.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 88.5% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep. This moderate adjustment helps ensure that both populations can thrive without risking depletion.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of my ancestors, promoting balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 49.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 68, which is relatively high, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for a balanced approach that supports both sheep recovery and wolf population stability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 38.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.60, it is crucial to maintain a balance that allows for the sheep to recover while also ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will help sustain both populations without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.45, which is only 29.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need to adapt to the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.33, which is only 23.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I need to maintain some hunting to support the wolf population, I should focus on a balanced approach to allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease from my previous theta of 0.450 will help ensure sustainability while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.32, which is only 18.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I need to maintain some hunting to support wolf reproduction, I should be cautious not to overhunt and risk depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a more balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.62, which is only 15.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 strikes a balance between competing with other wolves and allowing the sheep population to stabilize, ensuring long-term survival for both species."
