            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 46.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population being relatively high, a moderate theta allows for a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring both populations can thrive without depleting resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the wolf population is relatively high. A moderate hunting intensity will allow for some sheep recovery while also preventing overcompetition among wolves. This approach supports long-term coexistence and avoids drastic changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level (28.4% of maximum capacity), and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are not enough sheep to support aggressive hunting. A moderate approach will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to thrive without overexploiting the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.10, which is only 22.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help balance the ecosystem and prevent over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.82, which is only 18.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need to adapt to the current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.83, which is only 16.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.4 to 0.35, I can maintain a focus on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring that both populations can stabilize and thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.50, which is only 14.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased slightly, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate increase to 0.40 allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still being mindful of the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.87, which is only 12.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting approach. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support our wolf population without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.96, which is only 11.8% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, a slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted to take advantage of the current sheep availability without risking their long-term survival. This moderate adjustment allows for a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.21, which is only 11.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.74, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking immediate depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a balance as the sheep population recovers while also considering the growing wolf population. A gradual increase is essential to avoid sudden shifts that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.58, which is only 10.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize while still maintaining a presence in hunting. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.45, which is only 10.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I need to maintain a focus on hunting to support wolf reproduction, I must also be cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.50, which is only 10.5% of its maximum capacity. A lower theta allows for more competition among wolves, which can help stabilize our population while giving sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.55, which is only 10.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while we need to hunt to sustain our population, we should do so cautiously to allow the sheep to recover.
