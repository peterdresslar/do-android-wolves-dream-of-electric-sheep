            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to prevent depletion. A theta of 0.55 allows for a balanced approach, enabling some hunting while still considering the long-term sustainability of both sheep and wolves. This adjustment reflects a cautious response to the current high sheep population and the need to avoid overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. A moderate theta will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can stabilize, which is crucial for the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover and maintain a sustainable balance. This lower theta will help prevent over-depletion of the sheep while allowing for competition among wolves.",

With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.80, it is essential to maintain a balance that allows for sustainable coexistence. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help the sheep recover while ensuring that the wolf population remains healthy.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment reflects a balance between ensuring the wolf population remains healthy while allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual increase helps maintain stability in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 29.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 70, it is wise to maintain a cautious approach to hunting to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight reduction in hunting intensity allows for a sustainable balance while still enabling wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.33, which is only 23.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover.
