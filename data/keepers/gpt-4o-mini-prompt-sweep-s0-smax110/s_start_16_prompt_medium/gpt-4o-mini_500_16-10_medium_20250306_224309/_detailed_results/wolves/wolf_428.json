            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A theta of 0.5 strikes a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. With a high sheep-to-wolf ratio and a growing wolf population, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance while still considering the need for wolf population sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that we should be cautious in our hunting to avoid depleting their numbers too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a bit more hunting to support our wolf population while still prioritizing the sustainability of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population also present, I must be cautious not to overhunt. A gradual increase to 0.45 allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy, and while it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 85.75, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports the wolf population's growth without overly depleting the sheep, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, but the wolf population is also significant. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling wolves to thrive. This approach maintains a balance and avoids depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and while it is important to maintain a healthy wolf population, I need to ensure that the sheep have the opportunity to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow for better coexistence and prevent over-depletion of the sheep, which is crucial for long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.45, which is only 29.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I need to maintain some hunting to support my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.33, which is only 23.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.45 to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, focusing on sustainable coexistence while still considering the need for wolf population health.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.32, which is only 18.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a moderate increase in hunting intensity is appropriate to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep further. A gradual increase to 0.45 allows for a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting coexistence while being mindful of the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.62, which is only 15.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to allow the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack without depleting the sheep further, promoting a balance that can lead to long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.54, which is only 13.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly."
