            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at maximum capacity, indicating that they can sustain a higher hunting intensity without immediate risk of depletion. However, given the relatively high wolf population, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure long-term survival for both species. A moderate increase in hunting intensity allows for a balance that supports wolf reproduction while still considering the health of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. A moderate theta value will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This approach helps maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 89.9% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support the wolf population without risking a rapid decline in the sheep numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 86.15, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are enough sheep to sustain our hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. A slight reduction from my previous theta allows for a more cautious approach, ensuring that we maintain a balance as the wolf population grows.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This will help support wolf reproduction while still maintaining a healthy sheep population. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 52.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With the wolf population at 67.00, I need to be cautious about increasing hunting intensity too much, as it could lead to a depletion of sheep and ultimately harm both populations. A slight decrease in theta allows for a more balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing the sheep to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will support the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 31.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 69, a higher theta could lead to overhunting and potential depletion of the sheep. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a more balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.82, which is only 24.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.89, which is only 19.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to allow for recovery. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.58, which is only 16.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the immediate needs of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.16, which is only 13.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 represents a slight increase in hunting intensity compared to my previous value, which aligns with the need to adapt to the current conditions without overexploiting the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.48, which is only 12.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly."
