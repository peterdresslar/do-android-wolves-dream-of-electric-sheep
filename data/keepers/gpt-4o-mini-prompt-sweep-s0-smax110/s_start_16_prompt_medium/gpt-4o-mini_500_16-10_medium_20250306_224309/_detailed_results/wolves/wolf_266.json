However, with the wolf population at 69, I need to be cautious not to overhunt and deplete the sheep too quickly. A moderate increase to 0.40 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term balance between both populations.",

To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting sheep.

A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach that promotes coexistence without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.54, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between ensuring wolf reproduction and allowing the sheep population to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.94, which is only 10.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support our wolf population without further depleting the sheep, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.49, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance as the sheep population recovers while also considering the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain our numbers without depleting the sheep too quickly, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.67, which is only 12.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting a lower theta, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize while ensuring our wolf pack remains healthy.
