            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 118\n- Sheep population: 13.60\n- Wolf population: 44.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.400\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.31 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 12.4% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and while I want to maintain a healthy wolf population, I also need to ensure that the sheep can recover. A moderate hunting intensity allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and while it is important to maintain hunting for reproduction, I must also be cautious not to deplete the sheep too quickly. A moderate approach allows for sustainable coexistence while keeping an eye on both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 88% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity. This will help maintain a sustainable balance while also considering the growing wolf population. A slight reduction from my previous theta allows for adaptation to the current conditions without risking over-depletion of sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 76.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep. However, with the wolf population at 52.00, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment reflects a balance between ensuring wolf reproduction and allowing the sheep population to recover. It is a small, gradual change that aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to ensure that both populations can thrive without depleting resources too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population also being relatively high, I want to avoid overhunting and ensure that both populations can thrive. A gradual increase in theta will help maintain balance without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.87, which is only 29.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our wolf population. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance and prevent over-depletion of the sheep, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.96, which is only 23.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the immediate needs of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.79, which is only 18.9% of its maximum capacity. While I want to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I also recognize the need to allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, allowing for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.38, which is only 15.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.4 to 0.35, I can still maintain some hunting activity while prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of avoiding sudden changes and responding to the current state of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.29, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.60, which is only 12.4% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure my hunting is effective for the survival of my pack, I must also allow the sheep population to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the long-term balance between both populations."
