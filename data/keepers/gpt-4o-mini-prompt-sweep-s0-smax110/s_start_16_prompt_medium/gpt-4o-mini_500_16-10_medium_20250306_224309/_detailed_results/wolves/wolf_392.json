            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep. A gradual adjustment is essential to ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still maintaining a balance that prevents over-depletion of the sheep population. A gradual increase is prudent given the current dynamics.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for some hunting without risking depletion. Given the wolf population is also relatively high, a slight reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and promote coexistence while still allowing for some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still ensuring that the sheep population can recover and thrive. A gradual increase is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.52, which is only 29.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is some room for hunting, it is crucial to avoid overexploitation. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.36, which is only 23.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.32, which is only 18.5% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.30, which is only 15.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.72, which is only 13.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should prioritize allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 reflects a slight increase in hunting compared to my previous value, allowing for some reproduction among wolves while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.33, which is only 12.1% of its maximum capacity. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.30, it is crucial to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population. By maintaining a lower theta, I can reduce hunting intensity and promote a sustainable balance, ensuring both populations can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.29, which is only 11.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be slightly increased to support wolf reproduction, it is crucial to avoid overhunting to allow the sheep population to recover. A gradual increase to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while being mindful of the delicate ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.62, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for gradual hunting to help sustain my pack without depleting the sheep too quickly. By increasing theta slightly from 0.35 to 0.40, I can strike a balance between hunting and allowing the sheep population to recover, while also considering the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.98, which is only 10.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover rather than intensifying hunting. A moderate theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can grow, supporting long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.75, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can reduce competition among wolves and give the sheep a chance to rebound, while still being mindful of the wolf population dynamics.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.85, which is only 9.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should be cautious with our hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will help maintain a balance between hunting and allowing the sheep population to stabilize, while also considering the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.95, which is only 10.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, ensuring that I do not over-deplete the sheep while still focusing on the needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.03, which is only 10% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.37, which is only 10.3% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to take advantage of the available prey while still being cautious about the wolf population, which is at 16.00. A moderate increase to 0.40 will help maintain a balance, allowing for sustainable coexistence while avoiding overhunting."
