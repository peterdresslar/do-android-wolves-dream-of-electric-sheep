            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition with other wolves. A gradual increase from my previous theta will help maintain balance without causing sudden population crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to depletion of their numbers. A moderate approach allows for some hunting while giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers, jeopardizing the long-term survival of both species. Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at its maximum capacity, and while I need to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By focusing more on competing with other wolves, I can help maintain a balance in the ecosystem while ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and while I want to increase hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that considers both the current state and the need for sustainable coexistence.",

This adjustment reflects the need to respond to the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the sheep population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 52.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 67, which is relatively high compared to the sheep, I need to be cautious. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while also ensuring that the sheep population can recover and maintain balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 69, I need to be cautious about overhunting. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still supporting the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population also being relatively high, it's important to avoid overhunting to prevent future crashes. A gradual increase to 0.45 allows for better balance while still considering the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.82, which is only 24.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is potential for recovery if I reduce my hunting intensity. By maintaining a moderate theta, I can balance the need to hunt for sustenance while allowing the sheep population to recover, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.89, which is only 19.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring a balanced approach that supports both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.58, which is only 16.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further.
