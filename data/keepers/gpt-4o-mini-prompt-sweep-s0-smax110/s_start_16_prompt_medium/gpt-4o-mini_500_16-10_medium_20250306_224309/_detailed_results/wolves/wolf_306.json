            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 329\n- Sheep population: 11.41\n- Wolf population: 36.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.400\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.32 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 10.4% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and while we can afford to hunt, it's important to maintain a balance to prevent over-depletion. A moderate increase in hunting intensity allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling our pack to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 98.92, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This balance helps maintain a sustainable ecosystem without risking a rapid decline in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support the wolf population without risking a significant depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 65.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with a wolf population of 60, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both populations can thrive. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, focusing on coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing sheep to recover. It reflects a balanced approach, responding to the current conditions and trends.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.7% of its maximum capacity, which indicates that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both populations can thrive. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, focusing on coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A gradual increase is necessary to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring long-term balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.82, which is only 24.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should maintain a moderate hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while also ensuring that our wolf population remains healthy. A theta of 0.40 strikes a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.89, which is only 19.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is an opportunity to hunt, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This balanced approach helps maintain the ecosystem",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.58, which is only 16.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still being cautious. This adjustment will help maintain a balance between the wolf and sheep populations, ensuring sustainable coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.48, which is only 12.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.400 to 0.35, I can focus on a balanced approach that allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term survival of both species. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.14, which is only 11.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to help sustain the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.41, which is only 10.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to gradually increase while maintaining a sustainable wolf population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of making small adjustments and responding to the current state of the ecosystem."
