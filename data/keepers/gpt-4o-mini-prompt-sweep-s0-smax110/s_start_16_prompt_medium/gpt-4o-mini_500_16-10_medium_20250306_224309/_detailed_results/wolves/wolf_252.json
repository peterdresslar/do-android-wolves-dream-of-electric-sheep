            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 84.3% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep do not become over-depleted. A gradual approach is essential to maintain balance and avoid drastic changes that could lead to instability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain our wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual approach is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly, and this theta reflects a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still ensuring their recovery. This moderate adjustment helps maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep, promoting long-term survival for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting approach. This will help maintain the balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring both can thrive without depleting resources too quickly. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid sudden population crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and while it is important to maintain a healthy wolf population, I need to ensure that the sheep have a chance to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow for a more sustainable balance, promoting the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 29.08, which is only 26.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without risking depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 allows for more effective hunting while still considering the need for balance as the wolf population is relatively high at 69. I aim to maintain a gradual approach to ensure both populations can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.28, which is only 21.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure and promote a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.07, which is only 17.3% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking the depletion of the sheep population. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competing with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.50, which is only 15.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the immediate needs of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.23, which is only 12.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to allow the sheep to recover while still ensuring the wolf population remains stable. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the long-term balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.01, which is only 11.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach that acknowledges the need for both wolves and sheep to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.86, which is only 10.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 reflects a balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population. This way, I can ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity slightly to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both the sheep and the wolf population while still competing effectively with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.69, which is only 9.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing our own wolf population. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure on the sheep, giving them a chance to increase in number, while also allowing us to compete with other wolves without depleting our prey too quickly."
