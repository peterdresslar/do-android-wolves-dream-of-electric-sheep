            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and my previous theta was already low. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity slightly while allowing the sheep to recover. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species and prevents overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that we can afford to increase our hunting intensity slightly without risking a rapid depletion of their numbers. A moderate increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 93.7% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 41.00, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 91.68, allowing for a moderate hunting approach. This will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep. Gradually adjusting my hunting intensity will support sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to ensure that both populations can thrive without depleting resources too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 42.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 70, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on the balance needed for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 31.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 71, it is important to avoid overhunting to allow both populations to stabilize. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance while still allowing for some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.44, which is only 24.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased slightly to support wolf reproduction, it is essential to avoid overhunting to allow the sheep population to recover. A moderate increase to 0.45 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for wolf survival with the sustainability of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.23, which is only 18.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is some opportunity for hunting, it is crucial to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring both populations can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.96, which is only 15.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support our wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing our needs.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.36, which is only 13.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for sustenance with the importance of not depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.78, which is only 11.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover rather than intensifying hunting. By maintaining a lower theta, we can prioritize competition with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem."
