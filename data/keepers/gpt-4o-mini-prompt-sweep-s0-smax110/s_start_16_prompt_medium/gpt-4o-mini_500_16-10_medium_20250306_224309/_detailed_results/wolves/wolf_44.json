            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 54\n- Sheep population: 12.21\n- Wolf population: 34.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.400\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.36 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 11.1% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while ensuring that we do not deplete their numbers too quickly. This adjustment reflects a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction without risking the sustainability of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 93.30, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to maintain balance, as the wolf population is also significant. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for competition among wolves while still enabling sustainable hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 59.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. A moderate hunting intensity will allow for sustainable coexistence while also considering the current wolf population. This adjustment helps maintain balance without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment reflects the need to balance the wolf population growth while ensuring the sheep can recover. A gradual increase helps maintain sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the wolf population is relatively high. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain their numbers. This approach supports a balanced ecosystem without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.21, which is only 28.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is an opportunity to hunt, I should be cautious not to over-deplete the sheep. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This balanced approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining sustainable cycles.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low relative to the maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. A moderate approach allows for some hunting while giving sheep a chance to recover. This balance helps ensure the long-term survival of both species without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.82, which is only 18.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery. It\u2019s important to make gradual adjustments to maintain the delicate balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.83, which is only 16.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep further, promoting a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.50, which is only 14.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is a need for a cautious approach to hunting to allow the sheep to recover. By increasing theta slightly to 0.40, I can maintain a balance that supports the wolf population while still allowing for some hunting, promoting sustainability without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.87, which is only 12.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support our wolf population, but it also prioritizes the sustainability of the sheep, ensuring that we do not deplete their numbers further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.96, which is only 11.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.21, which is only 11.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover rather than intensifying hunting.
