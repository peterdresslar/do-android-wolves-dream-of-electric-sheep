            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.00, which is only 14.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is some room for hunting, it is important to avoid overexploitation. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, enabling us to maintain our wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf reproduction and sheep recovery, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and while it is important to maintain a balance for the wolves, I need to ensure that the sheep can recover. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while also giving sheep the chance to increase their numbers, which is crucial for the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.57, which is only 16.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight reduction in hunting intensity allows for a more sustainable balance, giving sheep a chance to recover while still enabling the wolf population to thrive."
