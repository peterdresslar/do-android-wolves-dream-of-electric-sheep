            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 327\n- Sheep population: 13.48\n- Wolf population: 46.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.400\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.29 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 12.3% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. A moderate approach will help maintain a balance between the wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover and maintain their numbers. This approach also helps to stabilize the wolf population by reducing competition among wolves, ensuring our long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that they can sustain a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. A moderate increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the health of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still healthy at 89.9% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 44, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 86.15, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are enough sheep to sustain a moderate hunting approach. By slightly lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while still ensuring the wolf population remains stable. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment reflects a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the health of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 52.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep. However, with the wolf population at 67.00, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term survival of both species. This adjustment reflects a balanced approach, considering the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need to avoid over-depleting the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 31.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 69, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still providing enough resources for the wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.82, which is only 24.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.40 to 0.45, I can help ensure the wolf population remains healthy while still allowing the sheep to recover over time.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.89, which is only 19.0% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, allowing for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.58, which is only 16.0% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.16, which is only 13.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.48, which is only 12.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the long-term sustainability of the sheep population."
