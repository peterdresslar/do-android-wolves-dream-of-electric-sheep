            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. A moderate hunting intensity will allow for some sheep population control while giving them a chance to recover and ensuring our wolf pack remains healthy. This balance is crucial for long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and a slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain the balance without depleting the sheep too quickly. This moderate adjustment allows for sustainable coexistence while also considering the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 88.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 2.16, it is important to maintain a balance to avoid over-depleting the sheep. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for sustainable hunting while still being cautious of the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a sustainable balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly, considering the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need for gradual changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations while ensuring the long-term survival of both species. A theta of 0.55 reflects a cautious approach, allowing for sustainable coexistence as I respond to the current trends.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 49.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 68, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level (38.0% of maximum capacity), and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are not enough sheep to support a higher hunting intensity without risking depletion. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a more balanced approach, enabling sheep to recover while still permitting some hunting to sustain the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 29.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 70, which is relatively high, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain a healthy population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.33, which is only 23% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for gradual hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.32, which is only 18.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a more balanced approach to hunting while still being cautious about the wolf population growth.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.62, which is only 15.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population and maintaining a balance with the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.54, which is only 13.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.90, which is only 11.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a lower hunting intensity is necessary to allow the sheep to recover. Additionally, with the wolf population at 45.00, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively low at 12.02, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring our long-term survival while still being cautious about overhunting."
