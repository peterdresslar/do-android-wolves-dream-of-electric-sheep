            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 95.7% of maximum capacity, allowing for some increased hunting intensity without risking depletion. However, I want to avoid over-hunting as the wolf population is also significant. A moderate increase in hunting will help maintain our population while ensuring the sheep can recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 88.0% of maximum capacity, allowing for some increased hunting intensity without risking depletion. However, I want to avoid drastic changes, so a moderate increase from my previous theta of 0.850 to 0.75 allows for sustainable hunting while considering the current wolf population and the need for balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 63.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with the wolf population at 59, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 50.4% of its maximum capacity, which suggests there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population being relatively high, I need to balance hunting intensity to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while still enabling sheep recovery and maintaining a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 38.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 68, I need to be cautious about overhunting. A slight decrease in hunting intensity allows for a sustainable balance, enabling both sheep and wolves to thrive without depleting resources too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.87, which is only 29.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I need to maintain some hunting to support wolf reproduction, I should also be cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still being mindful of the need for sustainable cycles.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.96, which is only 23.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate increase to 0.40 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population and maintaining a balance with the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.79, which is only 18.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.38, which is only 15.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to allow for recovery. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the competition with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.29, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still being mindful of the need to compete with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.60, which is only 12.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a sustainable hunting strategy. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still enabling some hunting to support our population.",
