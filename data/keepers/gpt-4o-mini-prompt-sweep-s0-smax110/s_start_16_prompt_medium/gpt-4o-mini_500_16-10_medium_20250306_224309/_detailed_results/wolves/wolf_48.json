            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 93.30, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are enough sheep to sustain the wolf population without overhunting. By maintaining a moderate hunting intensity, I can ensure the long-term survival of both species while allowing for some recovery of the sheep population as the wolf numbers grow.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 72.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with the wolf population at 56, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both species can thrive. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition among wolves, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a balance as the sheep population is still below maximum capacity, while also considering the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, and while it is beneficial to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must also be cautious of the growing wolf population. A theta of 0.40 allows for a balanced approach that promotes coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a balance as the sheep population grows, while also considering the current wolf population, which is relatively high. A gradual increase in theta allows for adaptation to changing conditions without causing sudden shifts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 28.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.46, it is important to maintain a balance that allows for the sheep to recover while also ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help sustain both populations without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.82, which is only 18.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. By lowering my theta to 0.35, I can focus more on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring a sustainable balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.83, which is only 16.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach while still being mindful of the need to maintain sustainable cycles.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.50, which is only 14.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, ensuring that we do not deplete the sheep further while still competing with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.87, which is only 12.6% of its maximum capacity. Given the high wolf population of 43, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.96, which is only 11.8% of its maximum capacity. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a more balanced approach to hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment helps ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, maintaining a sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.21, which is only 11.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the immediate needs of my pack.",

This suggests that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack but prioritizes the long-term balance and health of both populations.",
