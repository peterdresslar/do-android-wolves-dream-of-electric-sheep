            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 38.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with a wolf population of 69, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is low, suggesting that if I increase hunting intensity too much, it could lead to a rapid decline in sheep numbers. A theta of 0.25 allows for a gradual increase in hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
