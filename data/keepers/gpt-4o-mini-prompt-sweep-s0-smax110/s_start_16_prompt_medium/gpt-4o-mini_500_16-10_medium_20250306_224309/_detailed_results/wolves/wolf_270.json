            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 273\n- Sheep population: 18.67\n- Wolf population: 6.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.400\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 3.11 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 17.0% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

This suggests that while there is room for some hunting to support wolf reproduction, I need to be cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate increase to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 29.08, which is only 26.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for gradual hunting without risking depletion. However, with a wolf population of 69.00, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting both wolf reproduction and sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.28, which is only 21.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.07, which is only 17.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a presence in the hunting cycle. A moderate theta of 0.35 will help balance our need for sustenance with the necessity of ensuring the sheep population can rebound, thus supporting long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.50, which is only 15.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is potential for recovery in the sheep population. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly to 0.40, I can still support my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.23, which is only 12.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
