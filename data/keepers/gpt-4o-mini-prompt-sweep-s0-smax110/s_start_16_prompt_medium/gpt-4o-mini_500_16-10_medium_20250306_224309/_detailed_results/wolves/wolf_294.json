            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for sheep recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance while still considering the health of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover and ensures the long-term survival of both species. It also helps to stabilize the wolf population as we focus on competition with other wolves.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I will focus on competing with other wolves rather than intensifying hunting. This will allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a healthy balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and while I need to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is close to its maximum capacity, indicating that we should be cautious with our hunting intensity to avoid depleting their numbers too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a bit more hunting to support our wolf population while still maintaining a balance that promotes coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, but I want to ensure that we do not overhunt them as the wolf population is also significant. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow for a more sustainable balance, giving sheep a chance to recover while still allowing for some hunting to support our pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still maintaining a healthy sheep population.

A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to thrive in the long term.",

However, with the wolf population at 69, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure our long-term survival. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for more hunting while still maintaining a balance.",

Given the current wolf population, a slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance while allowing the sheep to recover and ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",

A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still being mindful of the need to avoid overhunting.",
