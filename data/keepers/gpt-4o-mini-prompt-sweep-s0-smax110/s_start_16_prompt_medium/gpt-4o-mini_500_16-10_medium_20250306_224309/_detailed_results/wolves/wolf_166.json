            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 185\n- Sheep population: 12.78\n- Wolf population: 47.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.350\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.27 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 11.6% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. This lower theta will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem, ensuring the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep while preventing overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and a slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain the balance without depleting the sheep too quickly. This moderate adjustment allows for sustainable coexistence while also supporting the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 93.7% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 41, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 83.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with a wolf population of 50, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is still relatively high at 1.83, suggesting that I should maintain a balanced approach to avoid over-depleting the sheep. A theta of 0.55 allows for increased hunting intensity while still promoting coexistence and sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 70% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.31, it is essential to maintain a balance that allows for sustainable coexistence. A moderate theta of 0.45 reflects a cautious approach to hunting, allowing for some reproduction among wolves while still enabling the sheep population to recover and thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both species. This adjustment reflects the need to balance the growing wolf population with the available sheep, ensuring we do not over-deplete their numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. It",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 31.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 71.00, it is wise to maintain a slightly lower hunting intensity to allow for sustainable coexistence and prevent over-depletion of the sheep. This moderate adjustment will help balance the needs of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.44, which is only 24.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly, aligning with the wisdom of gradual adjustments.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.23, which is only 18.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is some room for hunting, I need to be cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population and maintaining a balance with the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.96, which is only 15.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach to hunting while still being mindful of the wolf population, which is currently at 59. I aim to maintain a healthy dynamic between both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.36, which is only 13.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to recover while still enabling the wolf population to compete effectively. Gradually adjusting to 0.35 reflects a cautious approach to ensure sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we are competing for limited resources. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help sustain our population while allowing the sheep to recover gradually. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem."
