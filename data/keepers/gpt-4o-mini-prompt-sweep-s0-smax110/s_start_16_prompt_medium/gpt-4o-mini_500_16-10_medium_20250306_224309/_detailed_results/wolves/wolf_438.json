            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 470\n- Sheep population: 12.02\n- Wolf population: 40.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.300\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.30 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 10.9% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This value strikes a balance between ensuring our wolf population can thrive while still allowing the sheep to recover and maintain their numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that can support wolf reproduction while still enabling the sheep to recover. This balance helps maintain the ecosystem",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 78.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with a wolf population of 53, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicating a slight competition for resources, a moderate theta will help maintain the sheep population while ensuring the wolf pack remains healthy. This adjustment allows for sustainable coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 41.82, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A slight decrease from my previous theta will help balance the competition among wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.45, which is only 29.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I can increase my hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. A small increase to 0.45 allows for a balanced approach that promotes coexistence while still considering the need for wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.33, which is only 23.0% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.450 will help maintain a balance, allowing for some hunting while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.32, which is only 18.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.62, which is only 15.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.54, which is only 13.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while maintaining a sustainable wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support our needs without depleting the sheep further, promoting a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.90, which is only 11.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves and allow the sheep population to stabilize. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.02, which is only 10.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should be cautious with our hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring both populations can thrive in the long term."
