            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at its maximum capacity, and maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover and prevents overexploitation. This approach also helps stabilize the wolf population as we compete with each other. Gradual adjustments are key to ensuring long-term survival for both species.",

Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover and ensures the long-term survival of both species. It is crucial to focus on competition with other wolves at this stage to stabilize our population before considering any increase in hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A small increase to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach that considers both the current sheep population and the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is close to its maximum capacity, indicating that we can afford to increase our hunting intensity slightly without risking depletion. However, given the current wolf population, a moderate increase allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling us to maintain our numbers.",

This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still ensuring that the sheep population can recover and maintain balance. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the fact that the sheep population is at 78% of its maximum capacity, a gradual increase in hunting intensity is appropriate to foster coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that while there are enough sheep for hunting, we should avoid overexploitation. A moderate theta allows for continued hunting while ensuring that the sheep population can recover and thrive, promoting long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at nearly 50% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population also being relatively high, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while still considering the long-term health of both populations.",

A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help balance the ecosystem and ensure sustainable coexistence.",

This suggests that while I can increase my hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A theta of 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of my pack.",
