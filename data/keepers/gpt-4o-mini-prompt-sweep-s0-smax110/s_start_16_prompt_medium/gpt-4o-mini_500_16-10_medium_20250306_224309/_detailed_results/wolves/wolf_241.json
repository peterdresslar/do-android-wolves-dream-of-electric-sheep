            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 257\n- Sheep population: 11.86\n- Wolf population: 38.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.400\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.31 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 10.8% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 93.9% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that can sustain both sheep and wolf populations. This balance will help ensure long-term survival while avoiding over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 84.3% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 48, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance of the ecosystem. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to ensure that both sheep and wolf populations can thrive without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can still recover and thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight reduction in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a balance between the wolf and sheep populations while still allowing for some hunting to support our reproduction. Gradually adjusting my theta downwards will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that can support both populations sustainably.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 29.08, which is only 26.4% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still competing with other wolves. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.28, which is only 21.2% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to help sustain the wolf population while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep too quickly. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.35 aligns with the wisdom of making small adjustments based on current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.07, which is only 17.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to allow the sheep population to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring a balance that promotes long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.50, which is only 15.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.23, which is only 12.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting a lower theta, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the wolf population is relatively high. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help sustain our pack while allowing the sheep to recover gradually. This adjustment is small and aligns with the need for a balanced approach to ensure long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.86, which is only 10.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting without depleting the sheep further, while also considering the growing wolf population."
