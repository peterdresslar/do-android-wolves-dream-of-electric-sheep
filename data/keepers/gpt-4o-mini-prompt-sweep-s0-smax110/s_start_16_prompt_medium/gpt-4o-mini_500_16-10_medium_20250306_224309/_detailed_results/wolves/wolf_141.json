            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 106.04, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 5.00, I must be cautious not to overhunt, as this could lead to a depletion of sheep and ultimately harm our long-term survival. A theta of 0.76 allows for sustainable hunting while still considering the need to maintain a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to prevent depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still considering the sustainability of the sheep population. This balance helps maintain both populations over the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and while I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.40 will help balance hunting with competition among wolves, promoting sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. A moderate approach will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term survival for both.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while giving sheep a chance to rebound.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively low. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover and prevents overexploitation, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem. This approach also helps to mitigate competition among wolves as we adapt to the current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in sheep numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition with other wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover and ensures the long-term survival of both species. It also helps to stabilize the wolf population as we adapt to the current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery. Maintaining a lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, preventing overhunting and allowing for a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid depletion of their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover while also managing competition with other wolves. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both populations.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at its maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery and prevent depletion. Maintaining a lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, while also allowing for gradual adjustments in response to future population changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery. Maintaining a lower theta helps ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, as it reduces pressure on the sheep population while we focus on competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that we should be cautious with our hunting to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta reflects a balanced approach, allowing for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both sheep and wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 4.23, it is crucial to focus on competition among wolves to prevent overhunting and ensure long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at its maximum capacity, and while I need to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and a slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance while still allowing for some recovery of the sheep. This adjustment is gradual, aligning with the wisdom of avoiding sudden changes, and it supports the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 93.7% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support the wolf population without risking a rapid decline in sheep numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 91.68, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we have enough sheep to sustain our pack without overhunting. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover further while still supporting our wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 70% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring both can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the balance between wolves and sheep. This adjustment will help maintain a sustainable coexistence as the sheep population is recovering, and it allows for gradual adaptation to the current conditions without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual increase is prudent to avoid sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 31.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for gradual hunting without risking depletion. However, with the wolf population at 71, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.44, which is only 24.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly, considering the current dynamics."
