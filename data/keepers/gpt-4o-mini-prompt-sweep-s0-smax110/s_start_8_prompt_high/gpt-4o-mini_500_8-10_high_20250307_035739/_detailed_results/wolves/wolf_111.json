            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 42.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, suggesting that I should be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance while allowing the sheep population to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments to ensure long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 42.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, suggesting that I should not increase hunting intensity too aggressively. A slight increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still enabling the sheep population to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, a moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain our wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. This gradual adjustment allows for a balance that supports both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 41.2% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating a need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A moderate adjustment will help sustain both populations.",

A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for a slight focus on competition with other wolves while still enabling some hunting of sheep, promoting a sustainable balance as both populations adjust.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 41.0% of maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, suggesting that I should be cautious and not overhunt. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting intensity while still prioritizing the balance needed for both populations.",

However, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, suggesting that I should focus more on competing with other wolves to ensure our population remains stable. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population.",
