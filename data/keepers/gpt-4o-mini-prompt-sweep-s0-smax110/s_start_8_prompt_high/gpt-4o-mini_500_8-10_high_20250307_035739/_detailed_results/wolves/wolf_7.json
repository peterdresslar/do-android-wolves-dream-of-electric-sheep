            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 11\n- Sheep population: 18.44\n- Wolf population: 3.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.300\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 6.15 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 16.8% of maximum capacity\n\nEcosystem observations:\n- The wolf population is relatively low, which may present opportunities for growth.\n- Sheep numbers are becoming concerning, suggesting caution may be needed.\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. This cautious approach will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while I want to allow for some hunting to support wolf reproduction, I need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while being cautious of overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while I want to ensure the wolf population can grow, I need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also considering the growth potential of the wolf population. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still concerningly high, and while my pack is small, I need to focus on maintaining a balance. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and ensures that we do not deplete the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity to ensure the wolf population can grow, I must do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A small increase from my previous theta allows for a more balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the rising sheep numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, indicating a need for caution in hunting. A moderate theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while also giving sheep a chance to recover. This approach helps maintain a balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high relative to the wolf population, and a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our own numbers.
