A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while being cautious about the sheep's sustainability.",

By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for long-term sustainability."
