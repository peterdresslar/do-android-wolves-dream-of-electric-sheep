            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 51.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. However, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, suggesting that I should be cautious with hunting intensity. A slight decrease in theta allows for a balanced approach, enabling the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment reflects the need to respond to the decreasing sheep-to-wolf ratio, ensuring that we can sustain our population without over-depleting the sheep.",
