            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 45\n- Sheep population: 34.29\n- Wolf population: 41.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.350\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.84 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 31.2% of maximum capacity\n\nEcosystem observations:\n- The wolf population is quite high, which may lead to increased competition.\n- The ratio of sheep to wolves is becoming less favorable, which may require adaptation.\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is abundant and at 90.2% of its maximum capacity, which allows for more aggressive hunting without risking immediate depletion. The current sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we can sustain increased hunting intensity while still ensuring our long-term survival. This adjustment is gradual, building on my previous theta to maintain balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently abundant at 99.47, which allows for more aggressive hunting without immediately threatening their recovery. Increasing my hunting intensity slightly will help ensure the wolf population can thrive while still keeping an eye on the sustainability of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently abundant, allowing for a more aggressive hunting strategy that can help sustain our wolf population. However, I want to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly, so I am making a moderate adjustment rather than a drastic increase.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, allowing for some hunting intensity while still being mindful of the growing wolf population. A slight decrease from my previous theta will help maintain balance and prevent over-depletion of sheep, ensuring sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population being quite high, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A moderate hunting intensity will help maintain balance, allowing for some hunting while also giving sheep a chance to recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and the need for coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that increased competition among wolves may be necessary. A moderate theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still giving sheep a chance to recover, promoting long-term balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition. With the sheep population at 50.24 and the sheep-to-wolf ratio becoming less favorable, a moderate hunting intensity will allow for some recovery of the sheep while still ensuring the wolves can sustain themselves. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, and a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while we focus on reducing competition among ourselves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low relative to the wolf population, indicating a need for caution in hunting to allow sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance while still allowing for some hunting to support wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition among wolves. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain a balance and ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low relative to the wolf population, and increasing competition among wolves is a concern. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a modest increase in hunting intensity, which can help stabilize the sheep population while still being cautious of overhunting. This approach aligns with the need for balance and sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, and a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while we manage our numbers.
