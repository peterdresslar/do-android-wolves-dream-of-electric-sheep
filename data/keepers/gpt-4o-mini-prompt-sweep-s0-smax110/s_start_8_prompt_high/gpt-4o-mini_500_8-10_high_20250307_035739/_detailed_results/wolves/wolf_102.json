However, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, suggesting that I should be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring the long-term survival of both species while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the wolf population being moderately high and the sheep-to-wolf ratio becoming less favorable, a slight reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain the balance between our populations while still allowing for some reproduction.",

A gradual adjustment allows for sustainable coexistence without risking a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, and the wolf population is relatively high. A slight decrease in hunting intensity allows for better competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover. This approach supports long-term sustainability without risking immediate depletion of sheep.",

A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while still maintaining a sustainable balance. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of gradual changes to ensure long-term survival for both species.",
