            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still reasonably plentiful, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity while also considering the moderately high wolf population. This adjustment helps maintain a balance, ensuring that both sheep and wolves can thrive without depleting resources too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. Given the current high wolf population and the need to avoid overexploitation of the sheep, a balanced approach will help maintain sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the current wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. The sheep population is still relatively healthy, but the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, enabling us to maintain our numbers while giving sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that we need to allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity while still allowing for some hunting, promoting a more sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition among wolves. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that we need to allow the sheep population to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species and promote a more sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, and while I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta will help balance hunting with the need to reduce competition among wolves, promoting a sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition for resources. With the sheep population at 41.70 and the sheep-to-wolf ratio becoming less favorable, it",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition among wolves. The sheep population is at a sustainable level, but the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. By lowering the hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing the competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. The sheep population is at a low percentage of its maximum capacity, so a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we manage our numbers. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will allow for some sheep population control while still giving the sheep a chance to recover. This approach helps maintain a balance between the two populations without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. By focusing on competition rather than intense hunting, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing the wolf numbers sustainably. This gradual adjustment will help maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This cautious approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low at 29.3% of maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A cautious approach with a moderate hunting intensity will allow sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain stability. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable.
