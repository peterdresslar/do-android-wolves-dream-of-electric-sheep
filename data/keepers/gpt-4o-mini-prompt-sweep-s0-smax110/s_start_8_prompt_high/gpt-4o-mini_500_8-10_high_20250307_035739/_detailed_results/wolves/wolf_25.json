            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 35\n- Sheep population: 95.58\n- Wolf population: 23.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.491\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 4.16 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 86.9% of maximum capacity\n\nEcosystem observations:\n- Sheep are very abundant, suggesting potential for more aggressive hunting.\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

Adjust your hunting intensity gradually in response to population changes\n4. Find a balance that creates sustainable cycles rather than crashes\n5.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is abundant, allowing for a more aggressive hunting strategy without risking immediate depletion. A theta of 0.55 strikes a balance between increasing hunting intensity to take advantage of the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, and while the wolf population is moderately high, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and allow for sustainable coexistence, while still enabling some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, but the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A moderate hunting intensity allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves. This approach helps maintain balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition among wolves. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep population to recover. A theta of 0.35 represents a cautious approach that balances the need for hunting with the necessity of maintaining a sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that we need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain the balance while allowing the sheep to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of adapting to changing conditions without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the current wolf population is high, leading to increased competition among wolves. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that we need to allow the sheep population to recover. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species and maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low relative to the wolf population, indicating a need for a cautious approach. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition among wolves. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain balance and ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition among wolves. With the sheep population at only 33% of its maximum capacity, it",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, and with the sheep population at only 31.2% of its maximum capacity, it",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow sheep to recover while still keeping an eye on the wolf population dynamics. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance and prevents overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. A moderate approach will allow for some hunting while giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring the long-term survival of both populations."
