            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 45.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, suggesting that I should be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves to maintain balance.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment helps maintain a balance as the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, ensuring the long-term survival of both populations.",

However, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, suggesting that I need to be cautious about hunting intensity to avoid depleting the sheep population too quickly. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow for a more sustainable balance while still considering the needs of the wolf population.",

However, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, suggesting that I need to be cautious with my hunting intensity. A slight decrease in theta allows for a balanced approach that supports both sheep recovery and wolf population stability.",
