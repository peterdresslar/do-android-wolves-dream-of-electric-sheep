            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still reasonably high, allowing for some increased hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction. However, given the rising wolf population and the need to avoid over-depletion of sheep, a moderate approach is necessary to maintain balance and ensure long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 65, and while the wolf population is high, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A moderate hunting intensity will allow for some reproduction among wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that increased competition among wolves may be necessary. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, enabling sustainable coexistence while still permitting some hunting to support wolf reproduction. This adjustment helps ensure that both populations can thrive without depleting resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition. With the sheep population at a sustainable level, a slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. This balance will help avoid overexploitation of the sheep and ensure long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, and a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while we manage our own numbers. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low relative to the wolf population, and increasing my hunting intensity slightly will help balance the ecosystem without depleting the sheep too quickly. This moderate adjustment allows for sustainable coexistence while also addressing the competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, so a slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while still maintaining a sustainable balance. This moderate approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",

A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This cautious approach ensures the long-term survival of both species and avoids depleting the sheep further.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A lower theta allows for more competition among wolves, which can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment is essential for maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain our population while allowing the sheep to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, so I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A gradual increase to 0.40 allows for better balance while still considering the long-term survival of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that we need to focus more on competing with other wolves to stabilize our population. This lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we adapt to the changing conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable.

However, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, suggesting that I should be cautious about increasing hunting intensity too much.
