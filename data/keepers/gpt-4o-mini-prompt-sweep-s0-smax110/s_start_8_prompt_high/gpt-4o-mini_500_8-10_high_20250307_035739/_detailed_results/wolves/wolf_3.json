            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep population to recover while ensuring the long-term survival of both species. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while I want to allow for some hunting to support wolf reproduction, I must prioritize the recovery of the sheep. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while being cautious not to deplete the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. By focusing on competition with other wolves at this lower intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while ensuring our own numbers remain stable. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
