            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 44\n- Sheep population: 36.25\n- Wolf population: 44.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.300\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.82 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 33.0% of maximum capacity\n\nEcosystem observations:\n- The wolf population is quite high, which may lead to increased competition.\n- The ratio of sheep to wolves is becoming less favorable, which may require adaptation.\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3. Adjust your hunting intensity gradually in response to population changes\n4. Find a balance that creates sustainable cycles rather than crashes\n5.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is abundant and at 90.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that we can increase our hunting intensity without risking immediate depletion. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 9.02, there is ample opportunity for hunting, which can help sustain our wolf population. However, I will adjust it gradually to avoid sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is abundant at 99.47, which allows for a more aggressive hunting strategy without immediately threatening their long-term survival. Increasing my hunting intensity slightly will help ensure the wolf population can thrive while still allowing for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently abundant at 95.58, which indicates a good opportunity for more aggressive hunting. Increasing my hunting intensity slightly will help ensure the wolf population can thrive while still allowing for sustainable sheep numbers. This adjustment is gradual, aligning with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population being moderately high and the sheep-to-wolf ratio becoming less favorable, a gradual adjustment is necessary to ensure sustainable coexistence. This theta strikes a balance between hunting for reproduction and allowing the sheep population to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population being quite high, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A moderate hunting intensity allows for some reproduction while giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that increased competition among wolves is likely. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, enabling some hunting to support wolf reproduction while also giving sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition. With the sheep population at 50.24 and the sheep-to-wolf ratio becoming less favorable, a moderate hunting intensity will allow sheep to recover while still ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, and a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while we focus on maintaining our own numbers. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity, I can help sustain the sheep population while also addressing the growing competition among wolves. This moderate adjustment allows for a balance between hunting and competition, promoting long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, and a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while we adapt to the current conditions. This gradual adjustment helps maintain a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low relative to the wolf population, indicating increased competition among wolves. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a modest hunting effort to help sustain the sheep population while still being cautious to avoid over-depletion. This approach supports a gradual balance between hunting and competition."
