            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. However, the wolf population is high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A theta of 0.65 reflects a balanced approach that supports sustainable coexistence while still allowing for some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 65, but the wolf population is high at 47, leading to increased competition. A moderate theta of 0.55 allows for a balanced approach, enabling some hunting to support reproduction while also considering the need to avoid depleting the sheep population further. This adjustment reflects the current dynamics and aims for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating increased competition among wolves. A moderate hunting intensity will allow for some sheep population recovery while still supporting our wolf pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, and the wolf population is quite high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
