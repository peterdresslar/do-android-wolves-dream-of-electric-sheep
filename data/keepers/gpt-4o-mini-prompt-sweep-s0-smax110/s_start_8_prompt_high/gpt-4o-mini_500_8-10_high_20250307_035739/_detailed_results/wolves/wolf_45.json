            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly, considering the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while still enabling wolves to compete effectively. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",

            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while still maintaining enough pressure to support our reproduction. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments to ensure long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a sustainable balance. This gradual adjustment will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 48.1% of maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. With the wolf population being moderately high, a slight increase in hunting intensity allows for better reproduction while still considering the need for balance. This gradual adjustment helps maintain a healthy ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 47.4% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. Given the moderately high wolf population and the decreasing sheep-to-wolf ratio, a gradual increase to 0.35 will help sustain both populations without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover. This gradual adjustment will promote long-term sustainability for both species."
