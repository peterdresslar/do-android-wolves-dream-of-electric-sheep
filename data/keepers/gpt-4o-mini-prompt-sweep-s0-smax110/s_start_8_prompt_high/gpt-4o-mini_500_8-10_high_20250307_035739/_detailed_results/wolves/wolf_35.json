Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, a slight reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and prevent over-depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, but the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A moderate hunting intensity will allow for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves. This adjustment helps maintain balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition. With the sheep population at 65 and the sheep-to-wolf ratio becoming less favorable, a moderate hunting intensity will help maintain balance. This approach allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while giving sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, and a lower theta will allow the sheep population to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",

The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, and a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while we adapt to the current conditions. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach to hunting while still considering the need for the sheep to recover. This gradual adjustment helps maintain the delicate balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition among wolves. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that we need to allow the sheep population to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species and avoid depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition among wolves. To allow the sheep population to recover and avoid depleting their numbers further, I will focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensifying hunting. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition among wolves. The sheep population is at a low ratio compared to wolves, indicating that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow the sheep to recover.

A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling wolves to maintain their numbers. This approach helps ensure long-term sustainability and prevents overexploitation of the sheep.",

A lower theta allows for more focus on competing with other wolves, which can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
