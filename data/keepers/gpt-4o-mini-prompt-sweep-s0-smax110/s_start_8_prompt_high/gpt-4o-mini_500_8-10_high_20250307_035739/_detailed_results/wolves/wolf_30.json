            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 35\n- Sheep population: 95.58\n- Wolf population: 23.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.472\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 4.16 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 86.9% of maximum capacity\n\nEcosystem observations:\n- Sheep are very abundant, suggesting potential for more aggressive hunting.\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently abundant, allowing for a more aggressive hunting strategy without risking immediate depletion. A theta of 0.55 strikes a balance between increasing hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being mindful of the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, and while the wolf population is moderately high, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and allow for sustainable coexistence, while still enabling some hunting to support wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while also considering the increasing competition among wolves. This adjustment helps maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition among wolves. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that we need to allow the sheep population to recover. By adopting a lower hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, and a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while we manage our numbers more sustainably. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and maintaining a balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support reproduction while still prioritizing the balance needed for both populations to thrive. This gradual adjustment helps avoid over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, and a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while we focus on reducing competition among wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help sustain the sheep population while allowing for some recovery. This gradual adjustment aligns with the need to balance both populations without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the current wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. The sheep population is still recovering, and maintaining a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to stabilize and grow. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level relative to the maximum capacity, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A slight increase in hunting intensity allows for some reproduction among wolves while still giving sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment helps maintain a balance without risking a crash in either population.",
