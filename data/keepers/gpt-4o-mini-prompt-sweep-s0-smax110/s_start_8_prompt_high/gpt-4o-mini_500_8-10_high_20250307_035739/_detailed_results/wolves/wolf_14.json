            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 32\n- Sheep population: 95.57\n- Wolf population: 8.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.079\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 11.95 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 86.9% of maximum capacity\n\nEcosystem observations:\n- The wolf population is relatively low, which may present opportunities for growth.\n- Sheep are very abundant, suggesting potential for more aggressive hunting.\n- There are many sheep per wolf, suggesting the ecosystem could support more hunting.\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 43\n- Sheep population: 38.30\n- Wolf population: 47.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.300\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.81 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 34.8% of maximum capacity\n\nEcosystem observations:\n- The wolf population is quite high, which may lead to increased competition.\n- The ratio of sheep to wolves is becoming less favorable, which may require adaptation.\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3. Adjust your hunting intensity gradually in response to population changes\n4. Find a balance that creates sustainable cycles rather than crashes\n5.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is abundant, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This approach supports the growth of the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is abundant, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we can increase our hunting intensity without jeopardizing the long-term survival of either species. A moderate increase to 0.5 allows for sustainable hunting while still considering the need for balance as wolf numbers grow.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is abundant, allowing for a more aggressive hunting approach without immediately threatening their recovery. This increase will help sustain our wolf population while still being mindful of the need for balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently abundant, allowing for a more aggressive hunting strategy without immediately threatening their recovery. This slight increase from my previous theta reflects the need to capitalize on the current sheep availability while still being mindful of the long-term balance between our populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, but the wolf population is moderately high. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain a sustainable balance, allowing sheep to recover while still supporting wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, but the wolf population is relatively high, leading to increased competition. A moderate hunting intensity allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves. This approach helps maintain balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain their numbers. This approach supports sustainable coexistence and avoids drastic changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition. With the sheep population at 51.4% of maximum capacity, a moderate hunting intensity will allow for some sheep recovery while still enabling wolves to thrive. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition among wolves. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that we need to allow the sheep population to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species and promote a more sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low relative to the wolf population, indicating a need for a cautious approach. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity, I can help sustain the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition among us. The sheep population is also relatively low, so reducing hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we manage our numbers. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition among wolves. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that we need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity, giving sheep a chance to thrive while we manage our own numbers."
