            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 44\n- Sheep population: 36.25\n- Wolf population: 44.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.300\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.82 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 33.0% of maximum capacity\n\nEcosystem observations:\n- The wolf population is quite high, which may lead to increased competition.\n- The ratio of sheep to wolves is becoming less favorable, which may require adaptation.\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3. Adjust your hunting intensity gradually in response to population changes\n4. Find a balance that creates sustainable cycles rather than crashes\n5.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is abundant and at 90.2% of its maximum capacity, allowing for more aggressive hunting without risking immediate depletion. The current sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we can sustain higher hunting intensity while still ensuring our long-term survival. This gradual increase in theta will help us capitalize on the current conditions while remaining mindful of future balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently abundant, allowing for more aggressive hunting without immediate risk of depletion. This will help ensure the wolf population can thrive while still keeping an eye on the balance needed for long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently abundant, allowing for more aggressive hunting without immediate risk of depletion. With the sheep population at 86.9% of its maximum capacity and a favorable sheep-to-wolf ratio, increasing my hunting intensity will help ensure the wolf population thrives while still allowing for sustainable cycles.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. However, the wolf population is moderately high, so I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A theta of 0.80 strikes a balance between ensuring our pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still reasonably plentiful, allowing for some hunting without risking depletion. However, with the wolf population being relatively high, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to maintain balance and ensure long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A moderate hunting intensity will allow us to maintain our numbers while ensuring the sheep can recover and thrive. This balance is crucial for the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, so a moderate hunting intensity will allow for sustainable coexistence while giving the sheep population a chance to recover. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of making gradual changes in response to the current ecosystem state.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition among wolves. The sheep population is also relatively healthy, allowing for a slight reduction in hunting intensity to promote coexistence. This moderate approach will help stabilize both populations and avoid over-depletion of sheep while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, and a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while we focus on maintaining our own numbers. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments to ensure long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low relative to the maximum capacity, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support reproduction while still prioritizing the balance needed for sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition among wolves. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competition with other wolves while ensuring the sheep have a chance to stabilize and grow.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low relative to the wolf population, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a bit more hunting to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep too quickly. This approach aims for a balanced coexistence as we adapt to the current conditions."
