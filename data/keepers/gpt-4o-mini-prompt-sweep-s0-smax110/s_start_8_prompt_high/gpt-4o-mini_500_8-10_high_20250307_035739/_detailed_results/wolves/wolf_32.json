            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still reasonably plentiful, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while avoiding over-depletion of the sheep. This adjustment reflects the need to adapt to the increasing wolf population and the less favorable sheep-to-wolf ratio, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still reasonably plentiful, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population being high, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A moderate hunting intensity will allow for some reproduction while giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, and the wolf population is relatively high. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, allowing sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of making gradual adjustments to ensure long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, so a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while we manage our numbers. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, and a lower theta will allow sheep to recover while we focus on reducing competition among wolves. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level relative to the maximum capacity, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a more balanced approach to hunting while still considering the need to reduce competition among wolves. This adjustment promotes sustainability without risking a rapid decline in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition among wolves. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain a balance and ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low relative to the wolf population, and increasing competition among wolves is likely. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a bit more hunting to support reproduction while still being cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. This approach helps maintain a balance as the sheep population recovers.",
