            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 42\n- Sheep population: 41.70\n- Wolf population: 49.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.300\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.85 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 37.9% of maximum capacity\n\nEcosystem observations:\n- The wolf population is quite high, which may lead to increased competition.\n- The ratio of sheep to wolves is becoming less favorable, which may require adaptation.\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, and the wolf population is low. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will allow for sustainable coexistence while still enabling the wolf population to grow. This approach balances the need for immediate food with the long-term health of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently healthy and can support increased hunting intensity. However, I want to avoid overexploitation, so I am making a moderate adjustment to ensure sustainable coexistence while allowing for potential wolf population growth.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is abundant and at 82.5% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support the growth of the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can still recover and maintain a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is abundant and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we can increase our hunting intensity without jeopardizing the long-term survival of both species. A gradual increase to 0.65 allows for more aggressive hunting while still considering the need for balance as the wolf population grows.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is abundant and at 90.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that we can increase our hunting intensity without risking immediate depletion. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 9.02, there is enough prey to support more aggressive hunting, which will help sustain our wolf population. However, I will adjust gradually to avoid sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is abundant and at 90.4% of its maximum capacity, allowing for more aggressive hunting without immediate risk of depletion. This increase in hunting intensity will help sustain our wolf population by ensuring we have enough food for reproduction, while still being mindful of the need for balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently abundant, allowing for more aggressive hunting without immediate risk of depletion. This will help sustain our wolf population by increasing reproduction rates while still being mindful of the need for balance. A gradual increase in hunting intensity aligns with the current ecosystem state and ensures we maintain a healthy dynamic.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. However, the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A theta of 0.75 strikes a balance between ensuring the survival of both species while allowing for sustainable hunting that does not deplete the sheep population too quickly.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy, but the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A moderate hunting intensity allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves. This approach helps maintain balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still recovering and the wolf population is relatively high, leading to increased competition. A moderate hunting intensity will allow for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves. This approach helps maintain balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition among wolves. The sheep population is also at a moderate level, allowing for some hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and allow both populations to stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition among wolves. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help balance the ecosystem and ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low relative to the wolf population, and increasing competition among wolves could lead to instability. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach aims to maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem."
