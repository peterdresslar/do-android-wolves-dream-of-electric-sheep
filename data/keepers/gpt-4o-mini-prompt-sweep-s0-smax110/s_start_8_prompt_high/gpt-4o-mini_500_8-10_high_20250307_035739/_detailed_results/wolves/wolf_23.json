            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 34\n- Sheep population: 99.47\n- Wolf population: 16.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.786\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 6.22 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 90.4% of maximum capacity\n\nEcosystem observations:\n- Sheep are very abundant, suggesting potential for more aggressive hunting.\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently abundant at 99.47, which allows for a more aggressive hunting strategy without immediately threatening their recovery. Increasing theta to 0.85 will help us capitalize on the current sheep abundance while still being mindful of the need for balance as wolf numbers grow.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently abundant, allowing for more aggressive hunting without immediate risk of depletion. This will help increase our wolf population while still being mindful of the need for balance. A gradual increase in hunting intensity is warranted given the current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. However, the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A theta of 0.75 strikes a balance between ensuring our survival and allowing the sheep population to recover, while also avoiding sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, but the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A moderate hunting intensity will allow us to maintain a sustainable balance while still enabling some reproduction. This approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but with the wolf population being high, it",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that a more moderate hunting intensity is necessary to allow the sheep population to recover while still ensuring the wolves can sustain themselves. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition. With the sheep population at 45.7% of its maximum capacity, a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition among wolves. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that we need to allow the sheep population to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species and avoid depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still recovering and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the balance needed for both populations to thrive. This approach helps to avoid over-depletion of sheep while managing the competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the current wolf population is high, leading to increased competition for resources. The sheep population is still recovering, and maintaining a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to stabilize and grow, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem. This approach aligns with the wisdom of making gradual adjustments to adapt to changing conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, and a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while we manage our numbers. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition among wolves. The sheep population is also relatively low compared to the wolf population, so a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This gradual adjustment will help ensure a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This gradual adjustment will help ensure long-term sustainability for both species."
