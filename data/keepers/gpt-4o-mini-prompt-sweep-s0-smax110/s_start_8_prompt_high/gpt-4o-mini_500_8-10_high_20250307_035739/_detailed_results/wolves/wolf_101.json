A slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain our wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover without depleting their numbers too quickly. This moderate adjustment aligns with the wisdom of gradual changes to ensure long-term survival for both species.",

This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",

The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating the need for a balanced approach to ensure both populations can thrive. A gradual increase to 0.45 allows for adaptation while still prioritizing long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for some hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that I should focus on maintaining a balance rather than intensifying hunting. A slight decrease in theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both species while allowing the sheep population to recover.",

However, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, so a slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted to ensure the wolf population remains healthy without depleting the sheep too quickly. This moderate adjustment allows for a balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep.",

However, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, suggesting that I should prioritize competition with other wolves to ensure our population remains stable.
