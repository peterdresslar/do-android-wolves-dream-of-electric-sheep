A moderate theta allows for some hunting to sustain the wolf population while giving sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term health of both sheep and wolves. This adjustment reflects the need to adapt to the changing sheep-to-wolf ratio, ensuring that we do not over-deplete the sheep while maintaining a sustainable wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a balance as the wolf population is moderately high, and I want to ensure we do not overhunt while still supporting our pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 52.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. However, the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing competition among wolves. This approach supports long-term sustainability and avoids over-depletion of sheep.",

This adjustment acknowledges the growing wolf population while still prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both species.",

However, the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight increase in theta allows for more hunting to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious to avoid depleting the sheep population too quickly.",
