This adjustment will help maintain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep do not become over-depleted. A moderate increase is necessary to support reproduction without risking a crash in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 49.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with a wolf population of 15, I need to be cautious to avoid over-depleting the sheep. A slight reduction from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring both populations can thrive without risking a crash.",
