            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 34\n- Sheep population: 99.47\n- Wolf population: 16.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.234\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 6.22 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 90.4% of maximum capacity\n\nEcosystem observations:\n- Sheep are very abundant, suggesting potential for more aggressive hunting.\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 45\n- Sheep population: 34.29\n- Wolf population: 41.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.350\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.84 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 31.2% of maximum capacity\n\nEcosystem observations:\n- The wolf population is quite high, which may lead to increased competition.\n- The ratio of sheep to wolves is becoming less favorable, which may require adaptation.\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3. Adjust your hunting intensity gradually in response to population changes\n4. Find a balance that creates sustainable cycles rather than crashes\n5.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is abundant, allowing for a more aggressive hunting strategy while still maintaining a balance. A moderate increase to 0.4 reflects a cautious approach to capitalize on the current sheep availability without risking overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently abundant, allowing for a more aggressive hunting strategy without immediately threatening their numbers. A moderate increase to 0.55 strikes a balance between hunting intensity and the need to maintain a sustainable ecosystem, while also considering the current wolf population growth.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the wolf population moderately high, maintaining a theta of 0.50 supports sustainable coexistence while still allowing for some hunting to ensure our pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, but the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A moderate approach allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some hunting to support our population. This gradual adjustment helps avoid sudden crashes and maintains balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition among wolves. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that we need to allow the sheep population to recover. A moderate theta value will help maintain a balance, ensuring the long-term survival of both species while avoiding overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition among wolves. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that we need to allow the sheep population to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species and avoid depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 45.7% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. However, the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition, so a moderate adjustment is necessary to maintain balance and ensure long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition among wolves. With the sheep population at 41.2% of its maximum capacity, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level relative to the wolf population, indicating that we need to focus on reducing competition among wolves while allowing the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance without over-depleting the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition among wolves. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain balance and ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low relative to the wolf population, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help sustain wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover gradually. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition among us. The sheep population is also relatively low compared to the maximum capacity, so I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while managing our numbers. A lower theta will help balance the ecosystem and prevent overhunting, ensuring long-term survival for both wolves and sheep."
