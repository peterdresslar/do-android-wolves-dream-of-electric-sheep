            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 45\n- Sheep population: 34.29\n- Wolf population: 41.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.350\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.84 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 31.2% of maximum capacity\n\nEcosystem observations:\n- The wolf population is quite high, which may lead to increased competition.\n- The ratio of sheep to wolves is becoming less favorable, which may require adaptation.\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3. Adjust your hunting intensity gradually in response to population changes\n4. Find a balance that creates sustainable cycles rather than crashes\n5.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently abundant at 99.47, which allows for a more aggressive hunting strategy without immediately threatening their recovery. This increase in theta will help ensure the wolf population can thrive while still considering the long-term balance of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently abundant at 95.58, which allows for a more aggressive hunting strategy without immediately threatening their recovery. Increasing theta to 0.70 will help ensure the wolf population can thrive while still keeping an eye on the balance needed for long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, but the wolf population is moderately high. To ensure long-term survival and maintain a healthy balance, I will adopt a moderate hunting intensity that allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves. This adjustment will help prevent over-depletion of the sheep population as the ratio of sheep to wolves is becoming less favorable.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, but the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A moderate hunting intensity will allow for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves. This approach helps balance the needs of both populations without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition among wolves. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain balance while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition among wolves. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that we need to allow the sheep population to recover. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can help ensure a sustainable balance between both populations while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support reproduction while still prioritizing the balance needed for both populations to thrive. This gradual adjustment helps avoid over-depletion of sheep and maintains a healthier ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that we need to allow the sheep population to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize our numbers while giving sheep a chance to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low relative to the wolf population, indicating increased competition among wolves. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach to hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment helps maintain sustainability without risking a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition among wolves. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that we need to allow the sheep population to recover. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low relative to the wolf population, and increasing competition among wolves is becoming a concern. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a modest hunting intensity that can help sustain the sheep population while still addressing the growing wolf numbers. This approach aims to maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, and a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while we manage our numbers more sustainably. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem."
