This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",

A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, enabling us to maintain our numbers while giving sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment helps avoid overhunting and supports long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition among wolves. The sheep population is at a sustainable level, but the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. By lowering my hunting intensity slightly, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",

This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",

This approach supports sustainable coexistence.",
