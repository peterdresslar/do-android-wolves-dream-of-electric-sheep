With the wolf population being relatively high, it is wise to slightly reduce hunting intensity to avoid over-depletion of sheep while still ensuring our pack can thrive. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance.",

A moderate hunting intensity allows for sustainable coexistence while giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",

The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that we need to allow the sheep population to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus more on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring a sustainable balance.",

By slightly increasing my hunting intensity, I can help ensure the wolf population remains healthy while allowing the sheep to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
