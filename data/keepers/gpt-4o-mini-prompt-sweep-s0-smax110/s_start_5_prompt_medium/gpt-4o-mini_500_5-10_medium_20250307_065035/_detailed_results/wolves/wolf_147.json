            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at its maximum capacity, and while it is important to maintain a healthy wolf population, I need to ensure that I do not deplete the sheep too quickly. A moderate hunting intensity will allow for some reproduction among wolves while giving the sheep a chance to recover and maintain their numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that we should not increase hunting intensity further. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, enabling the sheep to recover while still providing enough sustenance for our wolf pack. This strategy helps maintain our population without risking a crash in sheep numbers.",

To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain balance and prevent overhunting.",
