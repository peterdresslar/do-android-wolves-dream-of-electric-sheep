            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 90\n- Sheep population: 11.20\n- Wolf population: 37.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.400\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.30 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 10.2% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 83.9% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still maintaining a sustainable balance with the sheep population. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.92, a moderate increase in theta will help ensure that both populations can thrive without leading to depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 71.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 56.00, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure our long-term survival. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, focusing on competition among wolves while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment reflects the need to balance the growing wolf population while ensuring the sheep can recover and thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.70, a slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow sheep to recover while still enabling wolves to maintain their population. This moderate approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery. A gradual increase aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.26, which is only 24.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting without depleting the sheep further, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.30, which is only 19.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of the wolf pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.62, which is only 16.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.01, which is only 13.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while being mindful of the need to avoid overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.27, which is only 12.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own wolf population. A slight increase in theta from my previous value will help maintain a balance without over-depleting the sheep, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.02, which is only 10.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.20, which is only 10.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing our own population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack without depleting the sheep further, promoting a healthier ecosystem balance."
