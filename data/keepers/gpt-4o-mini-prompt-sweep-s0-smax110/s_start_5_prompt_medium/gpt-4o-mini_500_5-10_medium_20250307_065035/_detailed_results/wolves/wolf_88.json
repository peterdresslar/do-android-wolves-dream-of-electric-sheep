This adjustment reflects a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. It also considers the current wolf population, which is stable, allowing for a gradual increase in hunting.",

A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while still enabling the wolf population to thrive. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.72, which is only 20.7% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A moderate increase from my previous theta of 0.400 helps maintain a balance as the sheep population can recover.",
