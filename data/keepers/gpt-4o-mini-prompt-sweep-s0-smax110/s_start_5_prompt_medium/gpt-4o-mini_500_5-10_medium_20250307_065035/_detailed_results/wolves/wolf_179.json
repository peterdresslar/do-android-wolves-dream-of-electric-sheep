            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 229\n- Sheep population: 11.28\n- Wolf population: 34.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.400\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.33 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 10.3% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 94.7% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This value balances the need for wolf reproduction with the sustainability of the sheep population, ensuring both can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 93.94, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that can support wolf reproduction while preventing over-depletion of the sheep. This adjustment reflects a balanced approach, considering the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the sheep population at 74% of maximum capacity and a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.48, a moderate theta will help maintain both populations while allowing for gradual adjustments in response to future changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while it is beneficial to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction, I want to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A moderate approach allows for a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 47.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.77, I need to be cautious about overhunting to avoid depleting the sheep population too quickly. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, allowing both populations to thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 28.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.45, it is essential to maintain a balance that allows for the recovery of the sheep while also ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help sustain both populations without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.90, which is only 21.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.44, which is only 17.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still giving sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.66, which is only 15.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while being mindful of the need to avoid over-depleting the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.58, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for more hunting intensity while still being cautious, as the wolf population is relatively high at 49. I aim to maintain a balance that supports both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.10, which is only 11.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support our wolf population without risking a significant decline in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I need to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the wolf population is relatively high. A slight decrease in hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover while still enabling wolves to compete effectively. This moderate approach helps maintain balance and prevents over-exploitation of the sheep."
