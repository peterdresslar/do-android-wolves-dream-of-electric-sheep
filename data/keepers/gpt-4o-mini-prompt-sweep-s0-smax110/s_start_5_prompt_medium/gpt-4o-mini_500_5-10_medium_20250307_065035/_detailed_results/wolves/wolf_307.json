            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 369\n- Sheep population: 12.46\n- Wolf population: 42.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.350\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.30 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 11.3% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. A moderate hunting intensity will allow for some sheep depletion while still enabling their recovery. This approach supports the long-term survival of both species and avoids overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still healthy at 101.27, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a balance as the sheep are close to their maximum capacity, while also considering the growing wolf population. A gradual adjustment will support sustainable coexistence without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sustainable coexistence. The sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that while there are enough sheep to sustain some hunting, we must be cautious not to over-deplete their numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the sheep population at 70% of its maximum capacity, a moderate theta will help maintain the balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population remains sustainable. This adjustment allows for gradual hunting while keeping an eye on both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but I need to be cautious as the wolf population is also relatively high. A slight decrease in hunting intensity allows for the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to thrive. This balance helps avoid over-depletion of the sheep and supports long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 42.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 70, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while also ensuring that the sheep can recover if needed.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.91, which is only 25.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for the sheep to recover without overhunting. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity from 0.450 to 0.40, I can focus on maintaining a balance that allows both the sheep and wolf populations to stabilize and thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.11, which is only 20.1% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A moderate adjustment helps maintain balance and allows for recovery of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.08, which is only 16.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population and maintaining a balance with the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.79, which is only 14.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. Additionally, with a wolf population of 53, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low at 0.30, suggesting that focusing on competition among wolves rather than intense hunting will help maintain balance and ensure long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.91, which is only 12.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be slightly increased to support wolf reproduction, it is crucial to avoid overhunting to allow the sheep population to recover. A small increase to 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for sustenance with the long-term health of both populations.",
