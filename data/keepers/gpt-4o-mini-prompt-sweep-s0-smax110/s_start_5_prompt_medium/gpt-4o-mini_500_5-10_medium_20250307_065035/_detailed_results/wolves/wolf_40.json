            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 89\n- Sheep population: 12.02\n- Wolf population: 42.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.400\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.29 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 10.9% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that we should be cautious about hunting intensity to avoid depleting their numbers too quickly. A moderate approach allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some hunting to support our wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and the wolf population is stable. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover further while still enabling us to maintain our numbers. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments to ensure long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 83.9% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 48, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 78.74, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are enough sheep to support a moderate hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 56.00, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 58.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population being quite close to the sheep population, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that supports both reproduction and the recovery of sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with a wolf population of 69, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A theta of 0.40 strikes a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both populations while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.30, which is only 19.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate increase to 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population and maintaining a balance with the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.62, which is only 16.0% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, a slight increase in hunting intensity will help balance the needs of both species without depleting the sheep too quickly. This moderate adjustment allows for sustainable coexistence while still addressing the current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.01, which is only 13.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.4 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the long-term balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.27, which is only 12.1% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still being cautious. A theta of 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, enabling me to maintain a sustainable coexistence with the sheep while also considering the growing wolf population. This gradual adjustment helps avoid over-depletion of the sheep and supports the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.02, which is only 10.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance."
