            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. A moderate approach will help maintain balance and prevent over-depletion of the sheep, ensuring long-term survival for both wolves and sheep.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery. Maintaining a lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, as it prevents overhunting and allows the sheep population to stabilize.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and hunting them more aggressively could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. By maintaining a moderate approach, I can ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep while allowing the sheep population to recover. This balance will help sustain our ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that we should be cautious with our hunting to avoid depleting their numbers too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that supports wolf reproduction while still giving sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high at 101.92, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",

However, with the wolf population at 56, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both populations can thrive. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, it is wise to maintain a moderate approach to avoid over-depleting the sheep while still allowing for some hunting to support wolf reproduction. A theta of 0.40 allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between both populations.",

While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.40 strikes a balance between hunting and competing with other wolves, promoting sustainability in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.30, which is only 19.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population, ensuring a sustainable balance.",

This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover.
