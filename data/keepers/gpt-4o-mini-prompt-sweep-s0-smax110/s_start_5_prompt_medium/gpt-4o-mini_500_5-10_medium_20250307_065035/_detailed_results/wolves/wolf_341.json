This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A moderate increase from my previous theta of 0.38 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still recognizing the need to adjust to the current population dynamics.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.91, which is only 25.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is potential for recovery in the sheep population. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.35, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of sustainable coexistence.",

This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to help sustain our wolf population while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep too quickly. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain balance and avoid sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.08, which is only 16.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to allow for recovery. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the sheep",
