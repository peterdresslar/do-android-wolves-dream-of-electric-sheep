            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 293\n- Sheep population: 28.75\n- Wolf population: 68.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.450\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.42 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 26.1% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a high availability of prey. However, to ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover while also managing competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. A moderate approach will help maintain balance and prevent over-depletion of sheep, ensuring long-term survival for both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery and prevent depletion. Maintaining a lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, as it allows for a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to recover, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",

Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition with other wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover. This balance is crucial for the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and a higher hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers, jeopardizing long-term sustainability. Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover while keeping competition with other wolves in check.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers, jeopardizing the long-term survival of both species. Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover and ensures that the wolf population remains stable without overexploiting the prey.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery. Maintaining a balance is crucial to ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, especially as the wolf population is relatively stable. Gradual adjustments will help avoid depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that they are vulnerable to overhunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting while still prioritizing the competition with other wolves. This balance helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 7.33, it is crucial to focus on competition with other wolves to prevent overhunting and ensure the long-term survival of both species. A lower theta will help maintain balance in the ecosystem.",

A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance while avoiding over-depletion of the sheep, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery. Maintaining a balance is crucial to avoid depleting the sheep, which would jeopardize the long-term survival of both species. Given the current wolf population, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta reflects a cautious approach to capitalize on the current sheep abundance while avoiding overexploitation. This balance will help sustain both populations in the long run.",

A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring a balanced approach that supports both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term survival of both species. This moderate adjustment helps maintain a balance as the wolf population is relatively stable, and it allows for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently healthy at 102.33, which is close to their maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious to avoid depleting the sheep population. A moderate increase to 0.4 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for sustainable coexistence.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 56.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population slightly higher than the sheep population, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the wolf population is relatively high. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to thrive. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
