            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 369\n- Sheep population: 12.46\n- Wolf population: 42.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.350\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.30 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 11.3% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to compete effectively. This approach supports long-term sustainability and prevents overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and a moderate increase in hunting intensity will allow for sustainable coexistence while still enabling the wolf population to thrive. This gradual adjustment helps prevent over-depletion of sheep while also considering the current wolf population dynamics.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still healthy at 101.27, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 42.00, it's important to avoid overhunting to maintain balance. A moderate increase to 0.45 allows for sustainable coexistence while still promoting wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 90.42, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A moderate approach will allow for sustainable coexistence as we adapt to the current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 70% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population also being relatively high, a moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep too quickly. This gradual adjustment allows for both populations to thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep. This adjustment will help maintain our wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without depleting their numbers too quickly. This adjustment reflects a balance between ensuring the wolf population remains healthy while allowing the sheep to recover and thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term health of both species. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to ensure that the sheep can recover while we maintain a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.91, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking over-depletion. This moderate adjustment will help sustain both the wolf and sheep populations while allowing for gradual recovery of the sheep. It reflects a balanced approach to ensure long-term survival and coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.11, which is only 20.1% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.08, which is only 16.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting while still prioritizing the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.79, which is only 14.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to be cautious with our hunting to allow the sheep to recover. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.30, there is still a need to maintain a balance that supports our wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a bit more hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.91, which is only 12.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is a need to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support the wolf population. A theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting while prioritizing the long-term balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.46, which is only 11.3% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I also want to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a bit more hunting intensity while still prioritizing sustainability and avoiding over-depletion of the sheep."
