            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring both populations can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the sheep-to-wolf ratio being slightly above 1, it is prudent to maintain a moderate hunting intensity to ensure both populations can thrive. This adjustment allows for gradual increases in hunting as the sheep population grows while also considering the current wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the sheep-to-wolf ratio being below 1, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 36.6% of its maximum capacity, which indicates that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. Given the current wolf population of 69, a moderate approach allows for some hunting while also considering the need to compete with other wolves. This adjustment helps maintain a balance between the two populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 28.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69.00, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves to maintain balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.90, which is only 21.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should maintain a cautious approach to hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.450 to 0.40 reflects a balanced strategy, focusing on sustainable coexistence while still allowing for some hunting to support our wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.44, which is only 17.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is a need to allow the sheep to recover while also considering the growing wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep further, promoting a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.66, which is only 15.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.58, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring a balance that promotes the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.10, which is only 11.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help balance the need for hunting with the importance of not depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.98, which is only 10.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 strikes a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep can rebound, promoting long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.78, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help balance the ecosystem without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.65, which is only 9.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some replenishment of the sheep population while also ensuring that the wolf population remains stable. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.58, which is only 9.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both populations. It also reflects the need to be cautious as the wolf population is relatively high at 23.00, suggesting that competition among wolves could be a concern if hunting is too aggressive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.70, which is only 9.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity to 0.40, I can still maintain some pressure on the sheep while allowing for a gradual recovery. This approach balances the need for wolf reproduction with the sustainability of the sheep population."
