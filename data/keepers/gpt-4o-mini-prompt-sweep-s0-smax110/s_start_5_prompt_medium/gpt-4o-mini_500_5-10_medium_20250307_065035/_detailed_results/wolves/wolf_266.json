However, with the wolf population being slightly higher than the sheep population, a moderate theta allows for a balanced approach that supports both populations without risking depletion or overcompetition.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 43.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 36.95, which is only 33.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By lowering my hunting intensity slightly, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still keeping an eye on the sheep population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.75, which is only 26.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.64, which is only 21.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I can increase my hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. A moderate increase to 0.45 allows for a balanced approach that supports both wolf growth and sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.38, which is only 17.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is potential for recovery if I reduce hunting intensity slightly. By lowering theta to 0.40, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.79, which is only 15.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from the previous theta of 0.400 to 0.350, I can still maintain some hunting activity while prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both populations. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.68, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.39, which is only 12.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our wolf population without depleting the sheep further, ensuring a more balanced ecosystem.",

This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while maintaining a stable wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting without depleting the sheep further, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.19, which is only 10.2% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to help sustain wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.35 aligns with the wisdom of making small adjustments in response to changing conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.98, which is only 10.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, ensuring both our survival and the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.90, which is only 9.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are struggling, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to recover. Additionally, with a wolf population of 23.00, focusing on competition among wolves rather than intense hunting will help maintain our numbers while giving the sheep a chance to rebound.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.07, which is only 10.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be slightly increased to support wolf reproduction, it is crucial to avoid overhunting to allow the sheep population to recover. A moderate increase to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while being mindful of the delicate ecosystem.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.56, which is only 10.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low at 11.98, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking over-depletion. This adjustment supports my pack",
