With the sheep population at 61.0% of maximum capacity and a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.08, I can afford to maintain a moderate hunting intensity. This will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep while allowing for gradual adjustments as conditions change.",

This suggests that while there is some opportunity for hunting, it is crucial to maintain a balance to allow the sheep to recover.
