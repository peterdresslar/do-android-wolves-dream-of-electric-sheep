            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but I need to be cautious as the wolf population is relatively high. A moderate theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still giving sheep a chance to recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.26, which is only 24.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased slightly to support wolf reproduction, it is essential to remain cautious and avoid overhunting. A moderate increase to 0.45 allows for some hunting while still considering the long-term sustainability of both populations."
