This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to ensure that the sheep can recover and that the wolf population remains stable.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still ensuring that the sheep population can recover and thrive. A gradual increase is essential to maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover gradually.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level relative to its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help balance the ecosystem without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.75, which is only 26.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to allow for recovery. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term balance and sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.64, which is only 21.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",

This suggests that while there is some opportunity for hunting, it is crucial to maintain a balance to allow the sheep to recover.

This adjustment aims to support both the wolf population and the recovery of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the wolf population is relatively high. A slight decrease in hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover while still enabling wolves to compete effectively.

This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still being cautious. A theta of 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for some hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly.

This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own wolf population. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance and prevent over-depletion of the sheep, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
