            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 86.3% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This value balances the need to sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover. It reflects a cautious approach, responding to the current conditions without risking a drastic depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because it represents a balanced approach to hunting that allows for sustainable coexistence. The sheep population is currently at a healthy level, and while I want to ensure the wolf population remains strong, I also recognize the importance of not overhunting. This slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a gradual adjustment in response to the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the overall ecosystem health.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing coexistence. This adjustment reflects the need to balance our wolf population growth with the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 69, which is relatively high, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves while allowing the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the balance needed for both populations to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 33.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 70, it is important to avoid overhunting to ensure our long-term survival. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach to hunting while still considering the need for competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.57, which is only 26.0% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 will enable me to hunt more effectively without depleting the sheep too quickly, maintaining a balance that supports both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.72, which is only 20.7% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and support the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.24, which is only 16.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 reflects a slight increase in hunting compared to my previous value, acknowledging the need to balance competition with other wolves while still prioritizing the sustainability of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.68, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low at 0.29. This suggests that while hunting intensity should be increased to support wolf reproduction, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep population further. A slight increase to 0.40 allows for more hunting while still considering the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.62, which is only 12.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta value of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both populations. It also accounts for the growing wolf population, which suggests a need to balance competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.23, which is only 11.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some reproduction among wolves while still giving sheep a chance to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting sustainability without risking a rapid decline in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.26, which is only 10.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support reproduction, but not so much that it further depletes the sheep. This balanced approach will help maintain sustainability in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.74, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting. This lower theta will help balance the populations and promote long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.43, which is only 9.5% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will enable me to hunt a bit more while still focusing on competition with other wolves, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.24, which is only 9.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is an opportunity to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A small increase to 0.40 maintains a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring sustainability."
