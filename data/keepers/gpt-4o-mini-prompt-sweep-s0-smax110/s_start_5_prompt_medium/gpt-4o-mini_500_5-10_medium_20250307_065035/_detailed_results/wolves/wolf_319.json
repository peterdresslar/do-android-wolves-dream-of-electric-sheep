            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 90.42, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term survival of both species. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for wolf reproduction with the necessity of allowing the sheep population to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 70% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.33, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual increase is necessary to avoid over-depletion of the sheep and to ensure a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population also being relatively high, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 32.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 70, I need to be cautious about overhunting. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.91, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help support the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A moderate increase to 0.45 reflects a balanced approach, responding to the current conditions and trends.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.11, which is only 20.1% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, allowing both populations to stabilize without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.08, which is only 16.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support our wolf population without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.79, which is only 14.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a need for caution in hunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.46, which is only 11.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 strikes a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep can rebound, promoting long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.55, which is only 10.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting without risking depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach to hunting while still considering the need to compete with other wolves. This adjustment aims to support the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.93, which is only 9.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting a theta of 0.35, I can focus more on competing with other wolves to stabilize our population while allowing the sheep to gradually increase. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.55, which is only 9.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves."
