            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. A lower theta will help balance competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to stabilize and grow, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. A lower theta allows for competition among wolves, which can help keep our numbers in check while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual approach helps maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is necessary to maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 94.91, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without overly depleting the sheep population, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently healthy, and while I want to ensure my pack thrives, I also need to allow for the sheep to recover and maintain a sustainable balance. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help prevent over-depletion of the sheep while still allowing for some hunting to support my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover gradually.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, which is relatively high, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight decrease in theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring that both populations can thrive without leading to depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 33.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for more hunting to support wolf reproduction while still being mindful of the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.57, which is only 26.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.40 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population and maintaining a balance with the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.72, which is only 20.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased slightly to support wolf reproduction, it is crucial to avoid overhunting to allow the sheep population to recover. A moderate increase to 0.45 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for sustenance with the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.24, which is only 16.6% of its maximum capacity. While I want to ensure the survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to be cautious about increasing hunting intensity too quickly. A slight reduction in hunting will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.68, which is only 14.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus more on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.62, which is only 12.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain our wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach that supports both our needs and the ecosystem",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.23, which is only 11.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance."
