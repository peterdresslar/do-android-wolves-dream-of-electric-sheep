            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 444\n- Sheep population: 9.71\n- Wolf population: 28.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.400\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.35 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 8.8% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 93.14, allowing for some hunting without risking depletion. However, I want to be cautious as the wolf population is also significant at 50.00. A slight reduction from my previous theta of 0.76 will help maintain balance while still allowing for reproduction and ensuring the wolves thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain our wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the sheep population at 52.9% of its maximum capacity, I can maintain a sustainable coexistence while still ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. This adjustment allows for gradual hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly, aligning with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 39.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 73, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to prevent a crash in the sheep population. A slight decrease in hunting intensity allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still supporting wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level relative to the maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A slight decrease in hunting will help sustain both populations while still allowing for some hunting to support the wolf pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.18, which is only 22.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for sheep recovery while also considering the growing wolf population. A slight decrease from my previous theta will help maintain balance and prevent over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.27, which is only 17.5% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will enable me to hunt more effectively while still prioritizing the long-term balance of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.11, which is only 14.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support our wolf population without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.78, which is only 12.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting without depleting the sheep further. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.35 to 0.40, I can maintain a balance that allows for some hunting while still considering the long-term survival of both species. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of adapting to changing conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.29, which is only 11.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is potential for recovery if I reduce my hunting intensity slightly. A theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to support reproduction. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.13, which is only 10.1% of its maximum capacity. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover while also addressing the growing wolf population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and focuses on long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.47, which is only 9.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a slight hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A small increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without risking the depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.99, which is only 9.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.71, which is only 8.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for some hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of both populations. It also considers the current wolf population, which is relatively high, and avoids drastic changes that could destabilize the ecosystem."
