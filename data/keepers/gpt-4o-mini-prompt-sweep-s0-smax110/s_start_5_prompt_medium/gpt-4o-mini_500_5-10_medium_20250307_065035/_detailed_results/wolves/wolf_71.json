This will help sustain our wolf population while still ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is necessary to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly, maintaining a balance that supports both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with a wolf population of 69, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A moderate decrease from my previous theta allows for continued reproduction while ensuring that the sheep population can recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 33.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 70, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to prevent a crash. A moderate increase in theta allows for some hunting while still considering the long-term balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.26, which is only 24.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while we can increase our hunting intensity, we should do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.55 allows for some hunting to support our wolf population while still giving the sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.30, which is only 19.4% of its maximum capacity. While I want to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I need to be cautious about overhunting the sheep. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.62, which is only 16.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to allow for recovery. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring a balance that promotes long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.01, which is only 13.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still being mindful of the need to avoid overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.27, which is only 12.1% of its maximum capacity.

To allow the sheep to recover and maintain a sustainable balance, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting. This lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.51, which is only 9.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting to support the wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a cautious approach to hunting without risking a rapid decline in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.40, which is only 9.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.42, which is only 9.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should prioritize allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach that balances our need for sustenance with the long-term health of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.62, which is only 9.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.86, which is only 9.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 reflects a balanced approach, prioritizing competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.18, which is only 10.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting without risking depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still being mindful of the sheep population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.60, which is only 10.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to allow the sheep to recover before increasing hunting intensity. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.12, which is only 11.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.66, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.33, which is only 12.1% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.10, which is only 12.8% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. A moderate adjustment helps maintain balance and allows for sustainable coexistence."
