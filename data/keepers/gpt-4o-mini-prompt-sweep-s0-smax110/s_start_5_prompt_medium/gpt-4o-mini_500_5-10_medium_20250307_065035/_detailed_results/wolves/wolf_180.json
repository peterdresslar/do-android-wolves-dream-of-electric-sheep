            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 94.7% of maximum capacity, allowing for some increased hunting intensity without risking depletion. However, I want to avoid a drastic increase in hunting to ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep. A gradual approach will help maintain balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 85.4% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while still ensuring that the sheep can recover. A gradual adjustment is key to maintaining balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring both populations can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the sheep population at 61.0% of maximum capacity and a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.08, I can maintain a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep population has room to recover. This gradual adjustment helps avoid overexploitation and promotes long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 47.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 68, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 36.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 30.82, which is only 28.0% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, allowing for sustainable coexistence while avoiding over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.90, which is only 21.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing our own population. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance and prevent overexploitation of the sheep, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.44, which is only 17.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.66, which is only 15.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to allow the sheep to recover while also considering the growing wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance, allowing for some hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.58, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.10, which is only 11.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is an opportunity to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction while still allowing for sheep recovery. A moderate increase to 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, ensuring that we do not deplete the sheep population too quickly while still addressing the needs of our growing wolf pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.28, which is only 10.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the immediate needs of the wolf population."
