            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 361\n- Sheep population: 61.08\n- Wolf population: 65.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.713\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.94 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 55.5% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a sustainable balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly, as the sheep population is recovering but not at maximum capacity.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is key to avoiding drastic impacts on either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level relative to its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a potential strain on the sheep. A moderate hunting intensity will allow for some reproduction among wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover. This balance is crucial for the long-term survival of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.91, which is only 25.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight decrease in theta allows for a balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to support wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.11, which is only 20.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some reproduction among wolves while still giving sheep a chance to recover. A moderate increase from my previous theta of 0.40 allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking a rapid depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.08, which is only 16.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to ensure our own survival. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for sustenance with the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.79, which is only 14.4% of its maximum capacity. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species and avoids depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.91, which is only 12.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A moderate increase in theta to 0.40 strikes a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.46, which is only 11.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to recover. Additionally, with the wolf population at 42.00, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.55, which is only 10.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is an opportunity to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A gradual increase to 0.40 strikes a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.93, which is only 9.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for wolf survival while ensuring the sheep population can stabilize and grow.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.55, which is only 9.6% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable balance, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting. This will help stabilize both populations over time.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.43, which is only 9.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should be cautious with our hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the sustainability of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.44, which is only 9.5% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will enable me to hunt a bit more effectively while still prioritizing the balance needed for long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.54, which is only 9.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing our own population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our needs without depleting the sheep further, promoting a healthier balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.76, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that considers the need for both immediate sustenance and long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.09, which is only 10.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for sustenance with the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.50, which is only 10.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",

This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.57, which is only 11.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while still allowing for some hunting to maintain the wolf population."
