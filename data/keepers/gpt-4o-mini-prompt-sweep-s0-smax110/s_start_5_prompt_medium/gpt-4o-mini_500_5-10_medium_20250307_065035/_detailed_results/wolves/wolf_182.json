            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 230\n- Sheep population: 10.78\n- Wolf population: 30.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.400\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.36 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 9.8% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still healthy at 93.94, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf reproduction and sheep sustainability, while also considering the current wolf population of 47. A theta of 0.5 reflects a cautious approach that supports both species in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 81.45, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep do not deplete too quickly. A gradual adjustment is necessary to maintain balance and avoid overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, but the wolf population is also significant. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover further while still enabling the wolves to maintain their numbers. This approach aligns with the wisdom of making gradual adjustments to ensure long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery. A gradual increase aligns with the wisdom of maintaining balance and responding to population trends.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the wolf population is relatively high. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to thrive. This moderate approach helps maintain balance in the ecosystem without risking over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 28.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69.00, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.90, which is only 21.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I can increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.44, which is only 17.7% of its maximum capacity. While I want to ensure the wolves can reproduce, I also need to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 to 0.35 reflects a balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population dynamics.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.66, which is only 15.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.58, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A moderate adjustment helps maintain balance and allows for recovery of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.10, which is only 11.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for some hunting without risking a rapid depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.98, which is only 10.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population. This aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and sustainable coexistence.",
