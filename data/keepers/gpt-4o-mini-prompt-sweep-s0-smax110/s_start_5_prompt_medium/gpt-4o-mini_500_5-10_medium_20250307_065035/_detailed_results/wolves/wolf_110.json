            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 94.9% of maximum capacity, allowing for some increased hunting intensity without risking depletion. However, I want to avoid drastic changes, so a slight reduction from my previous theta will help maintain balance as the wolf population grows.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 94.91, allowing for some increased hunting intensity without risking depletion. However, with the wolf population at 47.00, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently healthy at 80.73, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while maintaining a sustainable balance with the sheep population. A gradual approach ensures that we do not disrupt the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still ensuring the sheep can recover over time.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population being relatively high at 69, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to allow both populations to stabilize. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 33.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 70, which is relatively high, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight decrease in theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.57, which is only 26.0% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help balance the ecosystem without risking immediate wolf population decline.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I need to maintain a balance, a slight increase in hunting intensity will help support the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. This adjustment allows for sustainable coexistence while still being mindful of the current trends.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.24, which is only 16.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate increase to 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population and maintaining a balance with the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low at 15.68, which is only 14.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while I need to be cautious about overhunting, a slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted to ensure my pack can thrive. A theta of 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still giving sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.62, which is only 12.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased to support wolf reproduction, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase to 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.23, which is only 11.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.26, which is only 10.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and ensures the long-term survival of both species."
