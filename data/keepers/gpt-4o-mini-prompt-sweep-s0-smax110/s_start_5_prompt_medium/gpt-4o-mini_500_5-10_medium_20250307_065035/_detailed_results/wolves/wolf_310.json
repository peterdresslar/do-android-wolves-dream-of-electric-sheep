            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 370\n- Sheep population: 11.55\n- Wolf population: 37.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.350\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.31 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 10.5% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and a moderate increase in hunting intensity will allow for some reproduction among wolves while still enabling the sheep to recover. This balance helps prevent over-depletion of the sheep population and supports the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still healthy at 101.27, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain our wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover if needed. A gradual adjustment is key to maintaining balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 90.42, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This balance helps maintain a sustainable ecosystem without risking a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 70% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. A moderate increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while ensuring that the sheep population does not deplete too quickly. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the sheep-to-wolf ratio being close to 1, it is essential to maintain a sustainable coexistence. A slight reduction from my previous theta will help ensure that both populations can thrive without depleting resources too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 42.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with a wolf population of 70, it is important to avoid overhunting to prevent a crash in the sheep population. A slight decrease in hunting intensity allows for a balanced approach that supports both the sheep and the wolf population over time.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level relative to its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both sheep and wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.91, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being mindful of the need for sheep recovery. This moderate adjustment helps maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can sustain itself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.11, which is only 20.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is potential for recovery if I reduce hunting intensity slightly. By moving to a moderate theta of 0.40, I can focus on balancing competition with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.08, which is only 16.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate increase to 0.35 allows for some hunting while still focusing on the competition with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.79, which is only 14.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for more hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance that supports both wolf and sheep populations. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of adapting to changing conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.91, which is only 12.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.46, which is only 11.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our needs while prioritizing the balance of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.55, which is only 10.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach while still considering the need to compete with other wolves."
