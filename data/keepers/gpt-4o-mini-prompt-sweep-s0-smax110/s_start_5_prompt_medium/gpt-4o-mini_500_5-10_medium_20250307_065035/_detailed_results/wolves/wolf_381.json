            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 442\n- Sheep population: 10.47\n- Wolf population: 36.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.350\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.29 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 9.5% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high at 93.8% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover if needed.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 93.14, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance of the ecosystem. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a sustainable coexistence as the wolf population is stable, and it allows for gradual adaptation to the current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balanced approach. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while it is beneficial to hunt, I need to be cautious as the wolf population is relatively high. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still supporting the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 39.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.13, which is only 29.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I need to be cautious about overhunting, I can still afford to maintain a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while also giving the sheep a chance to recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.18, which is only 22.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room to increase hunting intensity slightly without risking immediate depletion of the sheep. A theta of 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still being mindful of the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.27, which is only 17.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support our wolf population without depleting the sheep further, promoting a more sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.11, which is only 14.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some replenishment of the sheep while also ensuring that the wolf population remains healthy. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach that supports both populations without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.78, which is only 12.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, reducing pressure on the sheep while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.29, which is only 11.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.13, which is only 10.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable, and I need to focus on allowing their numbers to recover while still competing with other wolves. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.47, which is only 9.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.30 maintains a focus on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring a balanced approach that supports long-term sustainability."
