            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at maximum capacity, and a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This approach helps maintain a balance in the ecosystem and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover and ensures the long-term survival of both species. It is crucial to focus on competition with other wolves at this stage to stabilize the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. A slight increase in hunting intensity will allow for some reproduction while still giving sheep a chance to recover. This approach maintains a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 93.8% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population while still considering the need for balance. A gradual increase to 0.4 reflects a cautious approach to ensure both populations can thrive without leading to depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 93.14, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment reflects a balance between ensuring wolf reproduction and allowing the sheep to recover, while also considering the current wolf population and the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual increase in theta aligns with the current trends and ensures a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 52.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both populations can thrive. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 39.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 73, I need to be cautious about over-hunting. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain their numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and while I need to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.18, which is only 22.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.450 to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, focusing on sustainable coexistence while still considering the need for wolf population health.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.27, which is only 17.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still being mindful of the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.11, which is only 14.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable, and I should focus on allowing their numbers to recover while still competing with other wolves. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the long-term balance of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.78, which is only 12.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to increase, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.29, which is only 11.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some recovery of the sheep while still ensuring the wolf population remains stable. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without risking a rapid decline in sheep numbers."
