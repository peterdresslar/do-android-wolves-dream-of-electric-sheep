            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 159\n- Sheep population: 11.26\n- Wolf population: 38.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.400\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.30 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 10.2% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that they are healthy and can sustain a moderate level of hunting. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity from the previous theta, I can ensure that the sheep population continues to thrive while also allowing for the growth of the wolf population. This balanced approach supports long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 94.91, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a sustainable level of prey. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring that both sheep and wolf populations can thrive without risking depletion or overcompetition.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 80.73, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This approach balances the needs of both populations and avoids depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 58.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population nearly equal to the sheep population, a slight reduction in hunting intensity is prudent to allow for the recovery of both populations. This moderate approach will help maintain balance without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 69, which is relatively high, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the competition among wolves, ensuring that both populations can stabilize and thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 37.27, which is only 33.9% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still being cautious. A theta of 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for sustainable coexistence while also considering the need to maintain a healthy wolf population. It is a small adjustment from my previous theta, aligning with the wisdom of making gradual changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.57, which is only 26.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done gradually to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that supports both wolf reproduction and sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.72, which is only 20.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for the sheep to recover. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity from 0.450 to 0.40, I can focus more on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring a sustainable balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.24, which is only 16.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain its health. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting without risking a rapid depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I need to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.62, which is only 12.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.23, which is only 11.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates a need for a cautious approach to hunting. By slightly increasing theta from 0.35 to 0.40, I can maintain a balance that allows for some hunting while still giving the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of avoiding sudden changes and adapting to the current state of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.26, which is only 10.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support our wolf population without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance."
