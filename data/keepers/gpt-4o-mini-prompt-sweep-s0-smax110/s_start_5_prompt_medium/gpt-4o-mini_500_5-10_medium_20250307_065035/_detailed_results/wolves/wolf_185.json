            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 85.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with a wolf population of 47, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is 2.00, suggesting that while hunting can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still enabling the sheep population to recover and maintain balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover and thrive. A gradual increase is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.77, it indicates that we need to be cautious about hunting intensity. A slight reduction from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting to support our population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment reflects a balanced approach, considering both the current sheep population and the growing wolf numbers. It allows for continued reproduction while maintaining the health of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 30.82, which is only 28.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight decrease in hunting intensity allows for a more sustainable coexistence and gives the sheep a chance to recover while still enabling the wolf population to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.90, which is only 21.7% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still competing with other wolves. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting without depleting the sheep population further, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.44, which is only 17.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.66, which is only 15.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should prioritize the recovery of the sheep population while still allowing for some hunting to sustain our wolf pack. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, ensuring that we do not over-deplete the sheep while still competing effectively with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.58, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.35 helps maintain a balance while being mindful of the current low sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.10, which is only 11.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack without depleting the sheep further, promoting a balance that can lead to long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.98, which is only 10.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach to hunting while still considering the need for sustainable coexistence. It reflects a cautious optimism about the sheep population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.28, which is only 10.3% of its maximum capacity.
