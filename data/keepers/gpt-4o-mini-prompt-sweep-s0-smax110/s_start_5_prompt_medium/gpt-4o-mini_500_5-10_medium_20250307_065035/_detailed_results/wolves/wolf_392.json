            "I chose this theta because it represents a balanced approach to hunting. The sheep population is currently at 70.9% of its maximum capacity, which allows for some increased hunting without risking depletion. At the same time, the wolf population is relatively stable, so I need to ensure we don",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the sheep population at 52.9% of its maximum capacity, I can afford to maintain a slightly lower hunting intensity to ensure that both sheep and wolves can thrive. This gradual adjustment helps prevent over-depletion of sheep while still allowing for some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 39.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 73, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 29.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 73, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to prevent a crash in the sheep population. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach to hunting while still considering the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.18, which is only 22.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 strikes a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can rebound, promoting long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.27, which is only 17.5% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking the depletion of the sheep population. A moderate increase to 0.40 will help sustain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.11, which is only 14.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting without risking a crash in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.78, which is only 12.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting without risking the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.29, which is only 11.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate increase to 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.13, which is only 10.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.47, which is only 9.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are struggling, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to increase. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.99, which is only 9.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain our wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help balance the need for hunting with the necessity of not depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.71, which is only 8.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also considering the growing wolf population. A moderate theta value will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.54, which is only 8.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting sustainability while still being mindful of the wolf population growth."
