            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the sheep-to-wolf ratio being close to 1, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, which is relatively high, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that supports both sheep recovery and wolf population stability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 33.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. Given the current wolf population of 70, a slight reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain balance while allowing the sheep to recover and ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.57, which is only 26.0% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.72, which is only 20.7% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I also want to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will enable me to hunt more effectively while still prioritizing the long-term balance between both populations."
