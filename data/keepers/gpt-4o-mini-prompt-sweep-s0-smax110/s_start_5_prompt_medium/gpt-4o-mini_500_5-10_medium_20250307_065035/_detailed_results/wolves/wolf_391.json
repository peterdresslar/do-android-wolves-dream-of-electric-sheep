            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight reduction in hunting intensity to maintain balance. This will help ensure the sheep can recover while still allowing for sustainable wolf reproduction. A moderate approach will support both populations in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while I want to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I also need to allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain balance without risking depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the wolf population is relatively high. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain their numbers. This approach supports long-term coexistence and avoids depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.13, which is only 29.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.18, which is only 22.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is some opportunity for hunting, it is essential to maintain a balance to allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease from my previous theta of 0.450 will help ensure that we do not over-deplete the sheep population while still allowing for some hunting to support our wolf pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.27, which is only 17.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate increase to 0.35 allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.11, which is only 14.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.78, which is only 12.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to ensure our own survival. A theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, reducing competition with other wolves while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.29, which is only 11.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting sustainability while still considering the need to compete with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.13, which is only 10.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need to compete with other wolves and ensuring the sheep have a chance to increase their numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.47, which is only 9.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a slight increase in hunting intensity is appropriate to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A gradual increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.99, which is only 9.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting without risking the depletion of the sheep, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be increased slightly to support wolf reproduction while still allowing for some recovery of the sheep population. This moderate increase helps maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.54, which is only 8.7% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help balance the ecosystem and prevent over-depletion of the sheep."
