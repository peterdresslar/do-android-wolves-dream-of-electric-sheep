            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover. A gradual adjustment is necessary to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly, and this theta reflects a balanced approach.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help ensure the wolf population can thrive while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual increase is necessary to maintain balance and avoid over-depleting the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover gradually.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while I want to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I also recognize the need to allow the sheep to recover slightly. A moderate approach will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a sustainable balance. This adjustment will help support the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep. This moderate adjustment will help maintain the health of both populations without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and while it is important to increase hunting to support wolf reproduction, I must do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that considers both the current sheep population and the need to sustain the wolf pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.90, which is only 21.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity and promote a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.44, which is only 17.7% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I also want to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between hunting and allowing the sheep population to grow, avoiding overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.66, which is only 15.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population and maintaining a balance with the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.58, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still being cautious. A moderate increase to 0.40 will help maintain a balance between hunting and allowing the sheep population to recover, ensuring the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.10, which is only 11.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.98, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help support the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual increase aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low at 11.28, which is only 10.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach, ensuring we do not deplete the sheep further while still competing effectively with other wolves."
