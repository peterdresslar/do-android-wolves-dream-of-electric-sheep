            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This balance will help sustain both the wolf and sheep populations while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain harmony in the ecosystem.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at its maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. By slightly reducing my hunting focus, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both sheep and wolves while still competing effectively with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain balance and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers, jeopardizing the long-term survival of both species. Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover while we focus on competition among wolves, ensuring a balanced ecosystem.",

A slight increase from my previous theta will enable some hunting while still prioritizing the balance needed for long-term survival.",

This will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover if needed. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 91.40, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction. However, I must remain cautious and avoid overhunting, as the sheep are not at maximum capacity and the wolf population is already significant. A gradual increase will help maintain balance.",
