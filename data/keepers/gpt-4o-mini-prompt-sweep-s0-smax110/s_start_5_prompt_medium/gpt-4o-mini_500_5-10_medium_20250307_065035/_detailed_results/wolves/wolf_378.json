            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 441\n- Sheep population: 11.13\n- Wolf population: 41.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.400\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.27 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 10.1% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and while it is important to maintain a healthy wolf population, I need to allow the sheep to recover slightly. A moderate approach will help ensure sustainable coexistence while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 93.8% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 42, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 93.14, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 50.00, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 70.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain the wolf population while allowing for a gradual recovery of the sheep, ensuring a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while I want to increase hunting to support wolf reproduction, I must also consider the growing wolf population. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach that supports both species without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 39.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 73, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.13, which is only 29.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is some room for increased hunting, I need to be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 allows for more hunting to support wolf reproduction while still maintaining a balance to prevent a crash in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.18, which is only 22.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to be cautious with our hunting to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.45 to 0.40, I can maintain a balance that supports both the wolf population and the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.27, which is only 17.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own population of 65 wolves. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach that prioritizes the sustainability of both species without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.11, which is only 14.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without over-depleting the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.78, which is only 12.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.400 to 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring a balance that supports both populations in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.29, which is only 11.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need to adapt to the changing conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.13, which is only 10.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A slight decrease from my previous theta of 0.4 will help balance our needs with the sustainability of the ecosystem."
