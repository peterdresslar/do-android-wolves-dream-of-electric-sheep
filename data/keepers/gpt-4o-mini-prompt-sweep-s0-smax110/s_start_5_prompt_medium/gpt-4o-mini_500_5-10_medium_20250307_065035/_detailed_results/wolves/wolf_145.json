            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 37.27, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are not enough sheep to sustain aggressive hunting without risking depletion. A gradual increase in theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, which will help stabilize our population and give sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.57, which is only 26.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while we can increase our hunting intensity slightly, we must be cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, enabling us to compete with other wolves while still allowing the sheep to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.72, which is only 20.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.24, which is only 16.6% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting, but not at an intensity that would further deplete the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.68, which is only 14.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase to 0.40 allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.62, which is only 12.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our needs without depleting the sheep further, promoting a healthier balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.23, which is only 11.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a moderate increase in hunting intensity is appropriate to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A gradual increase to 0.40 allows for a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting coexistence while still addressing the immediate needs of the pack.",

This approach will help both populations stabilize over time.",

A small increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence and sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.20, which is only 9.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for sheep recovery. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.400 to 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring a sustainable balance.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.85, which is only 10.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while maintaining a stable wolf population.
