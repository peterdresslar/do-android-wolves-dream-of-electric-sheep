            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 93.8% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover if needed. A gradual adjustment is crucial to maintain balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 93.14, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that can support wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep population does not decline too rapidly. This approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence, as the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we can afford to maintain a balanced hunting strategy without jeopardizing the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly and to maintain a balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity. This will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term survival while also allowing for gradual adjustments as conditions change.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help support the wolf population's growth while still allowing the sheep to recover and maintain their numbers. A gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of my ancestors, ensuring a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. While the sheep population is low, it is still recovering, and maintaining a moderate hunting intensity will help ensure both wolf and sheep populations can thrive together. This adjustment allows for gradual adaptation to the current conditions without risking a sudden decline in sheep numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.18, which is only 22.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep population further. A moderate increase to 0.45 allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.27, which is only 17.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.11, which is only 14.6% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still being cautious. By raising theta from 0.35 to 0.40, I can take advantage of the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.78, which is only 12.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.400 to 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.29, which is only 11.2% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking the depletion of the sheep population. A moderate increase to 0.40 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.13, which is only 10.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support our wolf population without risking a further decline in the sheep population, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.47, which is only 9.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a slight increase in hunting intensity is appropriate to help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, ensuring that we do not deplete the sheep too quickly while still addressing our immediate needs."
