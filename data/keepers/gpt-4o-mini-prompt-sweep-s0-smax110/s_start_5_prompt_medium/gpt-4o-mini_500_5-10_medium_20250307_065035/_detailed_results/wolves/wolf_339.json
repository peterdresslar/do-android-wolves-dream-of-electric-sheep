            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 385\n- Sheep population: 16.88\n- Wolf population: 6.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.450\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 2.81 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 15.3% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for increased hunting intensity without risking depletion. However, with the wolf population also being relatively high, a moderate increase in hunting will help maintain balance while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep. This approach aligns with the wisdom of making gradual adjustments to ensure long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain our wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 32.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 70, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both populations can thrive. A slight reduction from my previous theta allows for continued hunting while promoting balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.91, which is only 25.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is potential for recovery in the sheep population if I reduce my hunting intensity. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, enabling me to compete with other wolves while still allowing the sheep to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.11, which is only 20.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.450 to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, focusing on sustainable coexistence while still considering the need to compete with other wolves as our population is relatively high.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.08, which is only 16.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A moderate theta value of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack while not over-depleting the sheep, promoting a healthier ecosystem balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.79, which is only 14.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves and allow the sheep population to stabilize, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",

This suggests that while I can increase my hunting intensity slightly, I must be cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. A small increase to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still giving sheep a chance to recover.",
