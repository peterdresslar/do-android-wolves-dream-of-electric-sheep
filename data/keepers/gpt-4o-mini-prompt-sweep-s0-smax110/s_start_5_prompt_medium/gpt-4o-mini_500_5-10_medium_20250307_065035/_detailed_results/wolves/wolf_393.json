            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for some increased hunting intensity without risking depletion. However, I need to be cautious as the wolf population is also growing, so a moderate increase will help maintain balance while ensuring both populations can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for some increased hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sustainable coexistence as both populations fluctuate.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This will help support wolf reproduction while still maintaining a balance that prevents over-depletion of the sheep. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio, a moderate increase in hunting will help ensure both populations can thrive without leading to a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 29.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 73, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.18, which is only 22.0% of its maximum capacity. While I want to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I also need to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.45 strikes a balance between hunting and allowing the sheep population to stabilize, ensuring long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.27, which is only 17.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is a need to allow the sheep to recover while also considering the growing wolf population of 65. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, reducing hunting intensity slightly to promote sheep recovery while still enabling some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.11, which is only 14.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.78, which is only 12.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack without depleting the sheep further, promoting a more balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I need to ensure the survival of both wolves and sheep, a slight increase in hunting intensity will help sustain my pack without depleting the sheep too quickly. This adjustment allows for a gradual response to the current conditions while still considering the long-term health of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.13, which is only 10.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should prioritize the recovery of the sheep population while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our own health. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking a rapid depletion of sheep, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.47, which is only 9.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure and promote a more sustainable balance between wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.99, which is only 9.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.71, which is only 8.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep further.
