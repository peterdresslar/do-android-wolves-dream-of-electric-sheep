However, with the wolf population at 69, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A gradual increase in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still ensuring the wolves can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 36.95, which is only 33.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to allow for some recovery while still ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. A moderate increase from my previous theta of 0.25 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.75, which is only 26.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should maintain a cautious approach to hunting, allowing the sheep to recover while still ensuring that our wolf population remains healthy. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help balance our needs without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.64, which is only 21.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I can increase my hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. A moderate increase to 0.45 allows for a balanced approach that supports both wolves and sheep, promoting sustainability.",

This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on the competition among wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.79, which is only 15.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.4 to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, reducing hunting intensity while still considering the competition among wolves.",
