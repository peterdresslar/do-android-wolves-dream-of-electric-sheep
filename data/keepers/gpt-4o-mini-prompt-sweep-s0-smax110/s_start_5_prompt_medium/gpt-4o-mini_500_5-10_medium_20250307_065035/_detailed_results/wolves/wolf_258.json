            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring the sheep can recover. A gradual increase is necessary to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly, considering the current dynamics.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 43.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, I need to be cautious about overhunting, which could lead to a decline in sheep numbers and ultimately harm both populations. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, focusing on competition among wolves while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment reflects a balanced approach, considering the need to support wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep population can recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.75, which is only 26.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it is crucial to prioritize the recovery of the sheep population to ensure long-term sustainability. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, which will help balance the ecosystem.",
