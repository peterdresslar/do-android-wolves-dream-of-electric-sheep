            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. With a high sheep-to-wolf ratio, focusing on competition with other wolves will help maintain a sustainable balance without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves while allowing the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help balance the ecosystem without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This approach will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem without depleting the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help sustain both populations without risking a crash, as the wolf population is relatively stable.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still healthy at 92.7% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while ensuring that the sheep population can sustain itself. A gradual increase is wise to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 83.9% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 48, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 71.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still a healthy number of sheep available. However, with a wolf population of 56, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is relatively high at 1.41, suggesting that I should focus on maintaining a balance rather than intensifying hunting. A slight decrease in theta allows for some hunting while also enabling sheep to recover, promoting long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 33.0% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment reflects a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery. Gradually increasing theta helps maintain a sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.26, which is only 24.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is some opportunity for hunting, it is crucial to maintain a balance to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.40 allows for sustainable hunting while also considering the need to compete with other wolves as the population is relatively high.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.30, which is only 19.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain its health. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the balance between competing wolves and the sustainability of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.62, which is only 16.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.01, which is only 13.6% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must prioritize the recovery of the sheep. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, promoting a sustainable balance."
