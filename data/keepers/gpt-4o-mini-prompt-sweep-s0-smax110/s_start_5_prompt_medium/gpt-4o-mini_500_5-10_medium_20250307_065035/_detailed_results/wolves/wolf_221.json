            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in sheep numbers, jeopardizing the long-term survival of both species. Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover while keeping the wolf population stable.",

Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover while keeping the wolf population stable.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be cautiously increased to avoid depleting their numbers too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a more balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery.

With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 3.55, it is crucial to focus on competition among wolves to maintain a healthy balance and prevent overhunting, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help sustain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover and thrive.",

A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for sustainable coexistence.",
