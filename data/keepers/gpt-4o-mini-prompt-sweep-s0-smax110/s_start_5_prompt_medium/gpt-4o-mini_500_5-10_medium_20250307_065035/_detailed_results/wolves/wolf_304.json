            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking immediate depletion. This adjustment will help sustain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover over time.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help sustain our wolf population while still allowing sheep to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still healthy at 101.27, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This level will help sustain wolf reproduction while ensuring that the sheep population does not decline too rapidly. It reflects a balanced approach, considering both the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need for gradual adjustments.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 82.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep. However, the wolf population is also significant at 50, suggesting that a moderate hunting intensity is necessary to maintain balance. A theta of 0.55 allows for sustainable hunting while still enabling the sheep population to recover and thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 70% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 58, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, and while it is beneficial to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must also consider the growing wolf population. A theta of 0.40 allows for a balanced approach that supports both species without risking depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population also being relatively high, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level relative to the maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still providing enough resources for the wolves. This approach helps maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.91, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.11, which is only 20.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for sheep recovery while also considering the growing wolf population. A slight decrease from my previous theta of 0.45 will help maintain balance and prevent over-depletion of sheep, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.08, which is only 16.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to allow for recovery. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring a balanced approach that promotes sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.79, which is only 14.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I can increase my hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. A moderate increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach that supports both the wolf population and the recovery of sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.91, which is only 12.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sheep recovery. By lowering my hunting intensity slightly to 0.35, I can focus more on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.46, which is only 11.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased slightly to support wolf reproduction, it is crucial to avoid overhunting to allow the sheep population to recover. A gradual increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still allowing for some hunting."
