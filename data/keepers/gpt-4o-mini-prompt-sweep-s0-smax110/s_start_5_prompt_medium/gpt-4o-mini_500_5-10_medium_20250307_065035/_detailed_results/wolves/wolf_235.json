            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. A gradual increase from my previous theta will help balance competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competition with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to stabilize, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring our long-term survival while still allowing for some competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 93% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 41, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is key to maintaining balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a balanced approach. With the sheep-to-wolf ratio at 1.36, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a balance as the wolf population is slightly higher than the sheep population, ensuring both species can thrive together.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, but the wolf population is also significant. A slight decrease in hunting intensity allows for a more sustainable balance, enabling sheep to recover while still ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 36.95, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking over-depletion. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sustainable coexistence. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.400 aligns with the wisdom of making small adjustments in response to population trends.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.75, which is only 26.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. By adopting a lower theta, I can focus more on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring the long-term survival of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.64, which is only 21.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.38, which is only 17.6% of its maximum capacity. Given the high wolf population of 58, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.79, which is only 15.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach while still considering the need for gradual adjustments.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.68, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to allow for recovery. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both sheep and wolves."
