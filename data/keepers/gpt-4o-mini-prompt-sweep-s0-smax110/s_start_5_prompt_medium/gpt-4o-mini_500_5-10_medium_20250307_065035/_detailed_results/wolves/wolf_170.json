            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and while I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and prevent over-depletion of the sheep, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that they can sustain a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. A moderate increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the long-term health of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while maintaining a sustainable balance with the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a moderate hunting approach that supports both wolf reproduction and sheep recovery. This value reflects a cautious strategy, balancing the need to sustain our wolf population while ensuring the sheep can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still considering the long-term health of the sheep population. A gradual increase from my previous theta will help maintain balance without risking a sudden depletion of sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 61.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 62.00, it is wise to maintain a slightly lower hunting intensity to allow for sustainable coexistence and prevent over-depletion of the sheep. This gradual adjustment will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 47.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 68, which is relatively high, I need to be cautious about overhunting. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still providing enough sustenance for the wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing sheep to recover. A gradual increase is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 30.82, which is only 28.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A moderate increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.45 reflects a balanced approach, ensuring sustainable coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.90, which is only 21.7% of its maximum capacity. While I want to ensure the survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to be cautious about hunting intensity. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This moderate approach helps maintain a balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.44, which is only 17.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I need to maintain a focus on hunting to support wolf reproduction, I should do so cautiously to allow the sheep population to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the balance needed for long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.66, which is only 15.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.58, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for the sheep to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This gradual adjustment helps maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.10, which is only 11.9% of its maximum capacity. While I need to focus on hunting to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between both populations."
