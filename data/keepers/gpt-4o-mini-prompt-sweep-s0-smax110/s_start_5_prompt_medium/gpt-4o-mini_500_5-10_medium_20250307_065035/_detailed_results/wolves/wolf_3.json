            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the wolf population is relatively high. A moderate approach allows for some hunting while also considering the need to compete with other wolves. This balance helps ensure the sheep can recover while maintaining a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 5.27, which is only 4.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a presence in the hunting area. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our population without depleting the sheep further. It also prepares us for future increases in sheep numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderate to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 5.97, which is only 5.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some sustainable hunting, ensuring both populations can thrive in the long term."
