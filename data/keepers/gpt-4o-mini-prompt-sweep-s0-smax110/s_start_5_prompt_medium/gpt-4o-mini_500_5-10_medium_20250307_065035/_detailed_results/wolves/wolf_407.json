This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",

This suggests that there is still room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that supports wolf reproduction while still being cautious about the sheep population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.21, which is only 12.0% of its maximum capacity. While I want to ensure my pack thrives, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, allowing both populations to stabilize without risking a crash."
