            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 161\n- Sheep population: 10.43\n- Wolf population: 29.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.350\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.36 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 9.5% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 94.91, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity while ensuring that we do not deplete their numbers too quickly. This adjustment supports our reproductive needs while maintaining a sustainable balance with the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for some increased hunting intensity without risking depletion. However, I want to ensure that the wolf population remains stable, so I will not push the hunting too aggressively. A moderate increase will help sustain our pack while still allowing the sheep to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual approach is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly, ensuring long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.57, which is only 26.0% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the balance needed for both species",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.72, which is only 20.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for some hunting while prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both sheep and wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.24, which is only 16.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.68, which is only 14.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from the previous theta of 0.40 to 0.35, I can still maintain some hunting activity while prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both populations. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of adapting to changing conditions without causing sudden disruptions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.62, which is only 12.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.23, which is only 11.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain my pack's health.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.26, which is only 10.2% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A gradual increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.74, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from the previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35, I can still focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.43, which is only 9.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.350 to 0.40, I can focus on hunting while still allowing the sheep population to recover. This moderate approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem."
