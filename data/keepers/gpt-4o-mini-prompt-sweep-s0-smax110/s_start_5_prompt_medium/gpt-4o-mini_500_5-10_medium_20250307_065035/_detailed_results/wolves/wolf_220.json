            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 276\n- Sheep population: 110.00\n- Wolf population: 12.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.167\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 9.17 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 100.0% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively low. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain our numbers without depleting the sheep too quickly. This approach allows for a gradual balance, ensuring both populations can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta reflects a cautious approach to capitalize on the high sheep numbers while still considering the need for balance as wolf numbers grow.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution in hunting to prevent depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term balance and recovery of both populations.",

Maintaining a lower theta will help prevent over-exploitation of the sheep and ensure a sustainable balance in the ecosystem, while also allowing the wolf population to stabilize.",

With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 3.93, it is crucial to avoid overhunting to ensure the long-term survival of both species. Maintaining a steady approach will help balance the ecosystem.",

With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 3.55, it is crucial to focus on competition among wolves to maintain a sustainable balance without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and my previous theta was relatively low. A slight increase to 0.30 allows for a balanced approach, enabling sustainable coexistence while still considering the need for hunting. This adjustment will help maintain both wolf and sheep populations without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high at 102.33, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate increase will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover and maintain balance in the ecosystem.",

A moderate approach allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some hunting to support our reproduction. This adjustment helps prevent over-depletion of sheep while keeping our pack strong.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while it is beneficial to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep too quickly. A moderate approach allows for a gradual adjustment while keeping both populations healthy.",

To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly, maintaining a balance that supports sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.64, which is only 21.5% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep too quickly. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.38, which is only 17.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population.
