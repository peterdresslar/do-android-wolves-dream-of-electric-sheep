            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight reduction in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain the balance between wolves and sheep, ensuring both populations can thrive without depleting resources too quickly. A moderate approach will also allow us to adapt to any future changes in population dynamics.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level (32.3% of maximum capacity), and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are fewer sheep per wolf. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I will adopt a moderate hunting intensity that allows for some sheep recovery while still supporting the wolf population. This gradual adjustment will help maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.91, which is only 25.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more moderate hunting intensity is needed to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain its health. A theta of 0.40 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for hunting with the necessity of sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.11, which is only 20.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still focusing on the competition with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.08, which is only 16.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the need for wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.79, which is only 14.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.40 to 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring that both populations can stabilize and thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.91, which is only 12.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.46, which is only 11.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some recovery of the sheep while also ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without risking a crash in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.55, which is only 10.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some reproduction among wolves while still giving sheep a chance to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting sustainability without risking a rapid depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.93, which is only 9.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while being mindful of the growing wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack without depleting the sheep further, promoting a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.55, which is only 9.6% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.43, which is only 9.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable, and a slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A moderate increase to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.44, which is only 9.5% of its maximum capacity. Increasing my hunting intensity too much could lead to a further decline in sheep, jeopardizing future food sources. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting while still considering the need to support the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.54, which is only 9.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing more on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.76, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is a need to allow the sheep to recover. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.63, there is still some hunting potential without risking immediate depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach that supports both wolf population sustainability and sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.09, which is only 10.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. Additionally, with a wolf population of 15, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is already low, indicating that competition among wolves is a concern. A theta of 0.35 allows for a slight focus on hunting while still prioritizing the sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.50, which is only 10.5% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, enabling some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I need to maintain a balance to ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, a slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted to support wolf reproduction. However, I must avoid overexploitation to allow the sheep population to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.57, which is only 11.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while maintaining a healthy wolf population. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help balance our needs with the sustainability of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.17, which is only 12.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for sustainable hunting while still being cautious about the sheep population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.95, which is only 12.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight reduction from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still enabling some hunting to support our population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.82, which is only 13.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.82, which is only 14.4% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, allowing both populations to stabilize without risking a crash."
