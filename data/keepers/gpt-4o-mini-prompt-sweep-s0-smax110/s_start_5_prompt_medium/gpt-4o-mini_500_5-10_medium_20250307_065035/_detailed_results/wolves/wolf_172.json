            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 3.67, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and while I want to increase hunting to support wolf reproduction, I must do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that supports both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high at 104.12, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, the wolf population is also significant at 39.00, so I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A gradual increase to 0.40 allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 93.94, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 47, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term health of both species. This moderate adjustment helps maintain balance as the wolf population grows, ensuring we do not deplete the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep do not become too depleted. A gradual adjustment is key to balancing our needs with the ecosystem",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for some hunting without risking depletion. Given the wolf population is relatively high, a slight reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and allow sheep to recover while still supporting our pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing sheep to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and while I need to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.90, which is only 21.7% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help balance the ecosystem and prevent over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.44, which is only 17.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.66, which is only 15.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our wolf population without depleting the sheep further, promoting a more balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.58, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.10, which is only 11.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep."
