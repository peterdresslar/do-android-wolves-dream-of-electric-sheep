            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that we should maintain a balanced approach to hunting. A moderate theta allows for sustainable coexistence, enabling both sheep and wolves to thrive without depleting resources. This adjustment also considers the growing wolf population, ensuring we do not overhunt while still allowing for some reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A lower theta will help balance competition among wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and while I want to ensure the wolves can thrive, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and prevent over-depletion of the sheep, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 94.9% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 39, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 94.91, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a sustainable balance. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to ensure that both sheep and wolf populations can thrive without depleting resources too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term survival of both species. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to maintain balance, as the wolf population is growing and I want to avoid over-depleting the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 58.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population also being relatively high, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for more hunting while still prioritizing the long-term balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.71, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while I want to increase hunting to support wolf reproduction, I must do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that considers both the current sheep population and the growing wolf numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.57, which is only 26.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while also prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population, ensuring long-term sustainability for both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.72, which is only 20.7% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A gradual increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for sustainable coexistence as we monitor the trends in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.24, which is only 16.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.4 to 0.35 reflects a balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to support reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.68, which is only 14.3% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help me maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability without depleting the sheep further.",
