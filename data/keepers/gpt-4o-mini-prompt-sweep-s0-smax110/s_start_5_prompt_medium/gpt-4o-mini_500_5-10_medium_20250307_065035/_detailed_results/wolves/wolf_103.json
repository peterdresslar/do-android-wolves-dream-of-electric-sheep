            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that they are thriving. However, with a high wolf population, I need to be cautious about overhunting. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will allow for some reproduction among wolves while still giving sheep a chance to recover in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a sustainable balance. This adjustment helps ensure the wolf population remains healthy without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 104.42, which allows for a balanced approach to hunting. This theta value maintains a sustainable coexistence while still enabling some hunting to support the wolf population. Given that the sheep are close to their maximum capacity, a slight reduction in hunting intensity is prudent to avoid depleting their numbers too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 94.91, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This value reflects a balanced approach, promoting sustainable coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the sheep-to-wolf ratio at 1.44, I can maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. This moderate theta allows for gradual adjustments in response to both populations, promoting long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity. This approach helps maintain a balance between the wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term survival while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep. Gradually adjusting my hunting intensity will allow for adaptation to future changes in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.71, I need to be cautious about overhunting to ensure the long-term survival of both species. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 37.27, which is only 33.9% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A moderate increase from my previous theta of 0.400 will help maintain a balance as the sheep population recovers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.57, which is only 26.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight reduction in hunting intensity allows for a more sustainable balance, giving sheep a chance to recover while still enabling wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.72, which is only 20.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the immediate needs of the wolf pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.24, which is only 16.6% of its maximum capacity. While I want to ensure the wolves can thrive, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.68, which is only 14.3% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.62, which is only 12.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.23, which is only 11.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.400 to 0.35, I can focus on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring a sustainable balance."
