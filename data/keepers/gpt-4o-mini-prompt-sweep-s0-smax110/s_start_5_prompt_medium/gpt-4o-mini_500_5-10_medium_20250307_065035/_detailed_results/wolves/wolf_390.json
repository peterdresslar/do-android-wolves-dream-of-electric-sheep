            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 444\n- Sheep population: 9.71\n- Wolf population: 28.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.300\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.35 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 8.8% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 84.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with a wolf population of 50, it is important to avoid overhunting to ensure both populations can thrive. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while also considering the need for competition among wolves, promoting a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a balance as the sheep population is still below maximum capacity, while also considering the growing wolf population. A gradual increase aligns with the wisdom of adapting to current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still being mindful of the sheep's recovery. A gradual increase aligns with the current trends and avoids sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 39.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 73, I need to be cautious about overhunting. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, allowing both populations to thrive without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and while it is important to maintain a balance, a slight increase in hunting intensity will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. This adjustment allows for a gradual response to the current conditions while keeping an eye on the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.18, which is only 22.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our needs without depleting the sheep further, promoting a healthier balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.27, which is only 17.5% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to help sustain our population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A gradual increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, allowing us to adapt to the current conditions while still being mindful of the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.11, which is only 14.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is some room for hunting, it is crucial to avoid overexploitation to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.78, which is only 12.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to be cautious with our hunting to allow the sheep to recover. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.26, there is still a need for some hunting to support our wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while being mindful of the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.29, which is only 11.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A slight decrease from my previous theta will help maintain a balance, ensuring that both sheep and wolves can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.47, which is only 9.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support the wolf population. A theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, reducing pressure on the sheep while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.99, which is only 9.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.31, focusing on competition with other wolves will help stabilize our population while giving the sheep a chance to increase. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid sudden population crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we need to be cautious about hunting intensity. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still giving sheep a chance to recover."
