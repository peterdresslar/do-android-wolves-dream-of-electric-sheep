            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 228\n- Sheep population: 11.98\n- Wolf population: 39.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.400\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.31 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 10.9% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring sustainable coexistence while also allowing for some growth in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 93.94, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while ensuring that the sheep population does not decline too rapidly. A gradual increase aligns with the current trends and maintains a balance between competing with other wolves and hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 81.45, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are enough sheep to support a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This slight increase from my previous theta allows for sustainable coexistence while still considering the need to adapt to the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while I want to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 47.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 68, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 36.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, the wolf population is relatively high, and I need to be cautious to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still providing enough sustenance for the wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and while it is important to maintain a balance, I need to ensure that the wolf population remains healthy. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help support wolf reproduction while still allowing for some recovery of the sheep population. This adjustment is gradual and considers the current state of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.90, which is only 21.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A slight decrease from my previous theta of 0.45 will help balance our needs without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.44, which is only 17.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance, enabling sustainable coexistence without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.66, which is only 15.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach to hunting while still considering the need to compete with other wolves as our population is relatively high.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.58, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach that balances our need for sustenance with the long-term health of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.10, which is only 11.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.98, which is only 10.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is a need to hunt for sustenance, a more moderate approach will allow the sheep to recover and maintain a balance in the ecosystem. Gradually reducing hunting intensity will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep."
