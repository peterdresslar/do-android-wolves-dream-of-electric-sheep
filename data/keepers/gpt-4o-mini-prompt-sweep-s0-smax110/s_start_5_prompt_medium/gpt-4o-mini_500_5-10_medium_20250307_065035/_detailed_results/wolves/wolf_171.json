            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at its maximum capacity, and while I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A moderate hunting intensity will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that we should maintain a balanced approach to hunting. A moderate theta allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some hunting to support our wolf population. This adjustment helps prevent over-depletion of sheep and allows for gradual recovery of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 94.7% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. However, with the wolf population at 39, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep. This moderate adjustment will help maintain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a balance as the wolf population grows, ensuring both species can thrive together.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while ensuring that the sheep population can recover and thrive. A gradual increase in theta helps maintain balance without risking a sudden depletion of sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 47.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. A moderate approach allows for a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring both populations can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that can support both wolf reproduction and sheep recovery. This approach helps maintain balance in the ecosystem without risking a depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level (28.0% of maximum capacity), and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are fewer sheep available per wolf. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to adopt a balanced approach that allows for some hunting while also considering the need for sheep recovery. A moderate theta of 0.45 will help maintain a sustainable cycle without depleting the sheep population too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.90, which is only 21.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.44, which is only 17.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is some room for hunting, I need to be cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and my previous theta was already on the lower side. A slight increase to 0.40 allows for a more balanced approach to hunting while still considering the need for sheep recovery. This adjustment helps maintain a sustainable cycle without risking a rapid decline in sheep numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.58, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",
