            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 92.1% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help ensure the wolf population remains healthy without depleting the sheep too quickly. A moderate approach allows for sustainable coexistence as both populations can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 90.42, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment helps support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. It reflects a cautious approach to ensure both populations can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 70% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for increased hunting without risking depletion. However, the wolf population is also significant, so a moderate increase in hunting intensity allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the sheep population at 55.5% of its maximum capacity and the wolf population slightly higher than the sheep, a moderate theta will help maintain stability while allowing for gradual adjustments as conditions change.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 42.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 70, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 32.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for gradual hunting without risking depletion. With the wolf population at 70, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.91, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help sustain my pack while still considering the need for sheep recovery. A gradual increase is prudent to maintain balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the wolf population is relatively high. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to thrive. This moderate approach helps maintain balance and avoids depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.08, which is only 16.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.4 to 0.35, I can focus on maintaining a balance that supports both the wolf population and the sheep, avoiding overhunting while still allowing for some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.79, which is only 14.4% of its maximum capacity. Given the sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.30, it is crucial to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population. A lower theta will help prevent overhunting and promote a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.91, which is only 12.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is some room for hunting, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach that supports wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.46, which is only 11.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is an opportunity to increase hunting intensity slightly to help sustain wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A gradual increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without risking a rapid depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.55, which is only 10.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 reflects a balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.93, which is only 9.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is a need to allow the sheep to recover. However, with a wolf population of 33.00, I must also ensure that we maintain our numbers. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting to support reproduction."
