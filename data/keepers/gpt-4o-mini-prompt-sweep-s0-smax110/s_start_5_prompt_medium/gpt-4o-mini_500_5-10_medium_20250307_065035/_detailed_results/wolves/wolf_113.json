            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 160\n- Sheep population: 10.74\n- Wolf population: 33.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.350\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.33 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 9.8% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competition with other wolves while ensuring the sheep population has a chance to stabilize and grow, promoting long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 94.91, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover and thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term health of both populations. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to ensure that the sheep can recover while also allowing the wolf population to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery. A gradual increase aligns with the current trends and maintains balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 33.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.53, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.57, which is only 26.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is a need to hunt to support the wolf population, we must be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting sustainable coexistence while still enabling some hunting to support reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.72, which is only 20.7% of its maximum capacity. While I want to ensure the survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to be cautious about hunting intensity. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a more balanced approach, giving the sheep a chance to recover while still allowing for some hunting to sustain the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.24, which is only 16.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting to sustain the wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 reflects a balanced strategy that prioritizes the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.68, which is only 14.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach that supports wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.62, which is only 12.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.400 to 0.350, I can maintain a balance that focuses on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",

While I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. A slight increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.26, which is only 10.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep population while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our own health. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking a rapid decline in sheep numbers, ensuring a more sustainable balance.",
