            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 83.9% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 78.74, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the balance needed for sustainability. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to ensure that both sheep and wolf populations can thrive without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment reflects a balance between ensuring my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. While I want to maintain a healthy wolf population, I also need to ensure that the sheep can recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity allows for a more balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 36.33, which is only 33.0% of its maximum capacity. While I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.26, which is only 24.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should maintain a moderate hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while also ensuring that our wolf population remains healthy. A theta of 0.40 strikes a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.30, which is only 19.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is some opportunity for hunting, it is crucial to maintain a balance to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 will enable me to focus on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring the long-term survival of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.62, which is only 16.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while I need to be cautious about overhunting, a slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted to ensure the wolf population can thrive. By adjusting theta to 0.40, I can maintain a balance that allows for some hunting while still considering the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.01, which is only 13.6% of its maximum capacity. While I want to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I also recognize the need to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 to 0.35 reflects a balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.27, which is only 12.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain our wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach while still considering the need for competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.02, which is only 10.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for wolf survival while giving sheep a chance to increase their numbers. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.20, which is only 10.2% of its maximum capacity. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while also addressing the competition among wolves. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.73, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure my pack can thrive, I must also allow the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.300 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.51, which is only 9.6% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and avoid depleting their numbers further, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting. This will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem and ensure both populations can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.40, which is only 9.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased slightly, it is important to remain cautious and avoid overhunting. A small increase to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach that supports both the wolf population and the recovery of sheep."
