            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 290\n- Sheep population: 61.74\n- Wolf population: 65.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.485\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.95 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 56.1% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to thrive. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly, ensuring long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.75, which is only 26.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a presence in the hunting cycle. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep further, promoting a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.64, which is only 21.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some reproduction among wolves while still giving sheep a chance to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep population too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.38, which is only 17.6% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. This adjustment will help balance the ecosystem and prevent over-depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.79, which is only 15.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is potential for recovery in the sheep population if I maintain a moderate hunting intensity. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.35 to 0.40, I can balance the need for hunting to support the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover sustainably. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.68, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is an opportunity to hunt, I should prioritize a more cautious approach to allow the sheep population to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.39, which is only 12.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting without risking depletion. However, with a wolf population of 42.00, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting sustainability while still enabling some hunting.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.98, which is only 10.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some sustainable hunting. This will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem and ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.90, which is only 9.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help ensure the sheep population stabilizes while also allowing for a gradual adjustment in the wolf population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
