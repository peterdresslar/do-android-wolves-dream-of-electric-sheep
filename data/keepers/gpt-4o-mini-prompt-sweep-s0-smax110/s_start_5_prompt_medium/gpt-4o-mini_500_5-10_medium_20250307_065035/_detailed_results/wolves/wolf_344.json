By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This approach aligns with the wisdom of making gradual adjustments and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and while it is important to increase hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must also be cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.08, which is only 16.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be slightly increased to support wolf reproduction, it is crucial to avoid overhunting to allow the sheep population to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still enabling some hunting.",

A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for more hunting to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious about the sheep population",
