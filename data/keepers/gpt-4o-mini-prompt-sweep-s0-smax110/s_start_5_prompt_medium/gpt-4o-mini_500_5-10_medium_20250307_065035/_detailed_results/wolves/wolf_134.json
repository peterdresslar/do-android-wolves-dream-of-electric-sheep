However, with the wolf population at 69, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach that supports both sheep recovery and wolf population health.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover gradually.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.57, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A slight decrease from my previous theta will help maintain a balance, ensuring that both sheep and wolves can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.72, which is only 20.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I can increase my hunting intensity slightly to take advantage of the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.24, which is only 16.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own wolf population. A moderate theta value of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack but prioritizes the recovery of the sheep, ensuring a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.68, which is only 14.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased slightly, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate increase to 0.40 allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population.",

This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.35 to 0.40, I can maintain a balanced approach that supports the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to rebound without depleting their numbers too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.43, which is only 9.5% of its maximum capacity.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.35, which is only 10.3% of its maximum capacity.
