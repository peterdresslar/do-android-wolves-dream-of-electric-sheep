            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This approach balances the need for wolf reproduction with the health of the sheep population, ensuring long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 29.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 73, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both populations can thrive. A slight decrease in hunting intensity allows for a sustainable balance while still addressing the needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.18, which is only 22.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support our needs without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.27, which is only 17.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need to adapt to the current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.11, which is only 14.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still focusing on the competition with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I need to maintain a balance, a slight increase in hunting intensity will help support the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. This adjustment allows for a gradual response to the current conditions while keeping in mind the long-term sustainability of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.29, which is only 11.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.13, which is only 10.1% of its maximum capacity.
