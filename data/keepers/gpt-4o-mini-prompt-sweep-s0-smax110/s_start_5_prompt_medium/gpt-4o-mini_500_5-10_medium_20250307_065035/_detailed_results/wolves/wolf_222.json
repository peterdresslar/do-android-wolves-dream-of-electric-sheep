            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to prevent depletion. A theta of 0.4 allows for a balanced approach, ensuring that both sheep and wolf populations can sustain themselves while avoiding overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. With a high sheep-to-wolf ratio and a growing wolf population, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery. Maintaining a lower theta helps ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, as it prevents overhunting and promotes a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. With a higher wolf population, focusing on competition among wolves will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep further. A gradual adjustment is necessary to ensure long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at its maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. A moderate approach will help maintain a balance between the wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term survival for both.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be cautiously increased to prevent over-depletion. However, with the wolf population at 25, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 3.93, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderate to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring both populations can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover and thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 93% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a sustainable balance. This adjustment will help support the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A gradual increase is prudent to avoid sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 91.40, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual increase aligns with the current trends and ensures a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 56.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.95, a slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow for a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a sustainable balance. This adjustment reflects the need to support wolf reproduction without over-depleting the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 33.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 69, which is relatively high, I need to be cautious about overhunting. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.75, which is only 26.1% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.64, which is only 21.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.38, which is only 17.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is some opportunity for hunting, it is important to prioritize the recovery of the sheep population to ensure long-term sustainability. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, which is necessary given the current wolf population of 58. This approach aims to balance the needs of both species."
