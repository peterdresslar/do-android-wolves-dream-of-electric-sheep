            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 371\n- Sheep population: 10.93\n- Wolf population: 33.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.350\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.33 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 9.9% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 101.27, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 42.00, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently healthy at 90.42, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. It is important to maintain a balance as the wolf population is stable, and a gradual increase in hunting will support reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 70% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and sustain their numbers in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the sheep population at 55.5% of its maximum capacity, I can afford to maintain a moderate hunting intensity to ensure sustainable coexistence while also allowing for some recovery of the sheep population. This adjustment will help prevent over-depletion and support the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the wolf population is relatively high. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still providing enough resources for the wolves. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level relative to the maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain their numbers. This moderate approach helps ensure long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.91, which is only 25.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for more hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term survival of both species. This adjustment is small and aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.11, which is only 20.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some reproduction among wolves while still enabling the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.08, which is only 16.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. Additionally, with a wolf population of 58.00, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is low at 0.31, suggesting that focusing on competition among wolves is necessary to maintain balance. A theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.79, which is only 14.4% of its maximum capacity. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover while also addressing the growing wolf population. This balance is crucial for the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.91, which is only 12.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some reproduction among wolves while still giving sheep a chance to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.46, which is only 11.3% of its maximum capacity. While I need to increase my hunting intensity to ensure the survival of my pack, I must do so gradually to avoid depleting the sheep population further. A theta of 0.40 allows for a slight increase in hunting while still considering the long-term sustainability of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.55, which is only 10.5% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.93, which is only 9.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that supports both populations."
