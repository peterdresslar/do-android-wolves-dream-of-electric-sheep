This suggests that while I can increase hunting intensity slightly, I should still prioritize a balanced approach to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.40 reflects a cautious increase in hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable ecosystem.",

This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",

This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still being cautious. A moderate increase to 0.40 will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can recover over time.",

This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population.
