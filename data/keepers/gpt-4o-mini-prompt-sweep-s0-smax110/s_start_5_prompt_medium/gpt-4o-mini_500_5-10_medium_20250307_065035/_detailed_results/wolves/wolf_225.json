This approach also helps to stabilize the wolf population as we face competition from other wolves.",

This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring both can thrive in the long term.",

This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of adapting to changing conditions without making sudden shifts.",

A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain balance while still allowing for some hunting.",
