            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is close to its maximum capacity, indicating that we should be cautious with our hunting to avoid depleting their numbers too quickly. A moderate increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover and prevent overexploitation. This moderate approach will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at its maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both populations.",

To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition with other wolves. A gradual decrease in hunting will help maintain balance without risking a crash in either population.",

This small adjustment reflects a balanced approach, considering both the current sheep population and the need to avoid over-depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 94.91, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. It reflects a cautious approach to ensure both populations can thrive.",

This value reflects a balanced approach, ensuring that both sheep and wolf populations can thrive together while also considering the recent growth in wolf numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 69, which is relatively high, I need to be cautious about overhunting. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 33.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 70, which is relatively high, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.57, which is only 26.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further.
