            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 443\n- Sheep population: 9.99\n- Wolf population: 32.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.350\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.31 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 9.1% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because it represents a balanced approach to hunting and competition. With the sheep population at 93.14 and the wolf population at 50.00, a moderate theta allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some hunting to support wolf reproduction. This adjustment acknowledges the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need to avoid over-depleting the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 70.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, the wolf population is also significant at 59, so I need to be cautious not to overhunt. A slight increase to 0.55 allows for more hunting to support wolf reproduction while still maintaining a balance to avoid depleting the sheep population too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicating a slight competition for resources, a moderate theta will help maintain the sheep population while allowing for some hunting to support wolf reproduction. This adjustment is gradual, aligning with the wisdom of adapting to changing conditions without causing sudden shifts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 39.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 73, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.13, which is only 29.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be slightly increased to support wolf reproduction, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A small increase to 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for sustainable cycles.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.18, which is only 22.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance, reducing pressure on the sheep while still allowing for some hunting to support our needs.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be increased slightly to support wolf reproduction while still allowing for some recovery of the sheep population. This moderate increase aligns with the need for balance and sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.11, which is only 14.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is potential for recovery in the sheep population if I focus more on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting while still prioritizing the sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.78, which is only 12.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also maintaining a healthy wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach to hunting, ensuring we do not deplete the sheep further while still allowing for some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.29, which is only 11.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from the previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35, I can still maintain a balance that allows for some hunting while prioritizing the long-term survival of both populations. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of avoiding sudden changes and responding to the current state of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.13, which is only 10.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.47, which is only 9.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow the sheep to recover while still providing for the wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.99, which is only 9.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.35 to 0.40, I can still focus on maintaining a healthy wolf population while allowing for some sustainable hunting. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of adapting to the current conditions without risking a crash in either population."
