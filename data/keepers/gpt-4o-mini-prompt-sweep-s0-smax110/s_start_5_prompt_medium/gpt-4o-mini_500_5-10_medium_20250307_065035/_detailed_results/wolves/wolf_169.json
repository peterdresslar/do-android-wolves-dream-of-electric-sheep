            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at its maximum capacity, indicating that we need to moderate our hunting intensity to allow for recovery and sustainability. A theta of 0.6 strikes a balance between hunting and allowing the sheep population to stabilize, ensuring the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A moderate theta value will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can stabilize, promoting long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that we should be cautious with our hunting intensity to avoid depleting their numbers too quickly. A slight reduction from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, enabling both sheep recovery and sustainable wolf population growth.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 94.7% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 93.94, allowing for a moderate hunting approach that ensures sustainability. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 2.00, I can afford to focus slightly more on competition with other wolves to maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing for some hunting to support reproduction. This gradual adjustment helps avoid sudden population crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover and maintain balance. It",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to maintain balance while still ensuring the wolf population can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 47.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 68, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both populations can thrive. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that supports reproduction while still considering the long-term health of the ecosystem.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 30.82, which is only 28.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I can increase my hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. A moderate increase to 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.90, which is only 21.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population and maintaining a balance with the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.44, which is only 17.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low at 16.66, which is only 15.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I need to maintain a focus on hunting to support the wolf population, I should do so cautiously to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, promoting sustainability while still recognizing the need for hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.58, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.4 to 0.35, I can maintain a focus on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring that both populations can stabilize and thrive in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.10, which is only 11.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some reproduction among wolves while still giving sheep a chance to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without risking a rapid depletion of the sheep population."
