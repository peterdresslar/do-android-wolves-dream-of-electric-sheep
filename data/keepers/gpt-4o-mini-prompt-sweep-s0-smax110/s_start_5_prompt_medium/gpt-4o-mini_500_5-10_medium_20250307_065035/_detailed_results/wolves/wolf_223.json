            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating a need for careful management to prevent depletion. A moderate hunting intensity allows for some reproduction among wolves while also giving sheep a chance to recover, maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at its maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A moderate theta value will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can stabilize, promoting long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 5.79, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 5.24, it is crucial to focus on competition among wolves to ensure our population remains stable while giving sheep a chance to rebound.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover and ensures the long-term sustainability of both populations. It is crucial to avoid sudden changes and focus on gradual adjustments.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and while I need to ensure my pack",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. With a high sheep-to-wolf ratio, focusing on competition among wolves will help maintain our population while giving sheep a chance to rebound.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and while I want to increase hunting to ensure wolf reproduction, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A moderate increase to 0.30 will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep, promoting sustainability in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 93% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that sheep can recover if needed. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the balance between wolves and sheep. This moderate adjustment will help maintain the sheep population and allow for gradual wolf population growth without risking depletion of resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This will help support wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid destabilizing the ecosystem.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover and thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.75, which is only 26.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack without depleting the sheep further, promoting a more balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.64, which is only 21.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be slightly increased to support wolf reproduction, it is crucial to avoid overhunting to allow the sheep population to recover. A small increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach that considers both the current state of the ecosystem and the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.38, which is only 17.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is an opportunity to hunt, I need to be cautious and avoid overexploitation. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population, ensuring a sustainable balance."
