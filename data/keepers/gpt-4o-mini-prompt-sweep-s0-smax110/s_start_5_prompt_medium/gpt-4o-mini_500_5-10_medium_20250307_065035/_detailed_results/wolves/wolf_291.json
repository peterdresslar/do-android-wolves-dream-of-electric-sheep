            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at maximum capacity, indicating a need for careful management. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will allow for some reproduction among wolves while still giving sheep a chance to recover. This approach balances the immediate need for sustenance with the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. With a high sheep-to-wolf ratio, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. A moderate theta value will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can stabilize, promoting long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition with other wolves. A lower theta will help maintain balance and prevent overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. With a high sheep-to-wolf ratio and a growing wolf population, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition with other wolves. This approach supports long-term sustainability and avoids depleting the sheep population further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderate to allow for recovery while still ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking over-depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 101.27, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while maintaining a sustainable balance with the sheep population, which is currently at 92.1% of its maximum capacity. A gradual increase helps avoid sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 90.42, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to maintain balance, as the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we are not yet in a critical state. Gradually reducing hunting intensity will help prevent over-depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 70% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with a wolf population of 58, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while I want to ensure my pack thrives, I also recognize the need to allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and prevent depletion of the sheep population, which is crucial for our long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 42.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 70, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.49, which is only 32.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is some room for hunting, it is crucial to avoid overexploitation to allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease from my previous theta of 0.450 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.91, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.11, which is only 20.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is room for growth in the sheep population, I need to be cautious about hunting intensity to allow them to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep can thrive, promoting long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery.
