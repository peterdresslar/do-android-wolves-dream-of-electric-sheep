            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that while they can sustain some hunting, we must be cautious not to deplete their numbers too quickly. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will allow for some reproduction among wolves while still giving sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly. A moderate adjustment is necessary to ensure sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, but the wolf population is also significant. A moderate approach allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some hunting to support wolf reproduction. This adjustment helps prevent over-depletion of sheep and maintains balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while I want to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I also need to allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain balance without risking a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 47.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 68, I need to be cautious not to overhunt and risk depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still considering the long-term balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term survival of both species. This adjustment will help maintain a balance as the sheep population grows, ensuring that we do not deplete their numbers too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.90, which is only 21.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I can increase my hunting intensity slightly, I need to be cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. A theta of 0.40 allows for a modest increase in hunting while still prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.44, which is only 17.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover while still ensuring the wolf population remains stable. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the long-term balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.66, which is only 15.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that the sheep can recover if I reduce my hunting intensity slightly. By increasing theta to 0.40, I can still maintain some hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.58, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population and maintaining a balance with the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.10, which is only 11.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for moderate hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.98, which is only 10.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance."
