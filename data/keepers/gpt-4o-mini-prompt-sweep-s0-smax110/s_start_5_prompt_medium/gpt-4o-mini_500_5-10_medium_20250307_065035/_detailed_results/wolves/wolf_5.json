            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A theta of 0.45 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 5.27, which is only 4.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize while still maintaining a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 5.60, which is only 5.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while being mindful of the need to avoid over-depleting the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we are nearing a critical point for sustainability. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain its health. This moderate approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and supports long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 6.41, which is only 5.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 6.88, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. A moderate increase to 0.45 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for sustainable coexistence while still considering the need to support the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 7.41, which is only 6.7% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance and avoid depleting the sheep further, while still allowing for some hunting to support wolf reproduction."
