            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicating a healthy number of sheep per wolf, I can maintain a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep population can recover and thrive. This gradual adjustment helps avoid overexploitation and promotes long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balanced approach. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly. It reflects a cautious strategy that considers both immediate needs and long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with a wolf population of 69, it",

However, with the wolf population at 70, which is relatively high, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.57, which is only 26.0% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, allowing for sustainable coexistence while still addressing the needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.72, which is only 20.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for more hunting to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious to avoid overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.24, which is only 16.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance, allowing for some hunting while prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both species.",
