            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 101.27, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still focusing on competition with other wolves. This moderate adjustment helps maintain a balance, allowing sheep to recover while ensuring the wolf population remains stable.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 90.42, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while ensuring that the sheep can recover. This moderate adjustment helps maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep, promoting coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 70% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.33, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly, considering the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need for gradual changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the wolf population is relatively high. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain the sheep population while allowing for some growth in the wolf population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and responding to current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain our wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid destabilizing the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.91, which is only 25.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the long-term balance of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.11, which is only 20.1% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still being cautious. A moderate increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, enabling us to sustain our wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. It also allows for gradual adaptation to the changing conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.08, which is only 16.4% of its maximum capacity. While I want to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I also need to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing competition with other wolves, ensuring a balance that supports both populations in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.79, which is only 14.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach that supports both wolf reproduction and the recovery of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.91, which is only 12.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support our wolf population without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.46, which is only 11.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.55, which is only 10.5% of its maximum capacity. A moderate hunting intensity will allow for some hunting while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This approach helps maintain a balance between the wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term survival for both.",
