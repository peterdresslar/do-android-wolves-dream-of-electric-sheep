            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.13, which is only 29.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is some room for hunting, it is essential to be cautious and avoid over-depleting the sheep. A slight reduction from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that helps maintain both populations without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.18, which is only 22.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that I can increase my hunting intensity slightly to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A gradual increase to 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.27, which is only 17.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing our need for sustenance with the necessity of not depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.11, which is only 14.6% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will enable me to hunt more effectively while still prioritizing the sustainability of both populations. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
