            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 367\n- Sheep population: 15.79\n- Wolf population: 53.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.350\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.30 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 14.4% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution in hunting to prevent depletion. A moderate approach allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some hunting to support the wolf population. This adjustment reflects the need to balance our numbers with the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at its maximum capacity, indicating that we should be cautious with our hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate approach will help maintain a balance between our population and the sheep, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both populations and avoids depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that they can sustain a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. A gradual increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach that supports wolf reproduction while still considering the long-term health of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still healthy at 101.27, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 42.00, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 90.42, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance. This adjustment will help maintain a sustainable coexistence as the wolf population is stable, and I want to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 70% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, but the wolf population is slightly high. A small reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to thrive. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still considering the long-term balance of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level relative to its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are fewer sheep available per wolf. This suggests a need for a moderate approach to hunting that allows the sheep population to recover while still ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. A gradual increase in hunting intensity is warranted as the sheep population grows, but for now, a slight reduction in hunting will help maintain balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.91, which allows for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking their long-term survival. This adjustment will help balance the needs of the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual increase is essential to avoid sudden population crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.11, which is only 20.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to allow for sheep recovery while also considering the growing wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, ensuring that both populations can thrive without depleting resources too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.08, which is only 16.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.4 to 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for wolf sustenance while ensuring the sheep population can stabilize and grow.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.79, which is only 14.4% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, a slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted to allow for some recovery of the sheep population without depleting it too quickly. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep.",
