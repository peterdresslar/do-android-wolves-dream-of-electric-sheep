            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 52.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 69, which is relatively high, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves while allowing the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.3 strikes a balance that supports both populations without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 29.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 73, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both populations can thrive. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the health of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.18, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A slight decrease from my previous theta will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can stabilize and grow.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.27, which is only 17.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for the sheep to recover. By setting a theta of 0.35, I can focus slightly more on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting. This approach will help maintain a balance that supports both wolf and sheep populations in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.11, which is only 14.6% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still being cautious. A moderate increase to 0.40 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring both populations can thrive in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.78, which is only 12.5% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.29, which is only 11.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.13, which is only 10.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting a lower theta, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of avoiding sudden changes and adapting to the current ecosystem state.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low at 10.47, which is only 9.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while we need to be cautious about overhunting, a slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted to ensure our survival and reproduction. A theta of 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling us to respond to the current low sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.99, which is only 9.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to allow the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 will help maintain a balance, allowing for some hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.71, which is only 8.8% of its maximum capacity. While I want to increase my hunting intensity to ensure the survival of my pack, I must do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep population further. A slight increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still giving sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.54, which is only 8.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring a sustainable balance.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.36, which is only 9.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should be cautious with our hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still being mindful of the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.80, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some reproduction among wolves while still giving sheep a chance to recover.
