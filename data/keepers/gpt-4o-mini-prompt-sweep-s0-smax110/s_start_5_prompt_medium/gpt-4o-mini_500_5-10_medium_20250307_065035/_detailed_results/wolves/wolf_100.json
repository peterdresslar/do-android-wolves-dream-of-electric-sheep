            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A lower theta will help reduce competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to stabilize, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. A moderate approach will help maintain a balance between the wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term survival for both.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that we can afford to increase our hunting intensity slightly. However, given the current wolf population and the need to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly, a moderate increase allows for sustainable coexistence while still promoting wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while ensuring we do not deplete their numbers too quickly. This adjustment reflects a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while allowing sheep to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a moderate hunting approach that supports both wolf reproduction and sheep recovery. This adjustment reflects a cautious strategy to maintain balance, as the wolf population is also growing. A slight decrease from my previous theta will help prevent overhunting while still allowing for some hunting to sustain our pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 80.73, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while maintaining a sustainable balance with the sheep population. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.44, a moderate increase in theta will help ensure both populations can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while it is beneficial to hunt to ensure wolf reproduction, I need to be cautious not to deplete the sheep too quickly. A slight decrease in hunting intensity allows for a more balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the gradual increase in sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without overly depleting the sheep population, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and while I need to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.57, which is only 26.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting strategy. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our wolf population without depleting the sheep further, promoting a healthier balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.72, which is only 20.7% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A gradual increase to 0.40 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for sustenance with the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.24, which is only 16.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.68, which is only 14.3% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 to 0.40 reflects a cautious approach to hunting, balancing the need for sustenance with the importance of maintaining a sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.62, which is only 12.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population.
