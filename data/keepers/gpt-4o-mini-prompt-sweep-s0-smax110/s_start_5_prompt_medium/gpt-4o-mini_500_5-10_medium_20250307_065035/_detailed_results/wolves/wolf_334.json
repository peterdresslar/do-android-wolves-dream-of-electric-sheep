            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 361\n- Sheep population: 61.08\n- Wolf population: 65.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.004\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.94 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 55.5% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

This adjustment reflects a balanced approach, enabling sustainable coexistence while also considering the growth of the wolf population.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.91, which is only 25.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I need to be cautious about hunting too intensely, I can afford to focus slightly more on competition with other wolves to allow the sheep population to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a balanced approach that prioritizes the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.11, which is only 20.1% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain balance and avoid sudden changes that could disrupt the ecosystem.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.79, which is only 14.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase to 0.40 allows for some hunting while still considering the need for sheep recovery and the overall balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.91, which is only 12.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for the sheep to recover without depleting their numbers too quickly. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.46, which is only 11.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that I should focus on a balanced approach to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining some hunting intensity to support the wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help adapt to the current conditions without risking a rapid depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.55, which is only 10.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35, I can still maintain some hunting activity while prioritizing the long-term balance and survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.93, which is only 9.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is a need for cautious hunting to allow the sheep to recover. However, with a wolf population of 33, I must also ensure that my pack remains healthy. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for sustainable hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.55, which is only 9.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 maintains a focus on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, promoting a gradual balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.43, which is only 9.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still being mindful of the need to avoid overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.44, which is only 9.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population without depleting the sheep further.",

A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 reflects a balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to support our population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively low at 11.09, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking their depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a balance as the wolf population is also present at 15.00. A moderate increase to 0.40 reflects a cautious approach to ensure both populations can thrive over time.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a potential strain on resources. By slightly reducing hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while still competing with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a balance and adapting to the current ecosystem state.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and my previous theta of 0.35 indicates a cautious approach. However, with the sheep population at 12.03 and the wolf population at 12.00, I can afford to increase my hunting intensity slightly to 0.40. This adjustment allows for a more sustainable balance while still being mindful of the need to avoid over-depleting the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.57, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery. A gradual increase helps maintain balance and avoids sudden population crashes."
