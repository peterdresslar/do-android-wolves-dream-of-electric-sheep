            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 443\n- Sheep population: 9.99\n- Wolf population: 32.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.300\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.31 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 9.1% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 93.14, allowing for a moderate hunting approach. This will help maintain a sustainable balance while also considering the growing wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting without risking depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help sustain our wolf population while still considering the need for sheep recovery. A gradual increase keeps the balance stable and avoids over-depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 52.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 69, which is relatively high, I need to focus on maintaining balance. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow sheep to recover while also preventing overcompetition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep too quickly. A moderate increase allows for a balance that can adapt to future changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.13, which is only 29.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is some room for hunting, it is crucial to avoid overexploitation. A moderate increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.18, which is only 22.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is potential for growth in the sheep population if I reduce hunting intensity slightly. By increasing theta to 0.45, I can still maintain some hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.27, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low at 0.30. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep population to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to ensure our survival. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.11, which is only 14.6% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still being cautious. A theta of 0.40 represents a balanced approach that acknowledges the need for sustainable coexistence, allowing the sheep population to recover while also ensuring the wolf population remains healthy.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.78, which is only 12.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need to compete with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to support our population without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.29, which is only 11.2% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking the depletion of the sheep population. A gradual increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for sustainable coexistence while still considering the growth of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.13, which is only 10.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to ensure our own survival. A theta of 0.35 represents a slight increase from my previous value, reflecting a cautious approach to hunting as the sheep population begins to stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.47, which is only 9.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover, rather than intensifying hunting. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and ensure that both wolves and sheep can thrive in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.99, which is only 9.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a slight focus on hunting to support our wolf population. A moderate increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while being mindful of the sheep"
