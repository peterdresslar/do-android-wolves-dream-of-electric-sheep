            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 85.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep. However, my previous theta was very low, and the wolf population is also relatively stable. A moderate theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still enabling the sheep population to recover and maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is key to avoiding drastic fluctuations in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain the balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring both can thrive without depleting resources too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 47.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 68, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the wolf population is relatively high. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain their numbers. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for a balanced coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 30.82, which is only 28.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done gradually to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for more hunting while still considering the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.90, which is only 21.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.450 to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, focusing on sustainable coexistence while still considering the need for wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.44, which is only 17.7% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for some hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.66, which is only 15.1% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.58, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting for the wolves. A theta of 0.35 reflects a moderate balance, allowing for sustainable coexistence without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.10, which is only 11.9% of its maximum capacity. Increasing my hunting intensity slightly to 0.40 allows for a more balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. This adjustment aligns with the need to maintain a sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.98, which is only 10.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A slight decrease from my previous theta will help balance our needs with the sustainability of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.28, which is only 10.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.78, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a moderate approach, balancing the need to compete with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to sustain our population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.65, which is only 9.7% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensifying hunting. This will allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a sustainable balance."
