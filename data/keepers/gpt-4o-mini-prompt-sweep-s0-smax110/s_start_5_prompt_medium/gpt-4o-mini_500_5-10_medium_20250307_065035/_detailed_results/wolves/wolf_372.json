            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 439\n- Sheep population: 13.78\n- Wolf population: 52.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.350\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.26 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 12.5% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. This lower theta will help balance competition among wolves while preventing overhunting of sheep, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 3.33, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that a more cautious approach is needed to prevent overhunting. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from the previous theta, I can still support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 93.8% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still ensuring that the sheep population can recover and remain sustainable. A gradual increase aligns with the wisdom of maintaining balance and adapting to the current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 93.14, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 50.00, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help sustain our wolf population while still considering the long-term health of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while I want to ensure my pack thrives, I also recognize the need to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate approach will help maintain balance as the wolf population is relatively high, and it is essential to avoid overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still maintaining a balance that prevents over-depletion of the sheep population. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the trends in both populations, a gradual increase in theta aligns with my objectives for long-term survival and coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 29.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 73, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both species can thrive. A moderate adjustment to 0.45 allows for some hunting while still focusing on the competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.18, which is only 22.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing our wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack without depleting the sheep further, promoting a balance that can lead to long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.27, which is only 17.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.11, which is only 14.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support our wolf population without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.78, which is only 12.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.29, which is only 11.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is a need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support the wolf population without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance."
