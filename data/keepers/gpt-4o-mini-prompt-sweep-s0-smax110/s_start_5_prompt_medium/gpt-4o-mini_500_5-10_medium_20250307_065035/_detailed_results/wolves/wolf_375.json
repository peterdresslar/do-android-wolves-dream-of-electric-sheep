            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 441\n- Sheep population: 11.13\n- Wolf population: 41.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.400\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.27 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 10.1% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that they can sustain a moderate increase in hunting intensity. A theta of 0.75 allows for continued reproduction among wolves while ensuring that the sheep population does not deplete too quickly. This balance supports both species in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 93.8% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover sustainably. A gradual approach is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that can support wolf reproduction while still enabling the sheep to recover. This balance helps maintain the ecosystem without risking a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance and avoid over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 52.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, it is wise to maintain a moderate approach to avoid over-depletion of sheep while still allowing for some hunting to support wolf reproduction. This theta value reflects a balanced strategy that considers both current populations and the need for gradual adjustments.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 39.1% of maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.59, it is important to maintain a balanced approach to ensure both populations can thrive. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still supporting the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.13, which is only 29.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is some room for hunting, it is crucial to avoid overexploitation to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.18, which is only 22.0% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I also want to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will enable me to hunt more effectively while still being cautious about depleting the sheep further. This moderate adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.27, which is only 17.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from the previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35, I can still focus on competition with other wolves while allowing for some sustainable hunting. This balance will help maintain both populations over the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.11, which is only 14.6% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being mindful of the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.78, which is only 12.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the sustainability of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I need to ensure my pack can thrive, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta will enable me to hunt more effectively without depleting the sheep population too quickly, maintaining a balance that supports both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.13, which is only 10.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, promoting a sustainable balance between both populations."
