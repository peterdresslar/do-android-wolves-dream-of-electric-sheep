            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 71.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, the wolf population is also significant, and maintaining a balance is crucial. A slight reduction from my previous theta allows for sustainable hunting while still enabling the sheep population to recover and thrive. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments to ensure long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still below its maximum capacity, allowing for some increased hunting without risking depletion. However, with the wolf population nearing its current limits, a moderate approach will help maintain balance and ensure both populations can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.70, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual increase is necessary to ensure sustainability and avoid sudden population crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 24.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is some room for increased hunting without risking depletion. However, with a wolf population of 69, it's important to avoid overhunting to ensure our long-term survival. A moderate increase in theta allows for sustainable coexistence while still being cautious about the balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.30, which is only 19.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some reproduction among wolves while still giving sheep a chance to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without risking a rapid depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.62, which is only 16.0% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing competition with other wolves and allowing for some hunting without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.01, which is only 13.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is an opportunity to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction while still allowing for the sheep population to recover. A gradual increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, considering both the need for wolves to thrive and the importance of not depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.27, which is only 12.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from the previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35, I can still maintain some hunting activity while prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.02, which is only 10.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.20, which is only 10.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still competing with other wolves. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting without depleting the sheep population further, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.73, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and promotes long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.51, which is only 9.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting to support the wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta will help balance the needs of both species without risking a crash in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.40, which is only 9.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 reflects a balanced approach, promoting sustainability without risking a crash in the sheep population.",

This indicates a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover.
