By slightly increasing my theta from 0.400 to 0.35, I can maintain a focus on coexistence and sustainability without putting too much pressure on the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.65, which is only 9.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain its health. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help balance the need for hunting with the necessity of sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.58, which is only 9.6% of its maximum capacity. A lower theta allows for a focus on competing with other wolves, which will help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.70, which is only 9.7% of its maximum capacity.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.53, which is only 14.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is some room for increased hunting, we must be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 allows for a balanced approach to hunting while still considering the need for sustainable coexistence. This adjustment reflects a careful response to the current state of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.57, which is only 15.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is an opportunity to hunt, it is essential to maintain a balance to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.40 allows for some hunting while also focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.79, which is only 16.2% of its maximum capacity.
