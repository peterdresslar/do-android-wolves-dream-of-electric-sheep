However, with the wolf population at 73, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure our long-term survival. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, enabling us to maintain our numbers while still allowing the sheep population to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.13, which is only 29.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I can still hunt, I need to be cautious to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.40 allows for some hunting while also focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.18, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a significant competition among wolves. By slightly lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while still ensuring the wolf pack remains healthy. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.27, which is only 17.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is an opportunity to hunt, I need to be cautious and avoid overexploitation. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach, promoting sustainable coexistence while still enabling some hunting to support the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.11, which is only 14.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is some room for hunting, it is crucial to maintain a balance to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to support wolf reproduction.",

This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some recovery of the sheep while still ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.29, which is only 11.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate increase to 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population and maintaining a balance with the wolf population.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low at 10.47, which is only 9.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is a need for hunting to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population and maintaining a balance with the growing wolf numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.99, which is only 9.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is an opportunity to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A gradual increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.71, which is only 8.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, reducing hunting intensity slightly to promote sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.54, which is only 8.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is a need for cautious hunting to allow the sheep to recover. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.40, I can afford to increase my hunting intensity slightly to ensure the wolf population remains healthy without depleting the sheep too quickly. A moderate increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach that supports both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.58, which is only 8.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to allow the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own population of 21 wolves. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack without depleting the sheep further, promoting a more balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.73, which is only 8.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.35 to 0.40, I can maintain a balance between hunting and allowing the sheep population to stabilize, while also considering the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.99, which is only 9.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.4 to 0.35, I can still maintain some pressure on the sheep while focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.36, which is only 9.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.80, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting a lower theta, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize while avoiding overhunting. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.30, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",

This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.04, which is only 12.8% of its maximum capacity. While I want to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must prioritize the recovery of the sheep. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to stabilize and grow, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively low at 15.00, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we have a sustainable number of sheep for our current wolf population. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help us maintain our population while allowing the sheep to recover gradually. This approach aligns with the wisdom of making small adjustments to ensure a balanced ecosystem.",
