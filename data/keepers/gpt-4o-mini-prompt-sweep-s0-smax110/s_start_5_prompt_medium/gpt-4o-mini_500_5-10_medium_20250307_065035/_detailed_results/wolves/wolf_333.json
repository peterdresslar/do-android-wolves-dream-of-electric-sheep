            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, but the wolf population is slightly higher than optimal. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize our numbers while allowing the sheep to recover. This gradual adjustment will promote long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 47, which is only 42.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I need to maintain some hunting to support the wolf population, I should also focus on allowing the sheep to recover. A moderate increase from my previous theta of 0.25 to 0.35 reflects a balanced approach that considers both the current state of the sheep and the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.49, which is only 32.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I can increase my hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach that supports both populations without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.91, which is only 25.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep while still competing with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.11, which is only 20.1% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.35 helps maintain a balance and allows for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.08, which is only 16.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover while also considering the growing wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for hunting with the sustainability of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.79, which is only 14.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for wolves to thrive.",

This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.93, which is only 9.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.55, which is only 9.6% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure long-term sustainability, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting. This will help balance the ecosystem and prevent over-depletion of the sheep population.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.76, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.35, I can focus more on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be increased slightly to support wolf reproduction while still allowing for sheep recovery. A gradual increase from my previous theta will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep population too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.50, which is only 10.5% of its maximum capacity.
