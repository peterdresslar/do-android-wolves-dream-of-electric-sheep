            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that they can sustain some hunting pressure without immediate risk of depletion. However, given the current wolf population, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure our long-term survival. A slight reduction from my previous theta allows for continued hunting while still considering the balance needed for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at its maximum capacity, and while I need to maintain hunting to support wolf reproduction, I must also be cautious to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight reduction from my previous theta allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating a need to moderate hunting to prevent depletion. A balanced approach will allow for sustainable coexistence while still enabling the wolf population to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at its maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A lower theta will help balance the competition among wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that they can sustain a bit more hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for more hunting, which can help support the wolf population while still being cautious not to overhunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 92.7% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf reproduction and sheep sustainability, while avoiding overhunting that could lead to a crash in the sheep population. A gradual increase to 0.50 reflects a cautious approach to ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a moderate hunting approach that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This value reflects a cautious strategy, balancing the need to hunt with the importance of maintaining a sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 71.6% of its maximum capacity, which indicates a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with a wolf population of 56, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is relatively high at 1.41, suggesting that we should be cautious not to overhunt. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, allowing both populations to thrive without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 58.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population also being relatively high, a moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep too quickly. This gradual adjustment allows for both populations to thrive in the long term.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover gradually.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.26, which is only 24.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is a need for hunting to support wolf reproduction, it is also crucial to allow the sheep population to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.30, which is only 19.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.62, which is only 16.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population and maintaining a balance with the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.01, which is only 13.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for wolves to thrive."
