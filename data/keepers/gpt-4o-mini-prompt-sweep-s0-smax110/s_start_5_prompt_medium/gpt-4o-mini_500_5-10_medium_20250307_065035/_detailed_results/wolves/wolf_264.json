            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 70.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep. However, my previous theta was quite low at 0.228, which suggests a need to gradually increase hunting intensity to support the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 56.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population also being relatively high, a slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted to ensure the balance between both species is maintained without risking a rapid depletion of the sheep. This gradual adjustment allows for a more stable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, but the wolf population is relatively high. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while also preventing overcompetition among wolves. This moderate approach supports long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 36.95, which is only 33.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still being cautious about the sheep population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.75, which is only 26.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, reducing pressure on the sheep while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.64, which is only 21.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.38, which is only 17.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is some opportunity for hunting, I need to be cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population and maintaining a balance with the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low at 16.79, which is only 15.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be slightly increased to support wolf reproduction, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.68, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.4 to 0.35 allows for some hunting without over-depleting the sheep, promoting a more sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low at 12.2% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a balance as the wolf population is relatively high, and I want to ensure sustainable cycles while still allowing for some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.35, which is only 11.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 to 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for wolf survival while ensuring the sheep population can stabilize and grow.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.62, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting without risking depletion. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.35 to 0.40, I can help ensure the wolf population remains healthy while still allowing sheep to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.19, which is only 10.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can grow, promoting long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.98, which is only 10.0% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still being cautious. A gradual increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for some hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly. It also considers the current wolf population, which is relatively high, and aims to maintain a sustainable cycle.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.90, which is only 9.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to stabilize while still competing with other wolves. This moderate approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.07, which is only 10.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.27, which is only 10.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach that respects the current state of both populations, avoiding overexploitation of the sheep while still ensuring our pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.56, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. However, with the wolf population at 15.00, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A gradual increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach that supports both wolf reproduction and sheep recovery.",

This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly.
