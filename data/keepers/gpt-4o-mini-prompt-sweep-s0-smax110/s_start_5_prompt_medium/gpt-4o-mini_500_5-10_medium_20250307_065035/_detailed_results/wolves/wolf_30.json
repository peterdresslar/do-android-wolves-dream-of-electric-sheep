            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A lower theta will help maintain a balance, ensuring the long-term survival of both sheep and wolves while preventing overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain balance and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 3.67, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that they can sustain a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. However, with a wolf population of 34, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 92.7% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 40, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 92.30, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while maintaining a sustainable balance with the sheep population. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio, a moderate increase in theta will help ensure both populations can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 78.74, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are enough sheep to sustain a moderate hunting approach. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of my ancestors, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover gradually.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.70, a slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow for a more balanced approach, enabling both populations to thrive in the long term. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of making gradual changes in response to population dynamics.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 36.33, which is only 33.0% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A moderate increase from my previous theta of 0.400 helps maintain a balance as the wolf population is relatively high.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.26, which is only 24.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is some opportunity for hunting, it is crucial to maintain a balance to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.40 will help sustain both populations without depleting the sheep too quickly, while also allowing for some hunting to support the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.30, which is only 19.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to allow for recovery. A moderate increase to 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low at 17.62, which is only 16.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I can increase my hunting intensity slightly, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A small increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach that supports both the wolf population and the recovery of sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.01, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low at 0.28. This suggests that while I need to focus on hunting to support the wolf population, I must also be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while still giving sheep a chance to recover, aligning with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance."
