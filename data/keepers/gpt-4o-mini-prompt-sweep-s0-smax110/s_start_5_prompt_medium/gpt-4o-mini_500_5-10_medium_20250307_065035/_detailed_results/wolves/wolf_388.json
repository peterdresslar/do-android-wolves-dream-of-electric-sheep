            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 444\n- Sheep population: 9.71\n- Wolf population: 28.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.350\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.35 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 8.8% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 93.14, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. However, I must remain cautious as the wolf population is also significant at 50.00, and I want to avoid over-depleting the sheep. A theta of 0.85 strikes a balance between ensuring wolf reproduction and allowing the sheep population to sustain itself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for some increased hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help sustain our wolf population while still considering the need for balance as the sheep recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. While the sheep population is recovering, I need to ensure that the wolf population does not grow too quickly, which could lead to competition and depletion of resources. A theta of 0.60 allows for sustainable hunting while still considering the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that can support both wolf reproduction and sheep recovery. This balance will help prevent over-depletion of the sheep while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.13, which is only 29.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow for some recovery while still maintaining a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.18, which is only 22.0% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. A moderate increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach, ensuring both populations can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.27, which is only 17.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting a lower theta, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize while preventing overhunting. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.11, which is only 14.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.78, which is only 12.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need to compete with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to support wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach that can help maintain both populations sustainably.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.13, which is only 10.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking a rapid decline in the sheep population, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.47, which is only 9.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.99, which is only 9.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support our wolf population without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.71, which is only 8.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should be cautious with our hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf health while still being mindful of the sheep"
