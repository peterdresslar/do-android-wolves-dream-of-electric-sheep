            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and my previous theta was very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while also managing the competition among wolves. A gradual increase from my previous theta will help maintain balance without causing sudden population crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while ensuring that the sheep population has a chance to stabilize and grow, which is essential for long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. Maintaining the current theta allows for the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves, ensuring our long-term survival.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 94.91, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover if needed. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",

This adjustment will help maintain a balance as the wolf population grows, ensuring we do not deplete the sheep too quickly.",

The sheep population is currently at 58.5% of its maximum capacity, allowing for some sustainable hunting without risking depletion. This adjustment will help support the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the wolf population is relatively high. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling wolves to thrive. This approach maintains a balance and avoids depleting the sheep too quickly.",

This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery. A gradual increase is essential to avoid depleting the sheep population too quickly.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.72, which is only 20.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the immediate needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.24, which is only 16.6% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.40 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the sustainability of both populations.",

This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population.
