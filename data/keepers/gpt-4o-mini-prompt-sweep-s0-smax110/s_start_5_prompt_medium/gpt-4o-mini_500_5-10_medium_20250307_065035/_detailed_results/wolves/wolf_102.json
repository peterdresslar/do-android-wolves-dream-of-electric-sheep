            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 157\n- Sheep population: 13.62\n- Wolf population: 48.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.400\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.28 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 12.4% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution in hunting to allow for recovery. With a high sheep-to-wolf ratio and a growing wolf population, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must do so gradually to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that considers both current needs and long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 94.91, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 47.00, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 80.73, allowing for a moderate hunting approach. This value helps maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring both populations can thrive without depleting resources too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring the sheep can recover and thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, which is relatively high, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A theta of 0.4 allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery. A gradual increase aligns with the current trends and maintains balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.57, which is only 26.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to be cautious with our hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.40 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring both populations can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.72, which is only 20.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we can afford to increase our hunting intensity slightly to support our wolf population without risking a significant depletion of sheep. A moderate increase to 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still being mindful of the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.24, which is only 16.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a presence in the ecosystem. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring a sustainable balance as both populations adjust.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.68, which is only 14.3% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will enable me to hunt a bit more effectively while still prioritizing the balance needed for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.62, which is only 12.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability."
