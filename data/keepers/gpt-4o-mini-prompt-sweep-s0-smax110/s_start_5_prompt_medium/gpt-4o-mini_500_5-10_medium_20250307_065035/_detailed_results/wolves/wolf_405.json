            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 433\n- Sheep population: 58.21\n- Wolf population: 69.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.132\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.84 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 52.9% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 52.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without risking depletion. Given the current wolf population, a slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain our numbers while allowing the sheep to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term health of both populations. This moderate adjustment will help maintain balance as the sheep recover, while also considering the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 29.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 73, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to prevent a crash in the sheep population. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for more hunting while still prioritizing balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.18, which is only 22.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while also considering the need for sheep recovery and the current high wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.27, which is only 17.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.11, which is only 14.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it is important to maintain a cautious approach to allow the sheep population to recover. A moderate theta value of 0.35 reflects a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",

This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, reducing competition among wolves while still enabling some hunting.",

To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.47, which is only 9.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to be cautious with our hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 to 0.35 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term survival of both species. This adjustment also considers the current wolf population, which is relatively stable.",

To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain a balance and prevent overhunting, ensuring that we can sustain ourselves in the future.",

To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on a balanced approach that allows the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain itself. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will help me adapt to the current conditions without overexploiting the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.54, which is only 8.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderate to allow the sheep to recover while still providing enough food for the wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.58, which is only 8.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover.

To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.36, which is only 9.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to allow for some reproduction among wolves while still giving sheep a chance to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.80, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance and prevent over-depletion of the sheep, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.30, which is only 10.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for gradual adjustments.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.85, which is only 10.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover.
