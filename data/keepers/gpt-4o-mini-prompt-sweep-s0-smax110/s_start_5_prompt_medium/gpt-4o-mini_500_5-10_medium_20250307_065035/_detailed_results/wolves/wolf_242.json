            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. A lower theta allows for more competition among wolves, which can help control our numbers while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and maintain their numbers. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid overexploitation and to keep the ecosystem balanced.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 91.40, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sustainable coexistence. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, responding to the current conditions without risking a sudden depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without jeopardizing their recovery. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 56.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.95, a slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still ensuring the wolf population remains healthy.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 43.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 69, which is relatively high, I need to be cautious about over-hunting. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while still enabling the sheep to recover and ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery. A gradual increase aligns with the current trends and maintains balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.75, which is only 26.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I can increase hunting slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate increase to 0.45 allows for some hunting while still considering the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.64, which is only 21.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is some opportunity for hunting, it is crucial to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.38, which is only 17.6% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.35 helps maintain balance and allows for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.79, which is only 15.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for sustenance with the long-term health of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.68, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.39, which is only 12.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack without depleting the sheep further, promoting a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.35, which is only 11.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some sheep population recovery while still ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly."
