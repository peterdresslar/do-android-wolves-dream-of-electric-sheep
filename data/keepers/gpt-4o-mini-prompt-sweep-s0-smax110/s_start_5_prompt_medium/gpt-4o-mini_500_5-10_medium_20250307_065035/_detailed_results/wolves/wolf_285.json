            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. With a high sheep-to-wolf ratio and a growing wolf population, it is wise to focus on competition among wolves rather than intense hunting, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery. Maintaining a balance is crucial to ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, especially as the wolf population is relatively small. Gradual adjustments will help avoid depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery and prevent depletion. Maintaining a focus on competition with other wolves will help stabilize our population while ensuring the sheep can bounce back.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to depletion of their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition with other wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensifying hunting. This will allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a healthy balance in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and my previous theta was low. Increasing it slightly to 0.30 allows for a more balanced approach, enabling the sheep to recover while still allowing for some hunting to maintain the wolf population. This gradual adjustment helps avoid over-depletion of the sheep and supports long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery and avoid depleting their numbers. Maintaining a focus on competition with other wolves will help stabilize our population while ensuring the sheep can rebound.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers, jeopardizing the long-term survival of both species. Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition among wolves while giving the sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at its maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in sheep numbers, jeopardizing the long-term survival of both species. Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover and ensures a sustainable balance as the wolf population stabilizes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover and ensures the long-term survival of both species. It is essential to focus on competition with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and while I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta will enable me to hunt more effectively without risking a rapid depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that I can afford to increase my hunting intensity slightly while still allowing for sustainable coexistence. This moderate adjustment helps maintain a healthy wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 90.42, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly, considering the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need for gradual changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 70% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep to sustain hunting. However, with the wolf population also being significant, I need to ensure that I do not overhunt and deplete the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for more hunting while still maintaining a balance that supports both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for some hunting without risking depletion. With the wolf population also being relatively high, a slight reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and prevent overexploitation of the sheep. This approach supports sustainable coexistence while allowing for gradual adjustments as conditions change.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery. A gradual increase is prudent to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level relative to the maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both sheep and wolves while still maintaining a focus on competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.91, which is only 25.4% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A moderate increase to 0.45 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for sustainable coexistence as I monitor both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.11, which is only 20.1% of its maximum capacity. While I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, giving sheep a chance to recover while still enabling wolves to thrive."
