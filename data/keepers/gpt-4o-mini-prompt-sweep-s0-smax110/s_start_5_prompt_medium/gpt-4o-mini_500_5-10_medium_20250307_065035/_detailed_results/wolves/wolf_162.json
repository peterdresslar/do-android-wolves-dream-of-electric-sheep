With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 5.50, it is crucial to focus on competition among wolves to maintain a sustainable balance. This lower theta will help prevent overhunting and ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and while I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. With a high sheep-to-wolf ratio, focusing on competition with other wolves will help stabilize our population while giving sheep a chance to rebound.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and while I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta will enable some hunting while still prioritizing the balance and sustainability of both populations.",

To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover and prevent overexploitation. This lower theta will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem while allowing for future growth.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that we should be cautious with our hunting to avoid depleting their numbers. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that supports both the wolf population and the sheep",

This adjustment will help maintain balance as the sheep population is recovering, but I want to avoid overexploitation as the wolf population is also significant.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still considering the long-term balance of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 47.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.77, I need to be cautious about hunting intensity to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight reduction in hunting intensity allows for a more sustainable balance while still addressing the needs of the wolf population.",

This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach to hunting while still being cautious of the wolf population growth.",

This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover.
