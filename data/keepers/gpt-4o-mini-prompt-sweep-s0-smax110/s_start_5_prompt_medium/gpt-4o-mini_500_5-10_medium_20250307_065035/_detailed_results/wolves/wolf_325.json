            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 70% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with a low previous theta of 0.021, I need to gradually increase my hunting intensity to ensure the wolf population can sustain itself without depleting the sheep too quickly. A theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach that supports both populations while being cautious not to overhunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a balance as the sheep population is recovering, while also considering the growth of the wolf population. A gradual increase in theta supports sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery. A gradual increase aligns with the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and promotes long-term balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.49, which is only 32.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done gradually to avoid depleting the sheep further. A theta of 0.40 allows for a slight increase in hunting while still prioritizing the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.91, which is only 25.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack without depleting the sheep further, promoting a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.11, which is only 20.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is potential for recovery if I reduce hunting intensity slightly. By increasing theta to 0.40, I can maintain a balanced approach that allows for some hunting while also giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.08, which is only 16.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I can increase hunting intensity, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population, ensuring long-term sustainability for both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.79, which is only 14.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.91, which is only 12.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for more hunting intensity while still being cautious, as the wolf population is relatively high at 47. I aim to maintain a balance that supports both populations in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.46, which is only 11.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting a lower theta, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize while preventing overhunting. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.55, which is only 10.5% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will enable me to hunt more effectively while still prioritizing the long-term balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.93, which is only 9.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep population while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our own health. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for sustainable coexistence without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.55, which is only 9.6% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure my pack",

This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting a lower theta, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",

This indicates that there is potential for recovery if I reduce hunting intensity slightly. By increasing theta from 0.35 to 0.40, I can still maintain a focus on hunting while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow, ensuring a sustainable balance between both species."
