            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 442\n- Sheep population: 10.47\n- Wolf population: 36.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.350\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.29 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 9.5% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 93.8% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still ensuring their recovery. This adjustment balances the need for wolf reproduction with the sustainability of the sheep population, avoiding drastic changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while still ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 70.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, since the wolf population is also significant, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight reduction from my previous theta allows for continued hunting while also considering the need for balance as wolf numbers grow.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 52.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to prevent a crash in the sheep population. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 39.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without risking depletion. Given the current wolf population, a slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance as we adapt to the growing wolf numbers while still allowing the sheep population to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level relative to the maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are not enough sheep to sustain aggressive hunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious to avoid depleting the sheep population further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.18, which is only 22.0% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, allowing for sustainable coexistence while still addressing the needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.27, which is only 17.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition among wolves, ensuring both populations can recover sustainably.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.11, which is only 14.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for more hunting intensity while still considering the long-term health of both populations. It reflects a cautious approach to ensure that both wolves and sheep can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.78, which is only 12.5% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity slightly. This will allow the sheep population to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.29, which is only 11.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.13, which is only 10.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it is essential to do so gradually to avoid depleting the sheep population further. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low at 10.47, which is only 9.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still being mindful of the need to compete with other wolves."
