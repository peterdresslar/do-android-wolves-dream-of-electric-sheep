            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. A moderate theta value will help balance the competition among wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring the long-term survival of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover and prevent overexploitation. This lower theta will help maintain a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderate to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 93% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover if needed. A gradual increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, avoiding sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 91.40, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we have enough prey to sustain our hunting without over-depleting the sheep. A slight reduction from my previous theta allows for a more balanced approach, ensuring that both populations can thrive while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help sustain our wolf population while still allowing sheep to recover and thrive. It reflects a balanced approach, responding to the current conditions and trends.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 36.95, which is only 33.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I can still hunt, I should focus on a more balanced approach to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.40 allows for some hunting while also considering the need to compete with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.75, which is only 26.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate approach will allow for some hunting while also giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.64, which is only 21.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.38, which is only 17.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from the previous theta of 0.40 to 0.35, I can still maintain some hunting while prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep. This moderate adjustment will help ensure sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.79, which is only 15.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support our reproduction without over-depleting the sheep. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need to adapt to the changing conditions of both populations.",

While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the balance and sustainability of both populations."
