            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 92.30, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports our reproductive needs while ensuring that the sheep population remains sustainable. A theta of 0.68 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for coexistence as we monitor both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 71.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.41, it is essential to maintain a balance that allows for sustainable coexistence. A moderate theta of 0.60 allows for continued hunting to support wolf reproduction while ensuring that the sheep population can recover and thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still promoting sustainable coexistence. This adjustment reflects the need to balance the growing wolf population with the available sheep, ensuring that both can thrive without depleting resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.1% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This balance will help sustain both the sheep and wolf populations while allowing for gradual adjustments as conditions change.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low relative to the maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. A moderate hunting intensity will allow for some sheep recovery while still enabling wolves to sustain their numbers. This approach supports long-term coexistence and avoids depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.26, which is only 24.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.40 allows for some hunting while still focusing on the competition with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.30, which is only 19.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, ensuring that we do not deplete the sheep further while still competing effectively with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.62, which is only 16.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I can increase my hunting intensity slightly to take advantage of the available prey, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A theta of 0.40 allows for a moderate increase in hunting while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.01, which is only 13.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still enabling some hunting to support wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.27, which is only 12.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.02, which is only 10.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack without depleting the sheep further. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.20, which is only 10.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable, and focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both populations by preventing overhunting and allowing for a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.73, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should be cautious with our hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still acknowledging the need for some hunting to support our wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.51, which is only 9.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while allowing the sheep population to gradually increase."
