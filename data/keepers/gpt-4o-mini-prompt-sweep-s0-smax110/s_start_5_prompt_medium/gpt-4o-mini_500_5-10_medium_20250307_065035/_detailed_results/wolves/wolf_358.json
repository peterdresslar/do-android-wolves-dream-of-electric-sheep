A slight increase to 0.25 allows for a gradual increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the recovery of sheep and avoiding overexploitation. This approach helps maintain a balance between wolf competition and sustainable sheep hunting.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to recover, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and while I need to ensure the survival of my pack, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance while avoiding overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at its maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. With a high sheep-to-wolf ratio, focusing on competition with other wolves will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in sheep numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover while keeping competition among wolves in check, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",

Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both populations.",

A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance while still allowing for some hunting to support the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 93.8% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, I must remain cautious as the wolf population is also significant. A gradual increase to 0.40 allows for sustainable hunting while ensuring that both populations can thrive.",

However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.32, it is essential to maintain a balance that allows for both wolf reproduction and sheep recovery. A moderate increase in hunting intensity to 0.55 will support the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to thrive.",

With the sheep population at 52.9% of its maximum capacity, I can maintain a sustainable coexistence while ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. This slight reduction from my previous theta allows for gradual adjustments in response to both sheep and wolf population trends.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting approach. This will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations while avoiding overhunting. Gradually adjusting my hunting intensity will support both the long-term survival of wolves and the recovery of sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.13, which is only 29.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is some room for hunting, I need to be cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still enabling some hunting to support reproduction.",

This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach that considers both the current low sheep numbers and the need to avoid over-depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.27, which is only 17.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from the previous theta of 0.450 to 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves and ensure sustainable coexistence.",
