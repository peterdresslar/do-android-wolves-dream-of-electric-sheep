            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. While the sheep population is recovering, I want to ensure that we do not over-deplete their numbers. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for sustainable hunting while still considering the growth of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 39.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.59, a moderate approach allows for a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves. This adjustment will help maintain both populations over the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 29.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.44, it is essential to maintain a balance that allows both populations to thrive. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help the sheep recover while still allowing for some hunting to support the wolf population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of making gradual adjustments to ensure long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.18, which is only 22.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is some opportunity for hunting, it is crucial to avoid overexploitation to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still enabling some hunting to support our population without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.27, which is only 17.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.11, which is only 14.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for sustenance with the long-term health of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.78, which is only 12.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting without risking the depletion of the sheep. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.29, which is only 11.2% of its maximum capacity.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.47, which is only 9.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 to 0.35 reflects a focus on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, promoting a sustainable balance.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.99, which is only 9.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both populations. It also reflects a cautious approach as the wolf population is relatively high at 17.00, necessitating a balance to prevent over-depletion of sheep.",
