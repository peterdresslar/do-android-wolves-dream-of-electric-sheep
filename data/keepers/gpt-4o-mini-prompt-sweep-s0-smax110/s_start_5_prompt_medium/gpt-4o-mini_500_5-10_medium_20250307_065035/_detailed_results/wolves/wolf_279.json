            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is high. This indicates that while there are many sheep available, my focus should be on competing with other wolves to ensure our population remains stable. A gradual increase in theta will allow for some hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly, maintaining a balance for future sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively low. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both species.",
