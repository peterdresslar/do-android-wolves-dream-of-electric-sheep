            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 93.14, allowing for some increased hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction. However, I must be cautious not to overhunt, as the sheep are at 84.7% of their maximum capacity. A moderate increase to 0.75 allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling growth in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while still enabling the sheep to recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 52.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure our long-term survival. A slight reduction from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 39.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 73, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.13, which is only 29.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight reduction from my previous theta allows for a more balanced approach, focusing on maintaining the sheep population while still ensuring the wolf pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.18, which is only 22.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for moderate hunting without risking depletion. At the same time, the wolf population is relatively high at 70.00, so I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to maintain a balance. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a more sustainable approach while still considering the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.27, which is only 17.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack without depleting the sheep further, promoting a healthier balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.11, which is only 14.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.78, which is only 12.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population. This gradual adjustment helps ensure long-term sustainability for both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.29, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help support the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual increase is necessary to maintain balance and avoid sudden crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.13, which is only 10.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.47, which is only 9.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some recovery of the sheep population while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without risking a rapid depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.99, which is only 9.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 will help balance our need for hunting with the necessity of not depleting the sheep further, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.71, which is only 8.8% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, a slight increase in hunting intensity to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach that can help sustain both populations. This adjustment is gradual, responding to the current state of the ecosystem without risking a sudden depletion of sheep."
