            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 368\n- Sheep population: 13.91\n- Wolf population: 47.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.350\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.30 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 12.6% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition with other wolves. A gradual adjustment will help maintain balance without causing sudden population crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is very close to its maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 3.43, it is wise to focus on competition with other wolves to ensure our population remains stable while allowing the sheep to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that I can afford to increase my hunting intensity slightly without risking a rapid depletion of the sheep. A moderate increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, ensuring the wolf population can sustain itself while still allowing the sheep to recover if needed. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still healthy at 101.27, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly, as we are still below the maximum capacity. A gradual increase aligns with the wisdom of adapting to population trends.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 90.42, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to maintain balance, considering the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 70% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with the wolf population also being relatively high, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for sustainable hunting while still considering the long-term balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, and while it is beneficial to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must also consider the growing wolf population. A theta of 0.40 allows for a balanced approach that supports both species without risking over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This will help support wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery. A gradual adjustment is key to maintaining balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep. This moderate adjustment will help maintain our wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderate to allow for recovery while still supporting wolf reproduction. A slight increase from my previous theta will help balance the needs of both populations without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.11, which is only 20.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance, reducing hunting intensity slightly to support sheep recovery while still allowing for some hunting to sustain our pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.08, which is only 16.4% of its maximum capacity. While I need to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must do so gradually to avoid depleting the sheep population further. A slight increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach that considers both the current state of the sheep and the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.79, which is only 14.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should prioritize allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting approach. A theta of 0.35 reflects a slight increase in hunting intensity compared to my previous value, acknowledging the need to balance our population dynamics without overexploiting the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.91, which is only 12.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to allow the sheep to recover while still ensuring our wolf population remains healthy. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support reproduction, but it is still cautious enough to avoid depleting the sheep further."
