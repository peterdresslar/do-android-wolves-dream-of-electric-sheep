            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 88\n- Sheep population: 13.27\n- Wolf population: 47.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.350\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.28 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 12.1% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensifying hunting. This will allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. A gradual increase from my previous theta will help balance the competition with other wolves while still considering the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we compete with other wolves. This approach helps maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently healthy and close to its maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual adjustment is necessary to avoid over-depletion of the sheep and ensure long-term balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 92.30, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and maintain a healthy balance in the ecosystem. A gradual increase aligns with the wisdom of adapting to population trends without causing sudden disruptions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while I want to ensure the wolves can thrive, I also need to be cautious not to deplete the sheep too quickly. A slight reduction from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, enabling both populations to stabilize and coexist.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term survival for both.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 69, it",
            "I chose this theta because it represents a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balanced approach. The sheep population is currently low at 36.33, which allows for some increased hunting without risking depletion. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while keeping the sheep population sustainable.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.26, which is only 24.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.40 allows for some hunting while still focusing on the competition with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.30, which is only 19.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to allow the sheep population to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I need to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.01, which is only 13.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for sustenance with the goal of long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.27, which is only 12.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some replenishment of the sheep while still focusing on maintaining a healthy wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting sustainability without risking a crash in either population."
