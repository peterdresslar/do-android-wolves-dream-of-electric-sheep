            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 161\n- Sheep population: 10.43\n- Wolf population: 29.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.400\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.36 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 9.5% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 94.91, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep do not deplete too quickly. A gradual adjustment is key to maintaining balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the sheep population at 73.4% of maximum capacity, I can maintain a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This gradual adjustment helps avoid depleting the sheep too quickly and allows for a healthier ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is crucial to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly and to promote a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. Given the current wolf population of 69, a moderate approach will help maintain balance and allow for gradual adjustments as conditions change.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and while it is important to maintain a balance, I need to focus on the competition with other wolves to ensure our pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 26.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69.00, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both populations can thrive. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for more hunting while still maintaining a balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.72, which is only 20.7% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, allowing for sustainable coexistence while still addressing the needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.24, which is only 16.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.400 to 0.35, I can maintain a focus on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring the sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.68, which is only 14.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more moderate approach to hunting is necessary to allow the sheep to recover while still ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a gradual adjustment in hunting intensity without risking a sudden decline in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.62, which is only 12.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our own population. A slight increase from my previous theta will help balance our needs without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low at 12.23, which is only 11.1% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will enable me to hunt more effectively while still prioritizing the long-term balance of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.26, which is only 10.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover while also considering the growing wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.4 to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I need to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.43, which is only 9.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to stabilize while still competing with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem."
