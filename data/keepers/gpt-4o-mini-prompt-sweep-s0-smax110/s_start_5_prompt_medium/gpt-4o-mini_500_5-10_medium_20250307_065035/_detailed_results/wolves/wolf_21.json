            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition with other wolves. A lower theta will help maintain balance without risking a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at its maximum capacity, indicating that we should be cautious with our hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the balance between our populations.",

However, given the relatively high wolf population, I must also be mindful of competition among wolves. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting sustainable coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",

With a high sheep-to-wolf ratio, focusing on competition with other wolves will help stabilize our population while giving the sheep a chance to rebound.",

A moderate increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still giving sheep a chance to recover if needed. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",

This adjustment will help maintain a balance as the wolf population grows, ensuring we do not deplete the sheep too quickly.",

This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance and avoid overexploitation.",

A moderate theta allows for some hunting while also considering the need for sheep recovery and maintaining a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.30, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking over-depletion. This adjustment will help sustain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A moderate increase from my previous theta of 0.400 reflects a cautious approach to balance hunting and competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.62, which is only 16.0% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population.
