However, my previous theta was very low, and I need to gradually increase my hunting intensity to ensure the wolf population can thrive without depleting the sheep too quickly. A theta of 0.25 allows for a cautious increase in hunting while still prioritizing the balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 56.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population slightly higher than the sheep population, a moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep too quickly. This adjustment allows for gradual adaptation to the current conditions while ensuring both populations can thrive.",

This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while being mindful of our own population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our needs without depleting the sheep further, promoting a more balanced ecosystem.",
