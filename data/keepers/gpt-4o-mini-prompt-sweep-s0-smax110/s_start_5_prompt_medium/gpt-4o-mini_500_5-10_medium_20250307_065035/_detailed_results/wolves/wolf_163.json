            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 5:1, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A lower theta will help reduce competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to stabilize, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. With a high sheep-to-wolf ratio and a growing wolf population, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 3.67, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that we should be cautious about hunting intensity to avoid depleting their numbers too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that supports both wolf reproduction and sheep recovery, while still being mindful of the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 94.7% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 39, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 93.94, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction. However, I must remain cautious and avoid overhunting, as the sheep are not at maximum capacity and the wolf population is growing. A moderate increase will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity gradually, I must also consider the growing wolf population. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and allow both populations to thrive without depleting resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover and maintain balance. It",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for some hunting without risking depletion. With the wolf population also being relatively high, a slight reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and ensure the long-term survival of both species. This adjustment allows for sustainable coexistence while still addressing immediate needs.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment reflects a balance between ensuring the wolf population remains healthy while allowing the sheep to recover and thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 30.82, which is only 28.0% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure my pack's survival through hunting, I must also allow the sheep population to recover. A moderate theta of 0.40 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.90, which is only 21.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing our own population. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, ensuring both sheep and wolves can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.44, which is only 17.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that I can afford to increase my hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A gradual increase to 0.40 strikes a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.66, which is only 15.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to stabilize while still competing with other wolves. This moderate approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a balance for long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.58, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A moderate increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for sustainable coexistence."
