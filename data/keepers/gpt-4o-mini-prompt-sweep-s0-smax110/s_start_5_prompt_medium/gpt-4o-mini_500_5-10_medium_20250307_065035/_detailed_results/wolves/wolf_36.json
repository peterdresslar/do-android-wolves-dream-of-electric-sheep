A lower theta will help balance competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to stabilize, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual increase aligns with the wisdom of adapting to changing conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 101.92, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. It reflects a cautious approach to ensure sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This approach helps maintain a sustainable balance between both populations, considering the current trends and avoiding drastic changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will support wolf reproduction without overly depleting the sheep population, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 58.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population being nearly equal to the sheep population, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment reflects a balance between ensuring the wolf population remains healthy and allowing the sheep to recover. Gradually increasing theta helps maintain a dynamic equilibrium in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 33.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 70, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.26, which is only 24.8% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A moderate adjustment helps maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep can recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.30, which is only 19.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is some opportunity for hunting, it is crucial to avoid overexploitation. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach supports the long-term survival of both species and helps maintain a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.62, which is only 16.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should be cautious with our hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support our wolf population while still prioritizing the sustainability of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.01, which is only 13.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for the sheep to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I am focusing on competition with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and gradually increase. This approach aligns with the wisdom of making small adjustments to maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.27, which is only 12.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for wolves to thrive."
