            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 436\n- Sheep population: 24.18\n- Wolf population: 70.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.450\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.35 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 22.0% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery. Maintaining a lower theta will help prevent overexploitation of the sheep while we focus on competing with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",

Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to recover, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",

Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover and prevents overexploitation, ensuring long-term survival for both species. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments to maintain balance in the ecosystem.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at its maximum capacity, and maintaining a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover and prevent overexploitation. This approach also helps to stabilize the wolf population as we focus on competition with other wolves rather than aggressive hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution in hunting to prevent depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, promoting a sustainable balance.",

Maintaining a lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, preventing overhunting and allowing for a sustainable balance.",

A lower theta allows the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance without risking a crash in either population.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity to ensure the wolf population thrives, I must do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some growth in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 93.8% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 42, it",

This will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for some hunting without risking depletion. Given that the wolf population is also relatively high, a slight reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and allow both populations to thrive. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of making gradual changes to ensure sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.59, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level relative to the maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity can be increased slightly without risking depletion. However, given the current wolf population, a moderate increase allows for sustainable coexistence while still considering the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.18, which is only 22.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I can increase my hunting intensity slightly, I should still prioritize a balanced approach to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.40 reflects a cautious increase in hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both populations."
