            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 440\n- Sheep population: 12.29\n- Wolf population: 46.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.300\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.27 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 11.2% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at its maximum capacity, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a potential overhunting risk. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing the competition among wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and while I want to increase hunting to support wolf reproduction, I must do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that considers both the current sheep population and the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high at 93.8% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, given the current wolf population and the need to maintain balance, a moderate increase to 0.40 will help ensure sustainable coexistence while allowing for some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 93.14, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 50, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual increase is necessary to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly and to maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicating a slight competition for resources, a moderate theta will help maintain the sheep population while ensuring the wolf pack remains healthy. This adjustment allows for sustainable coexistence and prepares for future fluctuations in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term survival of both species. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to ensure that we do not over-deplete the sheep, especially as the wolf population is relatively high.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 29.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach to hunting while still being cautious of the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.18, which is only 22.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also considering the growing wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.27, which is only 17.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the immediate needs of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.11, which is only 14.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population and maintaining a balance with the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.78, which is only 12.5% of its maximum capacity. Given the high wolf population of 52, it is prudent to focus on competition with other wolves rather than intensifying hunting. This will allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a healthy balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.29, which is only 11.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting without risking the sheep"
