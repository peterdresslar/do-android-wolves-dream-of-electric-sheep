            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 150\n- Sheep population: 64.36\n- Wolf population: 64.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.768\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 1.01 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 58.5% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

This will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid over-depletion of the sheep, ensuring a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, which is relatively high, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A moderate theta of 0.55 allows for a balanced approach that supports both sheep recovery and wolf population stability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while preventing over-depletion of the sheep. This adjustment reflects a balanced approach, considering the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need to maintain both populations in harmony.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.72, which is only 20.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we can afford to increase our hunting intensity slightly to support our wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.24, which is only 16.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.68, which is only 14.3% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a bit more hunting while still prioritizing sustainability and avoiding over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.62, which is only 12.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach that balances our need for sustenance with the long-term health of both species.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. A moderate approach will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can stabilize, which is crucial for the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.74, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain a balance and prevent overhunting, ensuring sustainable cycles.",

While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will enable me to maintain some hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between both populations.",

This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance and promote the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.37, which is only 9.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is a need to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a slight increase in hunting intensity to support the wolf population. A gradual increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.56, which is only 9.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from my previous theta of 0.40 to 0.35, I can still maintain some hunting activity while prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both populations. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.93, which is only 9.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased slightly to support wolf reproduction, it is crucial to avoid overhunting to allow the sheep population to recover. A small increase to 0.40 reflects a cautious approach to balance hunting and competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.35, which is only 10.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and support the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.85, which is only 10.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is potential for growth in the sheep population if I reduce hunting intensity slightly. By increasing theta to 0.40, I can maintain a balanced approach that allows for some hunting while also giving the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
