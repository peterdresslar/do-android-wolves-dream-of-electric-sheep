            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. However, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, so a balanced approach is necessary to ensure sustainable coexistence and prevent over-depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, and while it is beneficial to hunt for reproduction, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while still enabling us to maintain a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to adopt a balanced approach that allows for some hunting while also considering the need for sheep recovery. This theta value reflects a gradual adjustment to maintain sustainability without risking over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while still keeping the wolf population stable. This approach aligns with the wisdom of making gradual adjustments to maintain a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while still enabling wolves to compete effectively. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
