However, given the current wolf population of 10, I need to be cautious not to overhunt and deplete the sheep too quickly. A slight reduction from my previous theta allows for continued hunting while also considering the need for balance as wolf numbers grow.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sustainable coexistence. It reflects a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can recover.",

Maintaining a theta of 0.60 supports sustainable coexistence while still enabling some hunting to ensure the wolf population remains healthy. This gradual adjustment helps avoid depleting the sheep too quickly while allowing for the potential growth of the wolf pack.",
