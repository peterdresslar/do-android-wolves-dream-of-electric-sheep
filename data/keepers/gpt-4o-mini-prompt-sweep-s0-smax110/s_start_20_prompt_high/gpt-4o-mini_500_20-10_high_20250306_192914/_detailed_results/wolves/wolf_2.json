            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining our pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, but the wolf population is low, indicating a need for cautious hunting to allow for growth while avoiding over-depletion of sheep. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the balance and sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a sustainable wolf population. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, indicating a need for cautious hunting to prevent over-depletion. However, with a relatively low wolf population, a slight increase in hunting intensity will help support our growth while still allowing the sheep to recover. This moderate adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance."
