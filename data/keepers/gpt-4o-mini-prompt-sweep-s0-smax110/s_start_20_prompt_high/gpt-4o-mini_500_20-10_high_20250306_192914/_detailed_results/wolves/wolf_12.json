However, with a low wolf population of 8, it is wise to focus on competition with other wolves to ensure our numbers can increase. A theta of 0.25 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the recovery of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 57.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, the wolf population is relatively low at 9.00, suggesting that I should focus on gradual growth rather than intense hunting. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still enabling the sheep population to recover and maintain balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 59.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for more hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep. This adjustment reflects the need to respond to the current conditions without risking a rapid depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful at 67.74, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A balanced approach at this stage supports sustainable coexistence, which is crucial for the long-term survival of both species.",

This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still maintaining a sustainable balance with the sheep population, which is currently at 63.5% of its maximum capacity. A moderate increase to 0.60 reflects a cautious approach to ensure both populations can thrive.",

This value balances the need to sustain our wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. It reflects a cautious approach to avoid over-depletion of sheep while still allowing for some growth in our numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful at 68.69, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population while still ensuring that the sheep can recover over time. A moderate increase to 0.60 reflects a balanced approach, aligning with the current ecosystem state and promoting coexistence.",

A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while still enabling us to compete effectively with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
