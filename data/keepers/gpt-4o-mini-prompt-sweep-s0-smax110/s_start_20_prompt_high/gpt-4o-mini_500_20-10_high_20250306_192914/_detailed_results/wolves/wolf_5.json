With a relatively low wolf population and a high sheep-to-wolf ratio, I can intensify my hunting slightly to promote wolf reproduction while still allowing for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for increased hunting intensity without risking depletion. With a low wolf population and a high sheep-to-wolf ratio, I can afford to hunt more aggressively to support wolf reproduction while still maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for some increased hunting intensity without risking depletion. With the wolf population being relatively low, a moderate increase in hunting will help us grow while still allowing the sheep to recover and maintain balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 57.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population being relatively low, I want to ensure that we do not over-deplete the sheep, allowing for a gradual increase in hunting intensity while still focusing on the long-term balance between both populations.",
