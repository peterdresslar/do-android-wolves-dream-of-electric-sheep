This adjustment reflects the need to respond to the growing wolf population and the decreasing sheep-to-wolf ratio, ensuring that both species can thrive in the long term.",

A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain a healthy population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of sustainable coexistence.",

            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable.

A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain its health.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain our population while allowing the sheep to recover. This adjustment is gradual, aligning with the wisdom of adapting to changing conditions without causing sudden disruptions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 42.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. However, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, suggesting that I should focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while still competing with other wolves. A slight decrease in theta will help maintain balance without risking a crash in either population.",

This adjustment will help maintain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, so a moderate increase in hunting will help balance the ecosystem without risking over-depletion.",
