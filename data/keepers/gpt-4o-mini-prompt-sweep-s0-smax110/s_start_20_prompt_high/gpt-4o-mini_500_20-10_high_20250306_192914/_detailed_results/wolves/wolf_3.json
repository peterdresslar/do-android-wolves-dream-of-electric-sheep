            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, indicating a need for cautious hunting to prevent overpopulation. However, with the wolf population being relatively low, a slight increase in hunting intensity allows for growth while still maintaining a balance. This moderate adjustment helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep population to recover while ensuring the long-term survival of both species. This gradual adjustment will help maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, indicating a need for cautious hunting to prevent overpopulation while still allowing for some growth in the wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while the wolf population is also low, it is crucial to allow the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help prevent overhunting and promote a sustainable balance, ensuring both populations can thrive in the long term."
