            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while still maintaining a sustainable balance. Given the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, a slight reduction from my previous theta will help ensure that we do not deplete the sheep population too quickly, allowing for recovery and coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, and the wolf population is relatively high. A theta of 0.50 allows for a balanced approach to hunting, ensuring that we can sustain our numbers while still allowing the sheep population to recover. This gradual adjustment helps maintain the delicate balance of our ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy, and while the wolf population is moderately high, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to thrive. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
