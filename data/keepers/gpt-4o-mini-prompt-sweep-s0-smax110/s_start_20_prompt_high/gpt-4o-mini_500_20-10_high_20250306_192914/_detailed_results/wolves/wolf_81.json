This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",

This adjustment reflects the need to adapt to the decreasing sheep-to-wolf ratio, ensuring that both populations can thrive without leading to overexploitation of the sheep.",

However, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, suggesting that I should be cautious and not increase hunting intensity too aggressively. A slight increase to 0.450 allows for continued hunting while still considering the long-term balance of both populations.",

This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a balance and adapting gradually to changing conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that we need to focus more on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting.

This moderate approach helps maintain a balance in the ecosystem without risking over-depletion of the sheep.",
