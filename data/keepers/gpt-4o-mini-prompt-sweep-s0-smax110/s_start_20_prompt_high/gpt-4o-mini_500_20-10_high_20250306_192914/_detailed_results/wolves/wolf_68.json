            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 345\n- Sheep population: 57.61\n- Wolf population: 24.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.636\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 2.40 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 52.4% of maximum capacity\n\nEcosystem observations:\n- The ratio of sheep to wolves is becoming less favorable, which may require adaptation.\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, and while the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, a balanced approach will allow for sustainable coexistence. This adjustment will help maintain the wolf population while still allowing for some hunting of sheep to support reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 51.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, suggesting that I should be cautious and avoid overhunting. A moderate theta allows for continued hunting while also considering the need to maintain a healthy balance between wolf and sheep populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. The wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, so a small adjustment towards more competition with other wolves is prudent to ensure sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while still enabling wolves to maintain their numbers. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while still maintaining enough pressure to support wolf reproduction. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of sustainable coexistence.",
