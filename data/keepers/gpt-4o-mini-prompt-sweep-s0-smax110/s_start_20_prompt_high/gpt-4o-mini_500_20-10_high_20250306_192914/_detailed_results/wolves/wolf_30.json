            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 60.63, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. However, the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A theta of 0.65 strikes a balance between hunting to support our population while allowing the sheep to recover and maintain a sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the wolf population being moderately high and the sheep-to-wolf ratio becoming less favorable, a slight reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain a sustainable balance while still allowing for some reproduction among wolves. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of making gradual changes rather than drastic shifts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, and the wolf population is also relatively high. A theta of 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, enabling some hunting to support wolf reproduction while also giving sheep a chance to recover. This adjustment is gradual and considers the current sheep-to-wolf ratio, which is becoming less favorable.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while still enabling wolves to maintain their numbers. This approach aligns with the wisdom of making gradual adjustments to ensure long-term sustainability.",
