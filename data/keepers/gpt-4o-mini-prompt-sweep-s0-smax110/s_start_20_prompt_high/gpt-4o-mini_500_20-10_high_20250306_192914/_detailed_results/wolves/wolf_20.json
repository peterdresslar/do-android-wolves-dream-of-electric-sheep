            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful at 69.83, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual increase to 0.52 reflects a balanced approach, responding to the current conditions without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A moderate increase from my previous theta reflects the need to adapt to the current conditions without risking over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful at 68.69, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain our wolf population while still ensuring that the sheep can recover over time. A moderate increase to 0.60 strikes a balance between competing with other wolves and maintaining a healthy sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. However, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating a need to slightly reduce hunting intensity to ensure sustainable coexistence and allow for the wolf population to stabilize.",

            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while still enabling us to maintain a healthy wolf population. This approach supports sustainable coexistence without risking a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A lower theta will allow for more competition among wolves, which can help stabilize our numbers while giving the sheep population a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
