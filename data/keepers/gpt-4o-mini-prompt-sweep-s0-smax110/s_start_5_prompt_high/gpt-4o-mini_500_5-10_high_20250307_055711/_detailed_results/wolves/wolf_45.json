            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 55\n- Sheep population: 25.18\n- Wolf population: 28.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.300\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.90 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 22.9% of maximum capacity\n\nEcosystem observations:\n- The wolf population is moderately high.\n- Sheep numbers are becoming concerning, suggesting caution may be needed.\n- The ratio of sheep to wolves is becoming less favorable, which may require adaptation.\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still reasonably plentiful, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population being high, it's important to avoid overhunting to prevent depletion of the sheep and ensure sustainable coexistence. A gradual adjustment towards a more balanced approach will help maintain both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, and while the wolf population is high, a moderate hunting intensity will help maintain balance. This allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves. A gradual approach is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that increased competition among wolves is likely. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, enabling some hunting to support wolf reproduction while also giving sheep a chance to recover. This adjustment is necessary to maintain a sustainable ecosystem without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A moderate approach allows for some hunting while also reducing competition among wolves, helping to stabilize both populations. This gradual adjustment will support the long-term health of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition among wolves. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. This lower theta value will help maintain balance and ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while reducing pressure on their population, ensuring a more sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling wolves to maintain their numbers. This approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence.",

A lower theta allows for a focus on reducing competition and giving the sheep a chance to recover, which is essential for long-term balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we manage our numbers more sustainably. This cautious approach aligns with the need to maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
