            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a balance as the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A gradual increase will support our needs while still allowing the sheep to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while still maintaining enough pressure to support wolf reproduction. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of adapting to changing conditions without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, and the wolf population is also relatively high. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain the balance, allowing for sustainable coexistence while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep too quickly. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of adapting to changing conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while still enabling wolves to compete effectively. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can allow the sheep population to recover while ensuring the long-term survival of both species. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, and the wolf population is relatively high. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach to hunting, which can help sustain both populations without depleting the sheep too quickly. This adjustment reflects the need to adapt to the changing sheep-to-wolf ratio while still being cautious not to overhunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the wolf population is moderately high. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain our population while allowing the sheep to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the need for balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that while the sheep population is still relatively healthy, the wolf population is moderately high. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to compete effectively. This approach aligns with the wisdom of making gradual adjustments to maintain balance.",
