This allows for a more aggressive hunting strategy, which can help increase our wolf population through successful reproduction. However, I will keep it slightly below 1.0 to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly and ensure a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is abundant and at 90.4% of its maximum capacity, allowing for more aggressive hunting without risking immediate depletion. However, since the wolf population is moderately high, I want to avoid overhunting and ensure a sustainable balance. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for continued hunting while also considering the long-term health of both populations.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. However, the wolf population is high, which necessitates a cautious approach to avoid over-depleting the sheep. This theta reflects a balanced strategy that promotes coexistence while still allowing for some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the wolf population being relatively high, it",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that we need to reduce hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. A moderate theta value will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, and a lower theta will allow the sheep population to recover while we manage our numbers. This gradual adjustment helps ensure long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is concerningly low, and with a high wolf population, competition is likely to increase. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This gradual adjustment will help ensure a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
