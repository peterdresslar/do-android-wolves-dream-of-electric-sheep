This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still maintaining a sustainable balance with the sheep population, as they are currently at 65.1% of their maximum capacity. A gradual increase in theta will help avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful at 71.21, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. Maintaining a theta of 0.60 supports sustainable coexistence while still enabling some hunting to ensure the wolf population remains healthy. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of responding to population trends without causing sudden shifts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a sustainable balance. This adjustment reflects the need to support the wolf population without over-depleting the sheep, ensuring long-term coexistence.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 58.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain balance while allowing the sheep population to recover and ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure sustainable coexistence, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity slightly to allow the sheep to recover while still keeping an eye on the wolf population dynamics. This gradual adjustment will help maintain balance without risking a crash.",

However, the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain its health. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
