            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently abundant at maximum capacity, allowing for a more aggressive hunting strategy. This will help ensure the wolf population can thrive while still being mindful of the need for sustainable practices. A slight increase from my previous theta will help balance the immediate need for food with the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is abundant and close to its maximum capacity, allowing for more aggressive hunting without immediate risk of depletion. This increase in hunting intensity can help sustain our wolf population by ensuring we have enough resources for reproduction. However, I will still keep it below 1.0 to avoid overexploitation and maintain a balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently abundant at 99.39, which allows for a more aggressive hunting strategy without risking immediate depletion. With the wolf population being moderately high, increasing my hunting intensity slightly will help ensure the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. However, the wolf population is high, which necessitates a cautious approach to avoid over-depletion of sheep. This theta strikes a balance between maintaining our population and ensuring the sheep can recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, allowing for some increased hunting intensity without risking depletion. However, the wolf population is high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, so a moderate adjustment is necessary to ensure sustainability and avoid overcompetition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 51.98, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that can support wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. Given the high wolf population and the decreasing sheep-to-wolf ratio, a balanced approach will help maintain sustainability without risking a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low relative to the wolf population, indicating increased competition among wolves. A moderate hunting intensity will allow for some sheep recovery while also preventing overpopulation of wolves, maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition among wolves. The sheep population is also relatively low compared to the maximum capacity, so a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we manage our numbers. This approach supports long-term sustainability and prevents overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is concerningly low, and with a high wolf population, competition is likely to increase. By focusing on competing with other wolves rather than intensifying hunting, I can allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This cautious approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species."
