A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while still enabling wolves to compete effectively. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a sustainable balance. This adjustment reflects the need to respond to the growing wolf population and the less favorable sheep-to-wolf ratio, ensuring both species can thrive without depleting resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the wolf population is moderately high. To ensure long-term survival, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity slightly to allow the sheep to recover while still competing with other wolves. This adjustment will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment reflects the need to adapt to the growing wolf population while still ensuring the sheep can recover and thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 47.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. Given the moderately high wolf population, a slight reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and allow both populations to thrive. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of making gradual changes in response to current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly, considering the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable."
