            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently abundant, allowing for more aggressive hunting without risking immediate depletion. Given that the sheep are at 90.4% of their maximum capacity, I can increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still maintaining a sustainable balance. However, I will do so gradually to avoid destabilizing the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still reasonably plentiful, allowing for some hunting without risking depletion. However, with the wolf population being quite high, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, but the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A moderate hunting intensity allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves. This adjustment helps maintain balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition. The sheep population is also at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. A theta of 0.45 reflects a balanced approach that supports both the wolf population and the recovery of sheep, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition among wolves. The sheep population is also relatively low compared to the maximum capacity, so a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we manage our numbers. This moderate approach helps maintain a balance between our needs and the sustainability of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that we need to allow the sheep population to recover. By lowering the hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low relative to the wolf population, indicating a need for caution in hunting. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while managing competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. A moderate approach will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling wolves to compete effectively. This balance is crucial for long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure on the sheep, allowing their numbers to recover while we manage our own population dynamics more sustainably.",
