            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 50.7% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. However, the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A gradual increase to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep population can recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment reflects the need to balance the growing wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while still enabling wolves to compete effectively. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem. This gradual adjustment will help ensure the long-term survival of both species."
