However, since the wolf population is moderately high, I will increase my hunting intensity gradually to ensure sustainability and avoid overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently healthy, but the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain our numbers while allowing the sheep to recover slightly, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful at 66.60, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. However, the wolf population is high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A moderate theta of 0.60 will help maintain a sustainable coexistence while still allowing for some hunting to support wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is at a moderate level, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A theta of 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, enabling some hunting to support reproduction while also considering the need to reduce competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment helps maintain sustainability in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition among wolves. The sheep population is also at a relatively low level compared to its maximum capacity. By lowering my hunting intensity slightly, I can help the sheep recover while still allowing for some hunting. This balance will support the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition among wolves. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that we need to allow the sheep population to recover. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species and maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This gradual adjustment will help ensure the long-term survival of both species."
