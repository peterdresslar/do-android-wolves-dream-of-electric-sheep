A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while still enabling the wolf population to thrive. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of making gradual changes to adapt to the current ecosystem state.",

A slight reduction in hunting intensity allows for a more balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for wolf population stability.",
