            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 177\n- Sheep population: 44.34\n- Wolf population: 23.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.350\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 1.93 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 40.3% of maximum capacity\n\nEcosystem observations:\n- The ratio of sheep to wolves is becoming less favorable, which may require adaptation.\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3. Adjust your hunting intensity gradually in response to population changes\n4. Find a balance that creates sustainable cycles rather than crashes\n5.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that we need to be cautious with our hunting to allow the sheep population to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance while still allowing for some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that we need to focus on competition among wolves rather than intensifying hunting. This will allow the sheep population to recover while we maintain our numbers. A gradual adjustment is essential to ensure sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain our wolf population while allowing for some recovery of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively low compared to the maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain its health. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments to ensure long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.8% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, so a gradual increase in hunting will help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, so I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A moderate increase to 0.45 allows for some growth in the wolf population while still considering the long-term health of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.7% of its maximum capacity, which allows for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, so a slight adjustment towards competition with other wolves is prudent to maintain balance. This theta value reflects a cautious approach to ensure both populations can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that the wolf population is growing relative to the sheep. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain their numbers. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of making gradual changes to ensure long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight increase in hunting intensity will allow for better wolf reproduction while still giving sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance."
