However, the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A gradual increase to 0.40 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring both populations can thrive without depleting resources too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while still maintaining enough pressure to support wolf reproduction. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments to ensure long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a sustainable balance. This gradual adjustment will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
