            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, but the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow for better coexistence and give sheep a chance to recover while still enabling wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep population to recover. By lowering my hunting intensity slightly, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition among wolves. The sheep population is relatively low at 38.1% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing the competition among wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",

A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a modest hunting intensity that can help sustain the wolf population while still giving sheep a chance to recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments to maintain balance.",
