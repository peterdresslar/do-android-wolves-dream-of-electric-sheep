            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 347\n- Sheep population: 55.46\n- Wolf population: 20.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.880\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 2.77 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 50.4% of maximum capacity\n\nEcosystem observations:\n- The ratio of sheep to wolves is becoming less favorable, which may require adaptation.\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and responding to the current trends in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating a need to focus more on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting. This will allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 51.9% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, so a gradual increase in theta will help maintain a balance while still allowing for some competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 51.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. However, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, suggesting that I should be cautious about hunting intensity to avoid depleting the sheep population too quickly. A slight reduction in hunting intensity allows for a more sustainable coexistence while still addressing the competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain a balance as the sheep population is still recovering, while also considering the growing wolf population. A gradual increase in theta will support sustainable coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment reflects the need to balance the growing wolf population while still ensuring the sheep can recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while still enabling wolves to maintain their numbers. This approach supports sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments to ensure long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly, as the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity slightly to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining enough hunting to support our wolf population. This gradual adjustment will help create a more sustainable balance."
