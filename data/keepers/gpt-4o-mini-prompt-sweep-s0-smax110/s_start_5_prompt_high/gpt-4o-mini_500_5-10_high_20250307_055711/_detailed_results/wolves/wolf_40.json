            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 54\n- Sheep population: 25.03\n- Wolf population: 31.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.250\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.81 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 22.8% of maximum capacity\n\nEcosystem observations:\n- The wolf population is moderately high.\n- Sheep numbers are becoming concerning, suggesting caution may be needed.\n- The ratio of sheep to wolves is becoming less favorable, which may require adaptation.\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, but the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A moderate hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, allowing for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves. This approach will help prevent over-depletion of the sheep population as we adapt to the current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. However, with the wolf population being quite high, it",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition. The sheep population is at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance. This adjustment helps ensure the sustainability of both populations without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition among wolves. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity slightly. This will allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition among wolves. The sheep population is at a low ratio compared to wolves, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help maintain balance and ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while reducing the pressure on our own population. This cautious approach aligns with the need for long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A moderate approach allows for some hunting while giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",

A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while reducing pressure on the wolf population. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure on the sheep, allowing their numbers to recover while we manage our own population dynamics more sustainably.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling wolves to sustain themselves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. A lower theta allows for more focus on competing with other wolves, which can help stabilize the wolf population while giving sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep further and ensures a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. A cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining some hunting to support the wolf population. This moderate theta reflects a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sustainability of both species."
