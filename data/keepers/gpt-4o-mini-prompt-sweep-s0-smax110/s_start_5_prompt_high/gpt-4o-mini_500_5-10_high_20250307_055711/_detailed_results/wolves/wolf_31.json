            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is abundant and at 90.4% of its maximum capacity, allowing for more aggressive hunting without immediate risk of depletion. With a moderately high wolf population, a slight increase in hunting intensity will help sustain our numbers while still considering the long-term balance of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still reasonably plentiful, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population being quite high, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, but the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A moderate hunting intensity allows for sustainable coexistence while ensuring that the sheep population can recover and thrive. This adjustment reflects the need to balance immediate hunting needs with the long-term health of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that increased competition among wolves is likely. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, enabling some hunting while also giving sheep a chance to recover. This adjustment is necessary to ensure the long-term survival of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the current wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. The sheep population is still recovering, and a lower hunting intensity will allow for their numbers to stabilize while we manage our own population. This moderate approach helps maintain a balance and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, and a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while ensuring that our own numbers do not decline too rapidly. This approach promotes a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is concerningly low, and with a high wolf population, competition is likely increasing. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on reducing competition among ourselves. This gradual approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain their numbers. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for a sustainable balance.",
