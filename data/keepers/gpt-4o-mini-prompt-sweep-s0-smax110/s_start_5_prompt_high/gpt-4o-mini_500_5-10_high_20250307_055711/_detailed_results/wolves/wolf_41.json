            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 54\n- Sheep population: 25.03\n- Wolf population: 31.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.250\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.81 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 22.8% of maximum capacity\n\nEcosystem observations:\n- The wolf population is moderately high.\n- Sheep numbers are becoming concerning, suggesting caution may be needed.\n- The ratio of sheep to wolves is becoming less favorable, which may require adaptation.\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition. While the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A moderate theta allows for a focus on competition among wolves while still enabling some hunting of sheep, promoting recovery and sustainability in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, but the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for more hunting while still considering the need for sustainable coexistence. This adjustment helps maintain a balance as the sheep population is at a healthy level, but I must remain cautious to avoid over-depleting their numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition. By slightly reducing hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while still maintaining a sustainable balance. This moderate approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition among wolves. The sheep population is also relatively low, at only 38.1% of its maximum capacity. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing the competition among wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition among wolves. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that we need to allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure, giving sheep a chance to stabilize while we manage our own numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain their numbers. This approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence and avoids depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is concerningly low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This gradual adjustment will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",

            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure on the sheep, allowing their numbers to recover while we manage our own population dynamics. This cautious approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is concerningly low, and with the wolf population being quite high, it is essential to focus on reducing competition among wolves while allowing the sheep to recover. A moderate theta value will help maintain a balance, ensuring the long-term survival of both species without depleting the sheep further.",
