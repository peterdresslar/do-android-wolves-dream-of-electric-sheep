A gradual increase in hunting intensity will support our long-term survival without risking a sudden depletion of sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is abundant and at 90.4% of its maximum capacity, allowing for more aggressive hunting without immediate risk of depletion. However, since the wolf population is moderately high, I will increase my hunting intensity only slightly to ensure we do not overexploit the sheep and maintain a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still reasonably plentiful, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population being relatively high, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while preventing over-depletion of the sheep. This balance helps maintain a sustainable ecosystem as the wolf population is currently high, and I want to avoid increasing competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the current wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. The sheep population is still relatively healthy, but the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, enabling us to maintain our numbers while giving sheep a chance to recover without depleting their population too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition among wolves. With the sheep population at a sustainable level but still below maximum capacity, a moderate hunting intensity will allow for some hunting while giving sheep a chance to recover. This balance will help maintain both populations over the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition among wolves. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, and the sheep population is still recovering. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to stabilize and grow, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem while also managing the competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta allows the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our own numbers. This gradual approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species."
