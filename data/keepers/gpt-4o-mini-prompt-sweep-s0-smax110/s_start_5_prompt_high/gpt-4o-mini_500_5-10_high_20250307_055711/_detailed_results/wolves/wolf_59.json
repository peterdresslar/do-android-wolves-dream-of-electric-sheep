            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. However, the wolf population is high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, so a balanced approach is necessary to ensure sustainable coexistence. This adjustment allows for some reproduction while still considering the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, and while the wolf population is high, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A theta of 0.60 allows for a balanced approach to hunting that can help sustain both populations while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep. This gradual adjustment will help maintain the delicate balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition. The sheep population is also relatively low at 38.1% of its maximum capacity, so a moderate hunting intensity will allow for some recovery of the sheep while still ensuring the wolves can sustain themselves. This balance will help avoid over-depletion of the sheep and promote long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition among wolves. The sheep population is also relatively low at 32.3% of its maximum capacity, so a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we manage our numbers. This moderate approach helps maintain a balance and avoids over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. By focusing on a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow sheep to recover while we manage our numbers more sustainably. This cautious approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain their numbers. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need to focus on competition among wolves rather than hunting sheep. This will allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a balance in the wolf population.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while still being mindful of the wolf population dynamics.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. A moderate approach allows for some hunting while also giving the sheep a chance to recover. This balance is crucial for the long-term survival of both species.",

To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep to recover. A gradual decrease in theta will help maintain balance without causing drastic changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A lower theta allows for more competition among wolves, which can help stabilize our population while giving sheep a chance to recover. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",

A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance without risking a crash in either population.",
