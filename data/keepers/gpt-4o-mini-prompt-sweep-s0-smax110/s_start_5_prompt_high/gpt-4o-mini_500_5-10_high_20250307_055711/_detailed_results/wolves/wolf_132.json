            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 51.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. However, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, suggesting that I should focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while also considering the gradual reduction in wolf population. A theta of 0.25 strikes a balance between competing with other wolves and allowing the sheep to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 51.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, suggesting that I need to be cautious about hunting intensity to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, enabling both populations to stabilize while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 50.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, suggesting that I should be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term balance between both populations.",

By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
