            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, so a gradual increase in hunting will help maintain our population while still allowing sheep to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 51.5% of its maximum capacity, which indicates that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, suggesting that I should be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring the long-term survival of both populations while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain the balance without depleting the sheep too quickly, allowing for gradual adaptation as conditions change.",

However, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, suggesting that I should be cautious in my hunting intensity to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight decrease in theta allows for a balanced approach, enabling the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population.",

However, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, suggesting that I should focus on competing with other wolves to stabilize our population while allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual adjustment to 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking a rapid depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain the wolf population while allowing for some recovery of the sheep. This adjustment is small enough to avoid drastic changes, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain the wolf population while allowing for some recovery of the sheep. This adjustment is gradual, aligning with the wisdom of adapting to changing conditions without causing sudden disruptions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 51.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep. However, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, suggesting that I should focus on maintaining a balance rather than intensifying hunting. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while also considering the need for the sheep population to recover and ensuring the wolf population remains stable.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 51.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. However, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, suggesting that I should focus on competition with other wolves to stabilize our population while allowing the sheep to recover. A moderate decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support the wolf population while still considering the need for sheep recovery. A gradual increase is necessary to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly, especially as the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable.",

However, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, suggesting that I should focus more on competing with other wolves to ensure a sustainable balance. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while also considering the current wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both sheep and wolves. This small adjustment reflects the need to adapt to the growing wolf population and the less favorable sheep-to-wolf ratio, ensuring we do not deplete the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. By reducing hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing competition among wolves. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both species.",
