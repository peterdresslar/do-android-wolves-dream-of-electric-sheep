            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 191\n- Sheep population: 48.55\n- Wolf population: 20.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.400\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 2.43 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 44.1% of maximum capacity\n\nEcosystem observations:\n- The ratio of sheep to wolves is becoming less favorable, which may require adaptation.\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that we need to focus on competing with other wolves to stabilize our population while allowing the sheep to recover. A moderate decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 41.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. However, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, suggesting that I should focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow for sheep recovery while also managing competition with other wolves. A slight decrease in theta will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.9% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that a moderate increase in hunting (from 0.35 to 0.40) can help maintain our population while still allowing sheep to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively low compared to the maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help sustain our wolf population while allowing for some recovery of the sheep. This adjustment is gradual, aligning with the wisdom of maintaining balance and adapting to the current ecosystem state.",

However, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, suggesting that I should be cautious and not over-hunt. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, enabling both sheep recovery and wolf population stability.",

A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain its health. This moderate approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments to ensure long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain the wolf population while allowing for some recovery of the sheep. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is some room for sustainable hunting. However, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, suggesting that I should focus on reducing hunting intensity slightly to allow for sheep recovery while still maintaining a healthy wolf population.",

The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, so a moderate approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both populations without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the ratio of sheep to wolves is becoming less favorable. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover gradually. This approach balances immediate needs with long-term sustainability.",

However, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, suggesting that I should be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still supporting the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, a moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain our population without depleting the sheep too quickly.

A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring both the wolf and sheep populations can thrive without risking depletion.",

This adjustment allows for a gradual response to the changing dynamics in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable.

This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",

A moderate decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem.",

This adjustment reflects the need to adapt to the changing sheep-to-wolf ratio while still prioritizing the long-term survival of both species.",

The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, suggesting that I should focus more on competing with other wolves to stabilize our population while allowing the sheep to recover.
