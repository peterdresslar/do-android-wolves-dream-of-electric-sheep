However, the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A moderate increase in hunting intensity allows for sustainable coexistence while also addressing the need to maintain a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population being moderately high and the sheep-to-wolf ratio becoming less favorable, a slight decrease in hunting intensity is warranted to allow for better balance and recovery of both populations. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of making gradual changes to maintain a healthy ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while still maintaining enough pressure to support wolf reproduction. This balanced approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to recover while ensuring our long-term survival."
