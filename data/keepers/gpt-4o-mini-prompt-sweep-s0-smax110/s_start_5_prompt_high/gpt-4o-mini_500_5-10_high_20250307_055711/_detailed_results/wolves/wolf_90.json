            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 293\n- Sheep population: 55.84\n- Wolf population: 26.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.400\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 2.15 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 50.8% of maximum capacity\n\nEcosystem observations:\n- The wolf population is moderately high.\n- The ratio of sheep to wolves is becoming less favorable, which may require adaptation.\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy, but the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for more hunting to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious to avoid depleting the sheep population too quickly. This approach helps maintain a balance as we adapt to the changing conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 51.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep. However, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, suggesting that I should focus on competing with other wolves to stabilize our population while allowing the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain balance without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking over-depletion. This adjustment reflects the need to adapt to the less favorable sheep-to-wolf ratio while still considering the long-term sustainability of both populations.",

A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow sheep to recover while still enabling wolves to maintain a sustainable population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of adapting to changing conditions without causing sudden shifts.",

This adjustment will help maintain a balance as the sheep population is still recovering, while also considering the growing wolf population. A gradual increase in theta will support our needs without risking a depletion of the sheep.",

However, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, suggesting that I should focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover while still competing with other wolves. A gradual adjustment to 0.35 reflects a balanced approach that supports both populations.",

However, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A moderate increase to 0.40 allows for sustainable coexistence while still addressing the needs of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensifying hunting. This will allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
