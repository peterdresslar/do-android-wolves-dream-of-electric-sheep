While the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling us to maintain a healthy wolf population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments to ensure long-term sustainability.",

The sheep population is reasonably plentiful, but the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable.

This will help maintain a sustainable cycle without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
