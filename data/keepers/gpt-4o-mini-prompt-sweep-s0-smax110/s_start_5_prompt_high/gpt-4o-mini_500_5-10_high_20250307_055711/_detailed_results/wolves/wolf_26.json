            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is abundant and close to its maximum capacity, allowing for a more aggressive hunting approach. However, I want to maintain a balance to ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep. A moderate increase to 0.55 allows for sustainable hunting while still considering the need to adapt to future changes in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is abundant and at 90.4% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a more aggressive hunting strategy. However, since the wolf population is moderately high, I will increase my hunting intensity gradually to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly and ensure sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, but the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A moderate hunting intensity will allow for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves. This adjustment will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, but the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A moderate approach allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some hunting to support our population. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition. The sheep population is also at a moderate level, so a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling wolves to compete effectively. This adjustment helps maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition among wolves. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, and a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while we manage our numbers. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low relative to the wolf population, indicating a need for a cautious approach. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity, I can help sustain the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition among wolves. The sheep population is also concerningly low, so a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our own numbers. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta allows for a focus on reducing competition and giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to sustain themselves.
