A moderate hunting intensity will allow for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves. This approach helps to balance the needs of both populations without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition among wolves. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, and a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while we adapt to the current conditions. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",

The sheep population is also relatively low compared to the maximum capacity, so a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we manage our own numbers. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
