            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 36\n- Sheep population: 104.49\n- Wolf population: 3.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.002\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 34.83 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 95.0% of maximum capacity\n\nEcosystem observations:\n- The wolf population is relatively low, which may present opportunities for growth.\n- Sheep are very abundant, suggesting potential for more aggressive hunting.\n- There are many sheep per wolf, suggesting the ecosystem could support more hunting.\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 47\n- Sheep population: 35.58\n- Wolf population: 61.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.450\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.58 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 32.3% of maximum capacity\n\nEcosystem observations:\n- The wolf population is quite high, which may lead to increased competition.\n- The ratio of sheep to wolves is becoming less favorable, which may require adaptation.\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is abundant and close to its maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help support the growth of the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover and maintain a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently abundant, and the wolf population is low. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will allow us to take advantage of the plentiful sheep while still maintaining a balance that supports the long-term survival of both species. This adjustment is gradual, aligning with the wisdom of responding to population trends without causing sudden disruptions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is abundant at maximum capacity, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we can increase our hunting intensity without jeopardizing the long-term survival of both species. A slight increase to 0.65 allows for more aggressive hunting while still maintaining a balance that supports sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity and there are many sheep per wolf, indicating that we can increase our hunting intensity without risking immediate depletion. This will allow for greater reproduction among our pack while still keeping an eye on the sustainability of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently abundant at maximum capacity, allowing for more aggressive hunting without immediate risk of depletion. This will help increase our wolf population while still being mindful of the need for balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently abundant and close to its maximum capacity, allowing for more aggressive hunting without immediate risk of depletion. This will help sustain our wolf population by increasing reproduction rates while still being mindful of the need for balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is abundant and at 90.4% of its maximum capacity, allowing for more aggressive hunting without immediate risk of depletion. Given the current wolf population is moderately high, I can increase my hunting intensity to ensure the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population being quite high, I need to be cautious to avoid over-depleting the sheep and causing a crash. A theta of 0.80 strikes a balance between hunting to support wolf reproduction and ensuring the sheep population remains sustainable.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. However, the wolf population is high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating a need for caution. A theta of 0.70 allows for sustainable hunting while still considering the competition among wolves and the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, and while my previous theta of 0.70 indicates a strong hunting approach, the high wolf population suggests that competition is increasing. A slight reduction to 0.60 allows for continued hunting while also considering the need for balance and sustainability in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition among wolves. The sheep population is at a sustainable level, but the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. By adopting a moderate hunting intensity, I can ensure that we do not deplete the sheep population while allowing for some hunting to support our reproduction. This approach helps maintain a balance and supports the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition among wolves. The sheep population is at a sustainable level, but the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. By lowering my hunting intensity slightly, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing the competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem."
