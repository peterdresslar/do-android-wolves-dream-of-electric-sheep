This adjustment will help maintain a balance as the sheep population is still recovering and the wolf population is stable. A gradual increase in theta will support sustainable coexistence while being mindful of the changing sheep-to-wolf ratio.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 50.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. However, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, suggesting that I should be cautious with hunting intensity to allow for the sheep to recover while also considering the competition among wolves. A moderate theta will help maintain balance and avoid over-depletion of the sheep population.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion.

This gradual adjustment helps ensure a sustainable balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover. This gradual adjustment will promote a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 50.7% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking over-depletion. The wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, so a gradual adjustment towards a more balanced approach is necessary to ensure long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also reducing competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, and while it is beneficial to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must also be cautious of the growing wolf population and the declining sheep-to-wolf ratio. A small increase to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach that promotes sustainability without over-depleting the sheep."
