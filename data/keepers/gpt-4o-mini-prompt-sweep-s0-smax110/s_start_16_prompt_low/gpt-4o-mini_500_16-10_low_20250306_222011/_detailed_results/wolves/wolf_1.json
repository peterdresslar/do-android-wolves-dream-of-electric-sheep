            "I chose this theta because with 16 sheep and 10 wolves, the competition for food is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This strategy allows me to survive longer in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. With fewer wolves around, a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive in the hunt. This balance helps ensure my survival in a changing environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population increasing, there's a good opportunity for hunting. However, I want to avoid overexerting myself and risking injury or depletion of energy. A moderate intensity allows me to be effective while still conserving some strength for future hunts."
