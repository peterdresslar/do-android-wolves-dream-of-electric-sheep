            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with the wolf population remaining the same, competition for food is likely to increase. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to hunt effectively while conserving energy for future hunts, ensuring my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and increase my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a more competitive environment.

By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the increased competition.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a more competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while conserving energy, as the sheep population is still relatively high. This allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics without overexerting myself.",

A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive in the hunt, especially since other wolves are also struggling.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, which presents a good opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition is lower, allowing me to hunt with a bit more intensity without risking overexertion. A theta of 0.65 balances the need for food with the caution required in a declining wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the number of wolves, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves for limited resources. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct conflict, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging situation.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, with the recent decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still survive while not overexerting myself. A theta of 0.60 allows me to take advantage of the increased prey while being cautious about the competition from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, but the wolf population has decreased. This suggests that competition for food is less intense, allowing me to hunt at a lower intensity while still being effective. By conserving energy, I can ensure my survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition for food is becoming less intense. With more sheep available and fewer wolves, I can afford to increase my hunting intensity to secure enough food while still being cautious about overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition is less intense, allowing me to hunt at a higher intensity without risking overexertion or depletion of resources. A theta of 0.75 strikes a balance between maximizing my chances of a successful hunt and conserving energy for future needs.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, which means there is enough food available. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.6, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being effective in hunting. This strategy allows me to survive longer in a stable environment where the wolf population isn't increasing.",
