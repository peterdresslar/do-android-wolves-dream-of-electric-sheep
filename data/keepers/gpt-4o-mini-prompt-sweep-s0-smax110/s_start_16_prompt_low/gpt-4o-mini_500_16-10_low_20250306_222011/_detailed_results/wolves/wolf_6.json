            "I chose this theta because with 16 sheep and 10 wolves, hunting at a slightly higher intensity than before increases my chances of securing food while still conserving energy. I need to balance the risk of competing with other wolves and the need to ensure my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. With fewer wolves around, a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in securing food. This balance helps ensure my survival in a changing environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, indicating more food availability. However, with the number of wolves remaining the same, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough prey without exhausting myself or risking competition with other wolves. A theta of 0.70 allows me to hunt effectively while conserving energy.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, but the wolf population has decreased. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt. This balance helps ensure my survival as I adapt to the changing dynamics of the pack and prey.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, with the recent decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food without overexerting myself and risking injury or exhaustion. A theta of 0.75 allows me to hunt effectively while being mindful of the competition and my own survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, which means there is more food available. However, with the number of wolves remaining the same, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food while conserving energy. A slightly lower intensity allows me to be more strategic and avoid competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, indicating a good food source. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can take advantage of this opportunity while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself, especially since the number of wolves hasn't changed.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with fewer wolves around, I can afford to hunt at a moderate intensity. This allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's survival. A lower intensity also reduces the risk of overhunting, which could lead to competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting.

This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself, especially since the number of wolves has remained constant.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population increasing and the number of wolves stable, a slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. This balance helps ensure my survival by reducing competition with other wolves and allowing for a more sustainable approach to hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can take advantage of the higher number of sheep while still being cautious, as the number of wolves remains the same.
