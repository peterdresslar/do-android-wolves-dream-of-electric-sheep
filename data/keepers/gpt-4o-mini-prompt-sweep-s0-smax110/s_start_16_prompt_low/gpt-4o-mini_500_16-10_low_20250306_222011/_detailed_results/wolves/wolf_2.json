By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success. This strategy allows me to survive longer in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with fewer wolves and an increase in sheep, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to balance the need for food while minimizing the risk of attracting too much attention from other wolves. This way, I can still secure a meal without overexerting myself or competing too fiercely with others.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, indicating a better food supply. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity, I can take advantage of this opportunity while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, and the number of wolves has decreased. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who may be hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and ensures my survival while still taking advantage of the available prey."
