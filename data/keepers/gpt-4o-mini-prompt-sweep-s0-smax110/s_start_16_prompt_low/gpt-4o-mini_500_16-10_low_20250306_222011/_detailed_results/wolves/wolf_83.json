            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still being mindful of the dwindling sheep population. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 15 wolves competing for food, a moderate increase in hunting intensity will help me secure enough resources without overexerting myself. This balance allows me to maintain energy for future hunts while still being competitive.",
            "I chose this theta because with an increasing number of wolves, competition for food is rising. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival in a more competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively low, and with 16 wolves competing for food, hunting at a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the number of sheep being relatively high compared to the stable wolf population, a lower hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively. This approach minimizes competition with other wolves and increases my chances of survival in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because with 41.17 sheep and 16 wolves, the competition for food is high. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to hunt effectively while conserving energy for future hunts. This approach allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself, ensuring my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased significantly, which means competition for food will be higher. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still being effective in securing food. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that food is becoming scarcer. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are likely to hunt at maximum intensity. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased slightly, indicating a stable food source. However, with the number of wolves remaining the same, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I have enough energy to compete with others while still being able to catch prey. A moderate increase in theta allows me to be more competitive without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased slightly, and the number of wolves remains the same. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can take advantage of the current situation without overexerting myself, ensuring I have enough energy for future hunts while still contributing to my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population decreasing, I need to increase my hunting intensity to secure enough food for survival. However, I must balance this with the risk of overexertion and competition from other wolves, so a theta of 0.70 allows me to be aggressive enough to catch prey while still conserving some energy.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By reducing my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still participating in the hunt.
