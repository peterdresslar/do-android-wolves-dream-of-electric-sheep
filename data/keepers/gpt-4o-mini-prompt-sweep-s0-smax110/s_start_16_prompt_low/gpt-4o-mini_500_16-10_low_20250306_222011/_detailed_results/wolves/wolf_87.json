            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population decreasing, I need to increase my hunting intensity slightly to ensure I can secure enough food for survival. However, I want to avoid overexerting myself, as the wolf population remains stable, and I must be cautious of competition.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and I want to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. A slightly lower intensity allows me to adapt to the current situation and avoid overexertion, which is crucial for my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the number of wolves.

            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, and with the wolf population stable, I can afford to hunt with a bit more intensity to maximize my chances of securing food while still being cautious. A theta of 0.60 balances the need for survival with the risk of overexertion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and with 17 wolves competing for food, a moderate increase in hunting intensity will help me secure enough resources without overexerting myself. This balance allows me to adapt to the current situation while still being mindful of the competition.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased slightly, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and still hunt effectively while being cautious about overexerting myself in a challenging environment. This balance helps ensure my survival without competing too aggressively with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population means competition for food is rising. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can better secure my share of the dwindling sheep population while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that food is becoming scarcer. By lowering my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This approach allows me to adapt to the current situation and increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting may be less fruitful. However, I still need to maintain a competitive edge over other wolves. A theta of 0.75 allows me to hunt effectively while conserving energy for future needs.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the stable number of wolves. By lowering my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to catch enough prey to survive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased slightly, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity from 0.65 to 0.75, I can better compete with other wolves for the available sheep while still being cautious about overexerting myself in a potentially low-resource environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating less food availability. By lowering my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy while still being competitive. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself, ensuring my survival in a challenging environment.",
