However, with the number of wolves remaining the same, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can secure enough food while avoiding competition with other wolves. A theta of 0.70 allows me to be aggressive enough to catch prey but not so intense that I risk exhausting myself or drawing too much attention from others.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. With the wolf population decreasing, a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive in the hunt. This balance helps ensure my survival in a changing environment.",

However, with the recent decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food without overexerting myself and risking injury or exhaustion. A theta of 0.70 allows me to be more effective while still being cautious.",

By reducing my intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, especially since the number of wolves has remained the same. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the current number of sheep being relatively high and the number of wolves remaining the same, I can afford to hunt at a lower intensity. This allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, as the competition among wolves is not increasing. A lower theta also reduces the risk of overexertion and potential injury, which is crucial for my survival.",
