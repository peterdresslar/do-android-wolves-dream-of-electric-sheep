            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting at maximum intensity less sustainable. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance increases my chances of survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making hunting more challenging. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.5, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion, ensuring I remain competitive without exhausting myself or attracting too much attention from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating that hunting may be more challenging. However, the increase in the wolf population suggests competition for food is rising. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can better compete with other wolves while still being mindful of the dwindling sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the increase in wolves means competition for food is rising. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's efforts. This balance helps ensure my survival without risking starvation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with the number of wolves remaining constant, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to overexploitation of the remaining sheep. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and ensure that I have enough resources for future hunts while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the overall population of wolves is also declining. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while avoiding overexertion that could lead to depletion of resources. This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the current situation and ensure my survival without risking too much energy.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the competition among wolves is high. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while conserving energy, as hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable given the current population dynamics.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can take advantage of the dwindling sheep population while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.5, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the wolf population is also declining. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still allowing for some hunting to ensure my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the number of wolves, and hunting at a lower intensity will help conserve energy while still allowing for some success in catching prey. This approach balances the need for food with the risk of overexertion in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low, and the recent decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition for food is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased slightly, indicating a potential for more food. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition is fierce. By choosing a moderate intensity, I can balance the need to hunt effectively while conserving energy and avoiding overexertion, which is crucial for my survival.",
