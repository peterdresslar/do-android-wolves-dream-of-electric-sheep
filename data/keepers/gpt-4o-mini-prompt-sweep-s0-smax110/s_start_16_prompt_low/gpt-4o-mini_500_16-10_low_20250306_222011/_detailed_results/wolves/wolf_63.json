            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a more cautious approach. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the sheep population while still conserving energy and avoiding overexertion in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the number of sheep increasing and the wolf population stable, I can afford to increase my hunting intensity slightly. This will help me secure enough food while still being cautious, as other wolves may also be hunting at maximum intensity.",
            "I chose this theta because with an increase in the wolf population and a decrease in sheep, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves for limited resources. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's needs.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 15 wolves, competition is present but not overwhelming. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the available prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population means more competition for the available sheep. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",

            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, which presents a good opportunity for hunting. However, with the wolf population remaining the same, I want to balance my hunting intensity to avoid overexertion and ensure I have enough energy for future hunts. A theta of 0.55 allows me to be more efficient while still taking advantage of the available prey.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success. This way, I can avoid competition and ensure my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased slightly, indicating a potential scarcity of food.
