            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and I want to balance my energy expenditure with the need to secure food. Increasing my hunting intensity slightly will help me compete with other wolves while still conserving some energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, competition for food is increasing. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts, ensuring my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, competition for food is higher, so a lower intensity will help conserve energy while still allowing for opportunistic hunting. This way, I can adapt to the changing environment and increase my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making them more scarce. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and less food for everyone. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, balancing my needs with the current population dynamics.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the wolf population has increased. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still contributing to the pack's success. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests that competition for food will be higher. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This balance allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics without overexerting myself, ensuring my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, and the number of wolves is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves for the dwindling sheep. This strategy allows me to survive longer while waiting for a more favorable situation.",
            "I chose this theta because with the increase in the wolf population, competition for food is rising. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to hunt effectively while conserving energy and avoiding overexertion. This strategy allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics of the pack and the declining sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With an increase in the wolf population, competition for food will be higher. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's efforts. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy. This balance is crucial for my survival, especially with the growing wolf population competing for the same resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around and fewer sheep to hunt, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making food scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to hunt effectively while conserving energy for future hunts, especially since the number of wolves is increasing.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with the wolf population remaining constant, hunting at full intensity may lead to overexploitation of the remaining sheep. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and increase my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while conserving energy, as the sheep population is still relatively high compared to the wolf population. This approach allows me to adapt to the current situation and improve my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the population of sheep has decreased, and the number of wolves is still high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still being cautious. This approach allows me to adapt to the declining prey availability without overexerting myself, which could lead to greater risks.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food.

By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition, ensuring my survival in this challenging environment.",
