            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, which means food is scarcer. By lowering my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This allows me to adapt to the changing environment and increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy while still allowing for some hunting opportunities. This balance increases my chances of survival in a competitive environment.",

            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. However, with an increase in the wolf population, I need to be more competitive to secure my share of the food.

            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at a higher intensity increases my chances of securing food while still being cautious about overexerting myself. A theta of 0.75 balances the need for food with the risk of competition.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. With an increase in the wolf population, competition for food will be higher. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively if necessary. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With the increase in the wolf population, competition for food will be higher. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving some energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with more wolves around, competition for food is increasing.

This balance may help ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
