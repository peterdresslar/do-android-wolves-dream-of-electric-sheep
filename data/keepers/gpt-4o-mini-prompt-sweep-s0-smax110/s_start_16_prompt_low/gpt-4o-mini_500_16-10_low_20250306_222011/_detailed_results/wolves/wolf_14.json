            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and with the recent increase in wolves, a lower hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. This strategy helps ensure my survival by avoiding overexertion and potential competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in both sheep and wolves suggests a competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can take advantage of the available food while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a potentially crowded hunting scenario.",
            "I chose this theta because with an increase in the wolf population, competition for food is intensifying. By lowering my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",

            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting more competitive among wolves. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, competition for food is higher, so a lower intensity will help conserve energy while still allowing for some hunting. This balance increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",

By adjusting my intensity to 0.50, I can still contribute to the hunt while conserving energy and avoiding unnecessary risks.",

By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving some energy for future hunts.",

This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with the number of wolves remaining the same, hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable.
