            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts. This way, I can adapt to the changing environment and increase my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, competition for food is higher, so a lower intensity will help conserve energy while still allowing for opportunistic hunting. This balance increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population means competition for food is rising. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.65, I can better secure food while still conserving energy, as the sheep population has decreased. This balance helps ensure my survival in a more competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means food is becoming scarcer. With more wolves in the area, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and overexploitation of the remaining sheep. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves while still contributing to the hunt when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, while the wolf population has increased. A lower hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive. This balance increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, competition for food is high, and a lower intensity will help conserve energy while still allowing for opportunistic hunting. This strategy increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making hunting more competitive. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival as the wolf population is increasing.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making them a more valuable target. With the increase in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough prey while not exhausting myself or risking confrontation with other wolves. A theta of 0.75 allows me to hunt effectively without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and the increase in wolves means competition for food is rising. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid drawing too much attention to myself while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is increasing. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while conserving energy, as hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable given the current population dynamics.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, who are also struggling. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current environment and increase my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexerting myself, especially since the wolf population has also decreased. This approach allows me to be more strategic in my hunting while still increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the number of wolves, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves for the limited prey. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment.

By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid drawing attention while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can secure enough food while also conserving energy. A moderate intensity allows me to be competitive without overexerting myself in a declining wolf population.",
