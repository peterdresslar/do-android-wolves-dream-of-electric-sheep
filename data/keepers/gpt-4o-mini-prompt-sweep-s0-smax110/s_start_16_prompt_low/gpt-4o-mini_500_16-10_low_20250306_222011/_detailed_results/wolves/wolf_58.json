            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are likely hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to survive longer in a challenging environment.",

By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also struggling. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current environment while still being able to hunt effectively when conditions improve.",
            "I chose this theta because the population of sheep is still relatively high, and I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can catch enough food without overexerting myself. With other wolves also hunting, a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive.",

This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
