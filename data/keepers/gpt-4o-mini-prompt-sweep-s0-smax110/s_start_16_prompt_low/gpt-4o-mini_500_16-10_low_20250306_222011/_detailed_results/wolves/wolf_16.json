            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a more cautious approach. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still taking advantage of the available prey. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because with an increase in both sheep and wolves, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves. By increasing my intensity slightly, I can still contribute to my survival while avoiding overexertion and potential conflict with pack mates.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, competition for food is higher, so a lower intensity will help conserve energy while still allowing for opportunistic hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population means competition for food is rising. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still being effective in securing food. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a potentially scarce environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the number of wolves has increased. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt when opportunities arise. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. With more wolves around, a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive in the hunt. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and reduce competition for the remaining sheep. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By adjusting my hunting intensity to a moderate level, I can balance the need to secure food while avoiding overexertion and risking injury. This way, I can conserve energy and still contribute to the pack's success.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of successfully catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment with increasing wolf numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can maximize my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with increasing wolf numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and while the wolf population has increased, I want to balance my hunting efforts to ensure I can still find food without exhausting my energy. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. Increasing my hunting intensity will improve my chances of catching prey while still being mindful of the rising wolf population. A balance between aggression and caution is necessary for survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with the number of wolves remaining constant, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and overhunting. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt, ensuring my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting more competitive among wolves. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while conserving energy, as the competition among wolves is high. This allows me to adapt to the changing conditions and increase my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high due to their recent decline. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
