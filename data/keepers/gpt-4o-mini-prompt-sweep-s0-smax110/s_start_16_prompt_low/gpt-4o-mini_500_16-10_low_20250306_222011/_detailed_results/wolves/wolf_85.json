This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a potentially dwindling food situation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, with the number of wolves remaining the same, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I still have a chance to catch prey while avoiding overexertion and competition with other wolves. A slightly higher intensity than before allows me to take advantage of the increased sheep without risking too much energy.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and I want to increase my chances of a successful hunt without overexerting myself. By raising my intensity slightly from my previous level, I can capitalize on the available food while still conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, but the wolf population remains the same. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still taking advantage of the available prey. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased slightly, and the number of wolves remains constant. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still contributing to the hunt if necessary. This balance helps ensure my survival in a fluctuating environment."
