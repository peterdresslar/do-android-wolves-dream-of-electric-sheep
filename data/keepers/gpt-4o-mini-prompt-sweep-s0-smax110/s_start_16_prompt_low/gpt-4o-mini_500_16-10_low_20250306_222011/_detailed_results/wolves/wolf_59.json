By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still taking advantage of the available prey. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, and the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition for food is less intense. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can balance the need to secure food while conserving energy and avoiding overexertion, which is crucial for my survival in a declining wolf population.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition is fierce. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can take advantage of the abundant prey while still being cautious about the risks posed by other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself.

However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests that hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves and potential overhunting. By lowering my intensity to 0.45, I can conserve energy and still contribute to the pack's survival while being cautious about the dwindling wolf numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population increasing and the number of wolves remaining constant, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can secure enough food without overexerting myself. A theta of 0.60 allows me to hunt effectively while conserving energy for future hunts, especially since other wolves are also competing for the same resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, with the recent decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still compete with others while not overexerting myself.
