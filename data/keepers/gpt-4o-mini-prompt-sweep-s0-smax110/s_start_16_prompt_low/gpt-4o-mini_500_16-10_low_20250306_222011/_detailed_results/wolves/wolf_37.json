By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion, ensuring I can still survive while being mindful of the dwindling prey and competition.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and I need to increase my hunting intensity to secure enough food for survival. However, I must be cautious not to overexert myself, as the recent decrease in the wolf population indicates competition for resources is increasing.",

This way, I can adapt to the situation without overexerting myself, ensuring my survival in the long run.",
