            "I chose this theta because the population of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.65, I can improve my chances of catching sheep while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a more competitive environment.",

By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves for the remaining sheep. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",

With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and failure. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and wait for better opportunities while still contributing to the pack's success.",

A theta of 0.65 balances the need for food with the current competition.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity reduces competition for food and increases my chances of survival by conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making them a scarcer resource.
