            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. With the wolf population increasing, hunting at a slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts. This strategy balances the need to secure food without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population decreasing and the number of wolves remaining stable, it is wise to conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively. A moderate intensity allows me to balance the risk of competition with other wolves while ensuring I can still secure enough food for survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and I want to increase my chances of a successful hunt without overexerting myself. By raising my intensity slightly from my previous theta, I can take advantage of the current situation while still conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased slightly, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity from 0.65 to 0.75, I can improve my chances of catching enough prey while still being mindful of the competition from other wolves. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",

This way, I can avoid overexertion and increase my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating less food availability.
