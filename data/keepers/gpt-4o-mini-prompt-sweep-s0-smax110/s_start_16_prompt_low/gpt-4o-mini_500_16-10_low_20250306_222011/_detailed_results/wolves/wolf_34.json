            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and reduce competition for the remaining sheep. This balanced approach increases my chances of survival while still allowing for opportunistic hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, I need to increase my hunting intensity to ensure I can catch enough food for survival. A theta of 0.70 balances the need for increased effort while still conserving some energy for future hunts.",

By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion, allowing me to adapt to the current scarcity while still being cautious of the competition from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can maximize my chances of securing food while still being cautious not to overexert myself, given the declining prey availability. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging situation.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the number of wolves, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves for the same prey. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's survival. This balanced approach allows me to adapt to the current situation and increase my chances of survival.",
