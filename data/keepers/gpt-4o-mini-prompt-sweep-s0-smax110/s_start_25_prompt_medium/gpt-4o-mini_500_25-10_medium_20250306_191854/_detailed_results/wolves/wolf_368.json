            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting approach. This will help maintain the balance between wolf and sheep populations while avoiding overhunting, which could lead to future scarcity. A slight increase from my previous theta reflects the healthy sheep population, but I will remain cautious to ensure long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, and while it is beneficial to increase hunting slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must also consider the growing wolf population. A theta of 0.40 allows for a balanced approach that supports both species without risking a rapid depletion of sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 39.14, which is only 35.6% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balanced approach. By gradually increasing theta, I can support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly. This ensures both species can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 30.57, which is only 27.8% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.50, which is only 22.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still competing with other wolves. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.05, which is only 18.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a more balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still being mindful of the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.08, which is only 15.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A gradual increase in theta will help us avoid depleting the sheep further while still ensuring our pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.81, which is only 13.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase to 0.40 allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.41, which is only 12.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.4 to 0.35, I can still maintain some hunting intensity while prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both populations. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of avoiding sudden changes and responding to the current state of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.30, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking over-depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.65, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to be cautious with our hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of both populations. It also reflects the need to reduce hunting intensity slightly as the wolf population is relatively high at 34.00.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.11, which is only 10.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the immediate needs of the wolf pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.92, which is only 9.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population dynamics.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.78, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and avoid depleting their numbers further, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting intensively. This will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem and ensure the long-term survival of both species."
