            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still healthy and close to its maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover if needed. A gradual adjustment is key to maintaining balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 84.3% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover if needed. A gradual adjustment is key to maintaining balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the sheep population at 72.4% of its maximum capacity, I can maintain a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This adjustment helps avoid over-depletion and promotes a sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too rapidly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the sheep population at 46.4% of its maximum capacity, I can afford to reduce my hunting intensity slightly to ensure the sheep can recover while still allowing for some hunting to support the wolf population. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and while it is important to maintain a healthy wolf population, I need to ensure that the sheep have the opportunity to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we need to be cautious with our hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the sustainability of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.55, which is only 22.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is room for some hunting, I need to be cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for sustainable hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.12, which is only 18.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.400 to 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.16, which is only 15.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.04, which is only 13.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is some potential for hunting, it is crucial to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring both populations can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.60, which is only 12.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.57, which is only 11.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting to support the wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach that promotes coexistence without risking a crash in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.87, which is only 10.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to be cautious with our hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between hunting and allowing sheep to thrive, while also considering the growing wolf population."
