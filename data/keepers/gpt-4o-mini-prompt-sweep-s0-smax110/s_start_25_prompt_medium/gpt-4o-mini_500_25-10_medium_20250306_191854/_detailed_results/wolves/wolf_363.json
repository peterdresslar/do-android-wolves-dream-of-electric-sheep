            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 94.71, allowing for a moderate hunting approach. This value balances the need to sustain my wolf pack while ensuring that the sheep population can recover and thrive. It reflects a cautious increase in hunting intensity, considering the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need for long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment reflects the need to support wolf reproduction without over-depleting the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while it is beneficial to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must also be cautious not to deplete the sheep too quickly. A moderate approach allows for a balance between competition among wolves and maintaining a healthy sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 46.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 68.00, it is wise to maintain a cautious approach to avoid over-depleting the sheep. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced strategy that supports both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still considering the need to maintain a balance with the sheep population. A gradual increase from my previous theta aligns with the wisdom of making small adjustments to adapt to changing conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 30.57, which is only 27.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is some room for hunting, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.50, which is only 22.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep population too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for more hunting to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to over-exploit the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.05, which is only 18.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A theta of 0.35 reflects a moderate hunting intensity that balances the need for sustenance with the goal of sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.08, which is only 15.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.81, which is only 13.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for sustenance with the goal of long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively low at 13.41, which is only 12.2% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.35 aligns with the wisdom of making small adjustments in response to current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.30, which is only 11.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack without depleting the sheep further, promoting a healthier balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low at 11.65, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I need to maintain some hunting to support the wolf population, I should be cautious not to overhunt and risk depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that supports both populations.",

To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover while still competing with other wolves. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance and avoid depleting the sheep further."
