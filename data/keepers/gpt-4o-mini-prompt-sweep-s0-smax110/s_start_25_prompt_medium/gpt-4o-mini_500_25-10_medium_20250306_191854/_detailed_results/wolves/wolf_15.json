            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 81.6% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without overly depleting the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still healthy at 93.35, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. This moderate theta will help maintain the sheep population while ensuring the wolf pack can sustain itself. It reflects a cautious strategy, allowing for slight increases in hunting intensity without risking a rapid depletion of sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that can sustain both populations. This value reflects a cautious approach, ensuring that while I can hunt effectively, I also allow the sheep to recover and maintain a healthy balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 88.0% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover if needed. A gradual increase to 0.55 reflects a balanced approach, considering both the current state and the trends in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 96.23, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. Maintaining a theta of 0.50 supports sustainable coexistence while ensuring that the wolf population remains healthy. This moderate intensity allows for gradual adjustments as conditions change, preventing overhunting and promoting long-term stability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a moderate hunting approach that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This value reflects a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 81.1% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a sustainable coexistence as the wolf population is currently stable.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 66.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with a wolf population of 45, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing sheep to recover. A gradual increase aligns with the current trends and ensures a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, and while it is beneficial to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must also consider the current wolf population. With the sheep-to-wolf ratio being close to 1, a more balanced approach will help prevent over-depletion of the sheep while allowing for gradual adjustments as conditions change.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support the wolf population while still considering the long-term health of the sheep. A gradual increase aligns with the current trends and avoids sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and while it is important to maintain a healthy wolf population, I need to allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help ensure that both populations can stabilize and thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 29.65, which is only 27.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I can increase hunting intensity slightly, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A moderate increase to 0.45 allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still considering the long-term health of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.18, which is only 22.9% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.72, which is only 19.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for more hunting while still considering the long-term balance needed for both populations."
