            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and a moderate hunting intensity will allow for coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves. This approach balances the need to hunt with the necessity of allowing the sheep population to recover, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 23.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. While I want to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I also need to allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and prevent over-depletion of the sheep, while still allowing for some hunting to support wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can continue to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while I want to increase hunting to support wolf reproduction, I must also consider the potential for overhunting. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, enabling both sheep recovery and wolf population stability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 28.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with a wolf population of 8.00, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for more hunting while still maintaining a balance that supports both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is key to avoiding sudden population crashes.",

A moderate theta allows for some hunting while ensuring the sheep population can recover and thrive, preventing future crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while it is beneficial to maintain some hunting to support wolf reproduction, I want to avoid over-depleting the sheep. A slight reduction in hunting intensity allows for a balanced approach, ensuring both populations can thrive without risking a crash.",
