            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 59.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population also being relatively high, a moderate approach allows for continued coexistence while preventing over-depletion of the sheep. This adjustment reflects a balance between hunting intensity and competition with other wolves, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting approach. This will help maintain the balance between the wolf and sheep populations while avoiding overhunting. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need to ensure both populations can thrive, a slight reduction in hunting intensity is prudent.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 30.56, which is only 27.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is some opportunity for hunting, it is crucial to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can stabilize and grow.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.55, which is only 22.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support our wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a more balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some growth in our numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.12, which is only 18.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on a balanced approach that allows the sheep population to recover while still competing with other wolves. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 reflects a cautious strategy that prioritizes sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.16, which is only 15.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting without risking immediate depletion. However, with a wolf population of 54, I need to be cautious and avoid over-hunting to ensure our long-term survival. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that supports both reproduction and sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.04, which is only 13.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it is essential to do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population, ensuring a sustainable balance.",

A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support our wolf population without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.87, which is only 10.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be increased slightly to help sustain our population, but not too aggressively, as the wolf population is also significant at 34. I aim for a balanced approach that allows for gradual recovery of the sheep while ensuring our pack remains healthy.",

This suggests that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 allows for some hunting but prioritizes competition among wolves, ensuring that we do not deplete the sheep further.",

This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.04, which is only 11.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still being mindful of the need to compete with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.68, which is only 12.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A moderate theta value of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack while giving sheep a chance to rebound, ensuring long-term balance."
