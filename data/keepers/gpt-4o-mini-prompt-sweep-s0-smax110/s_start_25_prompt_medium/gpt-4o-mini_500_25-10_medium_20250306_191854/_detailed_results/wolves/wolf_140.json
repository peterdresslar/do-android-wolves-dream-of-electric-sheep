            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition with other wolves. A gradual increase in theta is necessary, but for now, a lower value will help maintain balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while ensuring that the sheep population has a chance to stabilize and grow, promoting long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that we should be cautious with our hunting to avoid depleting their numbers. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support our wolf population while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to depletion of their numbers. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in sheep numbers, jeopardizing the long-term survival of both species. Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover while keeping the wolf population stable.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while managing competition with other wolves. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This approach helps maintain a balance in the ecosystem and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is close to its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring both can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 96.09, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while maintaining a sustainable balance, as the sheep population is not yet at maximum capacity. A gradual increase is prudent to avoid sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 75.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, the wolf population is also significant, and I need to ensure that we do not overhunt and deplete the sheep too quickly. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will allow for sustainable coexistence while still supporting our pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a balanced approach. With the sheep-to-wolf ratio being slightly above 1, it indicates that while there is enough food, we should not overhunt to ensure the sheep can continue to thrive. A moderate theta will help maintain the balance between hunting and competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, as it allows for sustainable coexistence without depleting the sheep population too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 37.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. Given the wolf population is relatively high at 70, I want to focus on reducing competition among wolves while allowing the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance, ensuring both populations can thrive without depleting resources too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.56, which is only 28.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done gradually to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach that supports both wolf reproduction and sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.70, which is only 23.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still being mindful of the wolf population growth.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.65, which is only 18.8% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, allowing both populations to stabilize without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.91, which is only 15.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep population while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our own health. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, reducing hunting intensity slightly to give sheep a chance to recover while still competing with other wolves."
