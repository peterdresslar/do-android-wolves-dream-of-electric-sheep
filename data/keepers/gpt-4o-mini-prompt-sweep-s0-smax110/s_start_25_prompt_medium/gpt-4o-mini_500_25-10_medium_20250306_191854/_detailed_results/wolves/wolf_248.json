            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 235\n- Sheep population: 61.26\n- Wolf population: 65.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.656\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.94 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 55.7% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain our wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A small adjustment from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, responding to the current conditions without risking a depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and while I want to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I need to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.45 strikes a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.85, which is only 25.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a more balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to support reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively low at 21.78, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A moderate increase from my previous theta of 0.400 aligns with the need for balance and sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.74, which is only 16.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to allow for recovery. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the competition with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.35, which is only 14.0% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will enable me to hunt more effectively without depleting the sheep population too quickly, maintaining a balance that supports both species in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.41, which is only 12.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to recover while still enabling my pack to compete with other wolves. A gradual approach helps maintain balance and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.29, which is only 11.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting without risking the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.30, which means we need to be cautious with our hunting to allow their numbers to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance, but I must avoid overhunting to ensure both our survival and the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and my previous theta was already on the lower end. A slight increase to 0.40 allows for a modest increase in hunting intensity, which can help sustain my pack while still allowing the sheep population to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.47, which is only 9.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can help ensure the sheep population stabilizes while still allowing for some hunting to maintain the wolf population. This moderate approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.33, which is only 9.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are struggling, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to recover. Additionally, with a wolf population of 25.00, focusing on competition among wolves rather than intense hunting will help maintain our numbers while giving sheep a chance to rebound.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.42, which is only 9.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should be cautious with our hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.57, which is only 9.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should be cautious with our hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover. However, since the wolf population is relatively high at 19.00, a slight increase in theta to 0.40 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term balance of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.77, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.4 to 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, promoting a sustainable balance without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.16, which is only 10.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that the sheep can recover if I reduce my hunting intensity slightly. By increasing theta to 0.40, I maintain a balance that allows for some hunting while also giving the sheep a chance to rebound, ensuring long-term sustainability for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.97, which is only 10.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A slight decrease from my previous theta of 0.45 will help balance our needs without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.54, which is only 11.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly.
