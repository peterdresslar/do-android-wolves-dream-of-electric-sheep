By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover and maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem. This approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, as well as prevent overexploitation of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. A gradual decrease in hunting will help maintain balance without causing sudden population crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize our population while ensuring the sheep can rebound, promoting long-term coexistence.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers, jeopardizing both species",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, I must remain cautious and avoid overhunting, as the wolf population is also relatively stable. A gradual increase to 0.40 allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves.",

By slightly reducing my hunting intensity to 0.40, I can allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. This approach balances the needs of both species and supports long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 48.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 68, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to prevent a crash in the sheep population. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 40.98, which is only 37.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for more hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance that supports both the wolf and sheep populations.",

This suggests that while I need to maintain a focus on hunting to support the wolf population, I should do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach, promoting sustainable coexistence while still addressing the needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.82, which is only 18.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more moderate hunting intensity is necessary to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity from 0.45 to 0.40, I can focus on sustainable coexistence and prevent over-depletion of the sheep, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.45, which is only 15.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it is important to do so gradually to avoid depleting the sheep further.
