            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 102\n- Sheep population: 12.64\n- Wolf population: 39.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.400\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.32 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 11.5% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. A moderate hunting intensity will allow for some sheep harvesting while giving the population time to recover and ensuring that the wolf pack remains healthy. This balance will help prevent overexploitation of the sheep and maintain a sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is close to its maximum capacity, indicating that we should be cautious with our hunting to avoid depleting their numbers too quickly. A moderate increase in hunting intensity allows for some reproduction among wolves while still giving sheep a chance to recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 95.31, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 47.00, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure sustainable coexistence. A gradual increase to 0.45 reflects a balanced approach that considers both current conditions and the need for future stability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, but still below maximum capacity. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to thrive. This approach maintains a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring sustainable hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing sheep to recover. It is important to avoid drastic changes, so a moderate increase aligns with the current ecosystem dynamics.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 49.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 67, which is relatively high compared to the sheep, I need to be cautious. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, allowing the sheep to recover while also preventing overcompetition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery. A moderate increase aligns with the current dynamics of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 29.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is some room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, it's important to avoid overhunting to ensure both populations can thrive. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a more cautious approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity to ensure the wolf population can thrive, I must do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.50, which is only 18.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus more on competing with other wolves to stabilize our population while allowing the sheep to gradually increase. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.39, which is only 15.8% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to help sustain our wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A gradual increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for some hunting while still considering the long-term health of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.26, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should prioritize allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 reflects a cautious approach to balance competition with other wolves and sustainable hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.69, which is only 12.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase to 0.40 allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.64, which is only 11.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to allow for sheep recovery. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring a balanced approach that supports both populations."
