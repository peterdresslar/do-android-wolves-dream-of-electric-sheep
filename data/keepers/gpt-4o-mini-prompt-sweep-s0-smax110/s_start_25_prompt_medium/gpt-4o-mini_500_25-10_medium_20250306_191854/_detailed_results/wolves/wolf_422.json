            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 93.7% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover if needed. A gradual adjustment is key to maintaining balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is key to maintaining balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, but I want to ensure that we do not overhunt them as the wolf population is also significant. A slight reduction in hunting intensity allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 59.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population being nearly equal to the sheep population, a moderate approach is necessary to avoid over-depleting the sheep while still allowing for some hunting to support wolf reproduction. This theta value reflects a careful balance between hunting and competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the sustainability of both populations. This adjustment will help maintain a balance as the sheep recover and the wolf population stabilizes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 35.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both species can thrive. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach to hunting while still considering the long-term health of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 27.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.45, it is wise to slightly reduce hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while still competing with other wolves. This moderate approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.55, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a need for caution in hunting. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while still competing with other wolves. This moderate approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.12, which is only 18.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some recovery while still ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.16, which is only 15.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.04, which is only 13.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain my pack while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.60, which is only 12.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A gradual increase in hunting intensity is necessary, but we must be cautious not to deplete the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.57, which is only 11.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some reproduction among wolves while still giving sheep a chance to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep population too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.87, which is only 10.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population without depleting the sheep further."
