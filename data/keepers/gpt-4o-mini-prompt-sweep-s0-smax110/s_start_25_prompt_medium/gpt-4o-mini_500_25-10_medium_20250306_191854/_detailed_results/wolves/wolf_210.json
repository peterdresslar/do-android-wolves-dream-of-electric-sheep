            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta reflects a balanced approach, as the sheep population is stable, but I must remain cautious to avoid depleting their numbers too quickly. This adjustment supports sustainable coexistence while still allowing for some reproduction among the wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. A moderate theta value will help maintain a balance between our population and the sheep, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. With the current sheep-to-wolf ratio being high, focusing on competition among wolves will help stabilize our population while giving sheep a chance to rebound.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition with other wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that they can sustain a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. A theta of 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the health of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still healthy at 93.3% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with a wolf population of 40, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 83.2% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate hunting approach. This will help maintain a balance between the wolf and sheep populations, ensuring that we do not deplete the sheep too quickly while still allowing for some hunting to support our wolf population. A slight decrease from my previous theta reflects a cautious approach as the wolf population is also significant, promoting coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment reflects the need to support wolf reproduction while still considering the health of the sheep population. A gradual increase helps maintain balance and avoids sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to ensure that both populations can thrive without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover over time. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 36.02, which is only 32.7% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves to allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain a balance and prevent overhunting, which could lead to a crash in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.85, which is only 25.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to overhunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.78, which is only 19.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for more hunting to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to overhunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.74, which is only 16.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By lowering my hunting intensity slightly, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some sustainable hunting. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.35, which is only 14.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some reproduction among wolves while still giving sheep a chance to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting sustainability without risking a crash in the sheep population."
