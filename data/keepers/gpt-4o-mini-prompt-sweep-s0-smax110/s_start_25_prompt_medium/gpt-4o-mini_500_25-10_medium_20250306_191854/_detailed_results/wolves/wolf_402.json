Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover while we focus on competition among wolves, ensuring our population remains stable.",

A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep.",

This adjustment allows for sustainable coexistence while also supporting the wolf population",
