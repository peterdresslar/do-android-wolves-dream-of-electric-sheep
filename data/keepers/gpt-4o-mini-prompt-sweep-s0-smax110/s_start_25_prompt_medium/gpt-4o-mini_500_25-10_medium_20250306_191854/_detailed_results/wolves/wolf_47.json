With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.63, it is essential to maintain a balance that allows for the recovery of the sheep while also ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. A moderate theta of 0.30 allows for a focus on competition with other wolves, which will help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to increase.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain our wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is key to avoiding sudden population crashes.",

A moderate hunting intensity will allow for some sheep population growth while also preventing overcompetition among wolves. This balance will help maintain the ecosystem",

While I want to maintain a healthy wolf population, I also need to ensure that the sheep can recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow for a more sustainable balance between the two populations, promoting coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 29.65, which is only 27.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain our wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for more hunting while still prioritizing the long-term balance between both populations.",

This approach aims to balance the needs of both populations and avoid sudden changes.",

This suggests that a more conservative approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By lowering my hunting intensity slightly, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some sustainable hunting.
