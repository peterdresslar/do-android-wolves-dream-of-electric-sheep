            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and my previous theta was quite low. A gradual increase to 0.25 allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still focusing on competition with other wolves. This approach helps maintain a balance, allowing both populations to thrive without risking a sudden decline in sheep numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations while avoiding overexploitation. Gradually increasing theta will support wolf reproduction without risking a crash in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still maintaining a sustainable balance with the sheep population. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio, a moderate increase in theta will help ensure that we do not over-deplete the sheep, allowing both populations to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 82.71, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly, as they are at 75.2% of their maximum capacity. A gradual increase aligns with the wisdom of adapting to changing conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because it represents a balanced approach to hunting. The sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while I want to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I also need to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta will help maintain this balance while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring both populations can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for some hunting without risking depletion. Given that the wolf population is slightly higher than the sheep population, a small reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and allow both populations to stabilize and recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.63, which is only 32.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, a more moderate approach is prudent to allow the sheep to recover. Additionally, with the wolf population at 57, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population also being relatively high, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.18, which is only 22.9% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, allowing both populations to stabilize without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.72, which is only 19.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is potential for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 allows for more hunting intensity while still being cautious, promoting both wolf reproduction and sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.37, which is only 17.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that the sheep are under pressure, and while I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must prioritize the recovery of the sheep. A lower theta allows for competition with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to rebound, promoting long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the wolf population is relatively high. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain our numbers without depleting the sheep too quickly. This adjustment aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence while allowing for gradual recovery of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are not enough sheep to sustain aggressive hunting. A moderate approach will allow the sheep to recover while also considering the growing wolf population. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance in the ecosystem."
