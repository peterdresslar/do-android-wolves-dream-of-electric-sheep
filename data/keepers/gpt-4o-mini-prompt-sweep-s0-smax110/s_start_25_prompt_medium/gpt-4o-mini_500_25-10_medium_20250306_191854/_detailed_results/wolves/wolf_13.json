However, with a wolf population of 11, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite high at 7.79, suggesting that we should focus on competing with other wolves rather than intensifying hunting. A theta of 0.3 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the recovery of sheep and maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing sheep to recover and thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 95.26, allowing for a moderate hunting approach. This will help maintain a balance between the wolf and sheep populations while allowing for some hunting to support wolf reproduction. Gradually reducing hunting intensity is wise as the wolf population is already at 17, which is significant, and we want to avoid over-depleting the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because it represents a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balanced approach. The sheep population is relatively high at 96.77, allowing for some increased hunting without risking depletion. This adjustment helps support wolf reproduction while keeping an eye on the sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently healthy at 96.23, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep do not become over-depleted. A moderate theta of 0.55 strikes a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 94.08, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. This moderate theta value will help maintain the sheep population while ensuring the wolf pack remains healthy. It reflects a cautious strategy that adapts to the current conditions without risking overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 81.1% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that can support wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep population does not decline too rapidly. This balance will help maintain a sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while I want to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I need to be cautious about overhunting. A slight decrease in hunting intensity allows for a balance that supports both populations without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover gradually.",

However, with the wolf population at 51.00, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both populations can thrive. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that supports coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",

However, with the wolf population at 57.00, I need to be cautious about overhunting. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain a healthy population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.63, which is only 32.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I can increase my hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate increase to 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of the wolf population.",

With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.54, it is important to maintain a balance that allows for some hunting while also considering the potential for sheep recovery. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help ensure the long-term survival of both populations, allowing wolves to adapt to the current conditions without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
