A moderate theta value will help balance the needs of both wolves and sheep, ensuring sustainable coexistence while still allowing for some hunting.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderate to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring both populations can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while ensuring the sheep have a chance to rebound.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery. Maintaining a lower theta will help ensure that both sheep and wolves can coexist sustainably without depleting resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery. Maintaining a lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, as it prevents overhunting and allows the sheep population to stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and a moderate increase in hunting intensity will allow for some population control while still enabling the sheep to recover. This approach balances the needs of both wolves and sheep, ensuring sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 93.7% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 41.00, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 84.3% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate hunting approach. This will help maintain a balance between the wolf and sheep populations, ensuring that we do not over-deplete the sheep while still allowing for some hunting to support our wolf population. A slight decrease from my previous theta reflects the need to be cautious as the wolf population is also significant.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual increase is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but with a slight increase in hunting intensity, I can help ensure the wolf population remains healthy without depleting the sheep too quickly. This moderate adjustment allows for a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, and the wolf population is relatively high. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to compete effectively. This adjustment supports a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 39.29, which is only 35.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is potential for recovery in the sheep population. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity to 0.40, I can support the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 30.56, which is only 27.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of the wolf population.",

This suggests that there is a need to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a focus on competition with other wolves. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",
