            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy, and my previous theta was quite low. A gradual increase to 0.25 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the competition with other wolves. This approach will help maintain a balance and prevent over-depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because it allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. Given that the sheep population is at 74.9% of its maximum capacity, a moderate approach will help maintain balance and ensure the long-term survival of both species. This adjustment also considers the current wolf population, allowing for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still promoting coexistence. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to capitalize on the sheep population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 49.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 67, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to allow both populations to thrive. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach that supports my pack while ensuring the sheep can recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 38.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 69, I need to be cautious about over-hunting. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 29.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to prevent a crash in the sheep population. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on maintaining a balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.30, which is only 23.0% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing competition with other wolves, which will help stabilize the wolf population without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.50, which is only 18.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.39, which is only 15.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from the previous theta of 0.40 to 0.35, I can still maintain some hunting activity while prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both populations. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.26, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.69, which is only 12.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This gradual adjustment helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.64, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking over-depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a balance as the wolf population is relatively stable, and I want to ensure that both populations can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.88, which is only 10.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.400 to 0.35, I can maintain a balance that supports both the wolf population and the sheep, ensuring sustainable coexistence while avoiding overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.37, which is only 10.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting sheep. This will allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a healthy balance in the wolf population."
