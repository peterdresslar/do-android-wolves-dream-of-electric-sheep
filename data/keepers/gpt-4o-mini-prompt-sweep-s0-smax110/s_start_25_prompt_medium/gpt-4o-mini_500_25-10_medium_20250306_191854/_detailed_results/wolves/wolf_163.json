            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 96.09, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both populations. This moderate adjustment helps to ensure that the wolf population can thrive without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 75.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with the wolf population at 56, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both populations can thrive. A moderate increase in theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. It reflects a balanced approach, responding to the current conditions without risking over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for some increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. Given the wolf population is also significant, a slight increase in theta will help maintain our numbers while ensuring the sheep can recover sustainably.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 37.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 70, it is wise to maintain a moderate hunting intensity to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly while still allowing for some reproduction among wolves. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.56, which is only 28.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack without depleting the sheep further, promoting a more balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.70, which is only 23.4% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still being cautious. A gradual increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, enabling us to sustain our wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.65, which is only 18.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.91, which is only 15.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to recover while still enabling the wolf population to compete effectively. Gradually reducing hunting intensity will help maintain a balance and prevent a crash in the sheep population, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.72, which is only 13.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting sustainability without risking a dramatic decline in sheep numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.12, which is only 11.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 reflects a balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to support reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.01, which is only 10.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some recovery of the sheep while still ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.27, which is only 10.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, reducing competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to rebound.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.80, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some sheep population recovery while still ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without risking a rapid depletion of the sheep."
