            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 245\n- Sheep population: 10.78\n- Wolf population: 32.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.350\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.34 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 9.8% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 91.56, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while maintaining a balanced approach. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 69.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still a healthy number of sheep available. However, with the wolf population at 58, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, but the wolf population is slightly high. A moderate decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while also preventing overcompetition among wolves. This approach supports a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without overly depleting the sheep population, ensuring long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 36.02, which is only 32.7% of its maximum capacity. While I want to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I also recognize the need to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.40 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, allowing for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.85, which is only 25.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a moderate increase in hunting intensity is appropriate to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A theta of 0.45 allows for a gradual increase in hunting while still considering the need for balance and the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.78, which is only 19.8% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance and promote sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.74, which is only 16.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.35, which is only 14.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.41, which is only 12.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep further, promoting a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.29, which is only 11.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still being mindful of the need to avoid overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.30, which is only 10.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population. This gradual adjustment helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.78, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.35 to 0.40, I can still focus on maintaining a healthy wolf population while being mindful of the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.47, which is only 9.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also considering the growing wolf population. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance and prevent over-exploitation of the sheep, ensuring long-term survival for both species."
