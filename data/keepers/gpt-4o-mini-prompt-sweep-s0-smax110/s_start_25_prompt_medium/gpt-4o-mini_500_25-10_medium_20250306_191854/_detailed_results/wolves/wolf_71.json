            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that we should not increase hunting intensity further. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring that we can sustain both our wolf population and the sheep. This adjustment helps prevent overhunting while still allowing for some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution in hunting to prevent depletion. A lower theta allows for competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. With a high sheep-to-wolf ratio, focusing on competition among wolves will help maintain our population while giving the sheep a chance to rebound.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to depletion of their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution in hunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to maintain wolf health while still prioritizing the recovery of sheep. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover and prevent overexploitation. This moderate approach will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be cautiously increased to prevent over-depletion. However, given the current wolf population and the need for sustainable coexistence, a moderate increase allows for a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and a slight increase in hunting intensity will help manage their numbers while still allowing for recovery. This adjustment supports sustainable coexistence and prevents overpopulation of sheep, which could lead to a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help sustain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual increase is essential to maintain balance and avoid sudden crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 95.31, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while avoiding over-depletion of the sheep. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to ensure both populations can thrive together.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 62.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating there is still room for growth. However, with the wolf population also being relatively high, a slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow for better balance and sustainability. This adjustment will help prevent over-depletion of the sheep while still allowing for some hunting to support wolf reproduction.",

However, with the wolf population at 69, which is relatively high, I need to be cautious not to overhunt and risk depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.30, which is only 23.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.450 allows for a balanced approach, focusing on maintaining both wolf and sheep populations while avoiding competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.50, which is only 18.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that the sheep need some time to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This gradual approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
