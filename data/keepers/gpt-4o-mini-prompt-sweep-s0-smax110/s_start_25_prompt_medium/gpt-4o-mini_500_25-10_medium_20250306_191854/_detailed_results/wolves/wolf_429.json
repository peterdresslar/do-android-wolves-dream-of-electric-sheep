            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 84.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.89, it suggests that while there are enough sheep to sustain some hunting, I need to be cautious to avoid depleting their numbers too quickly. A theta of 0.25 allows for a gradual increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the competition with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 72.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, my previous theta was quite low at 0.25, and I need to gradually increase my hunting intensity to ensure the wolf population remains stable and can reproduce effectively. A theta of 0.35 allows for a moderate increase in hunting while still considering the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual increase is prudent to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, and while it is beneficial to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must also be cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A gradual increase allows for a sustainable balance as both populations adjust.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 35.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 69, it",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.55, which is only 22.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a more balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.12, which is only 18.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring a balance that supports both populations over time.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.16, which is only 15.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach that encourages sustainability while still considering the need to compete with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.04, which is only 13.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population, ensuring a sustainable balance.",

This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.57, which is only 11.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing our need to hunt with the necessity of not depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.87, which is only 10.8% of its maximum capacity. Given the high wolf population of 34, it is crucial to focus on reducing competition among wolves to allow for a sustainable recovery of the sheep. A lower theta will help maintain balance and prevent overhunting, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.44, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low at 0.38. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will enable me to hunt a bit more effectively while still prioritizing the long-term balance of the ecosystem.",

This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some reproduction among wolves while still giving sheep a chance to recover.
