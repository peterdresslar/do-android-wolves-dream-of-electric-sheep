            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. A gradual increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance while avoiding over-depletion of the sheep, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A lower theta will help reduce competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to rebound, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery. Maintaining a lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, as it prevents overhunting and promotes a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. A moderate increase to 0.40 balances the need for wolf reproduction with the sustainability of the sheep population, ensuring both can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 93.7% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf reproduction and sheep sustainability, as the sheep population is still below maximum capacity. A gradual increase in theta will support both populations without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 72.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still a healthy number of sheep available. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.40, it is wise to maintain a moderate hunting intensity to ensure the sustainability of both populations. This theta allows for a balanced approach, enabling the wolf population to thrive while preventing overhunting of sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 59.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population being nearly equal to the sheep population, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This will help support wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance and avoid over-depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and while it is important to maintain a balance, I need to be cautious about over-hunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 30.56, which is only 27.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help balance the ecosystem without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.55, which is only 22.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.12, which is only 18.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 reflects a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without risking a rapid depletion of sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.16, which is only 15.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting a lower theta value, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize while still ensuring the wolf pack remains healthy. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.04, which is only 13.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a more balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery."
