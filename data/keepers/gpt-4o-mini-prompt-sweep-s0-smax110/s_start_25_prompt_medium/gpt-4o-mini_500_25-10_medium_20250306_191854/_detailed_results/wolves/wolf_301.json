            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, and while I want to ensure my pack thrives, I also recognize the importance of allowing the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, ensuring both populations can sustain themselves over time.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 37.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 69, which is relatively high, I need to be cautious about overhunting. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain a healthy population.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.49, which is only 23.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is some room for hunting, I need to be cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.82, which is only 18.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to help sustain my pack while allowing the sheep population to recover. A moderate increase from my previous theta of 0.400 will help balance the needs of both wolves and sheep without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.45, which is only 15.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a lower hunting intensity is necessary to allow the sheep to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus more on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.35, which is only 14.0% of its maximum capacity. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help sustain our wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover gradually. This moderate adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.62, which is only 12.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for some hunting while prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both populations.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.89, which is only 9.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing more on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population.",
