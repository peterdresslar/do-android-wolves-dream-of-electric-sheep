            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a gradual increase in hunting intensity while ensuring that the sheep can recover. This moderate approach helps maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and hunting, promoting the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 88.0% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 20.00, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 96.23, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 94.08, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to maintain balance as the wolf population is stable, and it allows for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 81.1% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, but still below maximum capacity. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to thrive. This approach maintains a balance that supports both species without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population also being significant, I want to ensure we don",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 46.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. A moderate approach allows for sustainable coexistence while also considering the current wolf population, which is slightly higher than the sheep population. This balance will help prevent overhunting and ensure both populations can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment reflects a balance between ensuring our wolf population remains healthy while allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual approach is essential to maintain stability in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still considering the long-term health of the sheep population. A gradual increase is prudent given the current dynamics.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and while it is important to maintain a healthy wolf population, I need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to rebound while still enabling wolves to compete effectively with one another.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.18, which is only 22.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while we need to hunt to support our wolf population, we should do so cautiously to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 will help maintain a balance between hunting and ensuring the sheep population can rebound.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.72, which is only 19.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing our competition with other wolves. A moderate theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance, ensuring the long-term survival of both populations without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I need to maintain a focus on hunting to support the wolf population, I must also be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a moderate approach that balances hunting with the need for sheep recovery."
