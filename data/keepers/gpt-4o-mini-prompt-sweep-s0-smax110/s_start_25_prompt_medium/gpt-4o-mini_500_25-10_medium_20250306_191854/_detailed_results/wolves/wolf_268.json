Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover while we focus on competition among wolves, ensuring a balanced ecosystem.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while ensuring the sheep population has a chance to stabilize and grow, which is essential for long-term balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderate to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population does not decline too rapidly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 4.07, it is crucial to focus on competition among wolves to ensure our long-term survival while preventing overhunting.",

A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance.",

This allows for some growth in the wolf population while still giving sheep a chance to recover. It\u2019s important to avoid overhunting, so a gradual approach is best.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 88.2% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 46, it's important to avoid overhunting to ensure sustainability. A gradual increase to 0.45 allows for a balanced approach that supports both wolf reproduction and sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, but with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.50, it indicates that while there is enough food, I should be cautious. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a more balanced approach, ensuring that both populations can thrive without risking overhunting.",

However, with the wolf population at 69, I need to be cautious about overhunting to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for more hunting while still considering the long-term balance.",

However, with the wolf population at 69, which is relatively high compared to the sheep, I need to be cautious. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain a healthy population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.49, which is only 23.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.82, which is only 18.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting to sustain the wolf population.
