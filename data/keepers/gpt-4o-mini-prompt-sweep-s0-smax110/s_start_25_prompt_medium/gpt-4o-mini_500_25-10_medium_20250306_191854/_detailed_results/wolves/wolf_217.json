            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating a need for careful hunting to prevent depletion while still allowing for wolf reproduction. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain the balance without risking a crash in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and while I want to maintain a healthy wolf population, I also need to ensure that the sheep do not become too depleted. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help sustain our numbers while allowing the sheep to recover slightly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 93.3% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that can sustain both populations. This value balances the need for hunting to support wolf reproduction while avoiding over-depletion of the sheep, ensuring long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 83.2% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity. This approach balances the need for wolf reproduction with the sustainability of the sheep population, ensuring that we do not deplete their numbers too quickly while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This value reflects a balanced approach, enabling sustainable coexistence while still allowing for some reproduction among wolves. It also accounts for the need to be cautious as the wolf population grows.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to ensure we do not over-deplete the sheep while also considering the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery. A gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 36.02, which is only 32.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight reduction in hunting intensity allows for a more sustainable balance, giving sheep a chance to recover while still enabling wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.85, which is only 25.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.78, which is only 19.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is a need to allow the sheep to recover while also considering the growing wolf population of 64. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further, promoting a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.74, which is only 16.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still being mindful of the need to avoid overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.35, which is only 14.0% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting, but not enough to deplete the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.41, which is only 12.2% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 to 0.40 reflects a cautious approach to hunting, balancing the need for sustenance with the importance of not depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.29, which is only 11.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring a balance that supports both populations in the long term."
