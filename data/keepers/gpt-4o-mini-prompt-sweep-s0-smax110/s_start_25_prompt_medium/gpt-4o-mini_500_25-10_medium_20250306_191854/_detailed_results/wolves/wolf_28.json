            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This balance helps maintain a sustainable ecosystem without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 81.1% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 34, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure sustainability. A moderate increase to 0.45 allows for some growth in wolf numbers while still keeping an eye on the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, but I want to ensure that we do not overhunt and deplete their numbers too quickly. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a more balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still enabling some hunting to support our population. This adjustment will help maintain a sustainable cycle.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, but I want to ensure that we do not overhunt and deplete their numbers too quickly. A slight reduction in hunting intensity allows for a sustainable balance while still enabling our wolf population to thrive. This approach will help maintain the delicate ecosystem and avoid potential crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and while it is important to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery. A gradual increase aligns with the wisdom of maintaining balance and responding to population trends.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 27.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 55, it is wise to maintain a cautious approach to avoid over-depleting the sheep. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced strategy that supports both wolf reproduction and sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.18, which is only 22.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased slightly to support wolf reproduction, it is crucial to avoid overhunting to allow the sheep population to recover. A moderate increase to 0.45 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for sustenance with the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.72, which is only 19.7% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.37, which is only 17.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.56, which is only 16.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting strategy to ensure our wolf population remains healthy. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for sustenance with the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.48, which is only 15.0% of its maximum capacity. While I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A slight increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, enabling sustainable coexistence while still considering the need for gradual adjustments based on population trends.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.59, which is only 14.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to allow for recovery. A moderate theta value of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the sheep"
