            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 83.45, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while ensuring that the sheep can recover. This adjustment maintains a balance between competing with other wolves and hunting, promoting sustainability in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the sheep-to-wolf ratio being slightly above 1, it is wise to maintain a moderate hunting intensity to ensure both populations can thrive without depleting resources. This adjustment allows for gradual adaptation to the current conditions while keeping an eye on future trends.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep. This adjustment reflects the need to maintain a sustainable coexistence as the wolf population is relatively high.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 37.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 70, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both populations can thrive. A slight decrease in hunting intensity allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.56, which is only 28.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased slightly, it is crucial to avoid overhunting to allow the sheep population to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.70, which is only 23.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.65, which is only 18.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 allows for more hunting intensity while still being cautious, as the wolf population is relatively high at 61.00. This adjustment aims to maintain a balance that supports both populations in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.91, which is only 15.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By lowering my hunting intensity slightly, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some sustainable hunting. This will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem and ensure both populations can thrive in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.72, which is only 13.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain our wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for our pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.12, which is only 11.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support our wolf population without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.01, which is only 10.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach to hunting while still being mindful of the wolf population, which is relatively high at 39. This adjustment will help maintain a sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.27, which is only 10.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.4 to 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting. This will help maintain a balance between the populations and avoid depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.80, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.51, which is only 9.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is a need to hunt for the survival of my pack, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, ensuring both populations can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.41, which is only 9.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.35 to 0.40, I can maintain a balance between hunting and allowing the sheep population to stabilize, while also being mindful of the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.40, which is only 9.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population. This balance is crucial for long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.54, which is only 9.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover.
