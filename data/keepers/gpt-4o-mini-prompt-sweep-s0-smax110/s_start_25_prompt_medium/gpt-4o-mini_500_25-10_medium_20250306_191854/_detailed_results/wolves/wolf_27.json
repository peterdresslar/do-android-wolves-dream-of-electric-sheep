            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 40\n- Sheep population: 16.48\n- Wolf population: 36.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.350\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.46 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 15.0% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 94.08, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while ensuring that the sheep population remains sustainable. A gradual approach is essential to maintain balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 89.16, allowing for some increased hunting intensity without risking depletion. However, I want to avoid overexploitation, so a moderate reduction from my previous theta of 0.850 will help maintain a balance as the wolf population grows.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the sheep population at 66.9% of maximum capacity, I can maintain a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of gradual changes and helps avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is key to avoiding sudden population crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. This value will help maintain the sheep population while still allowing for some hunting to support the wolf population. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the trends in both populations, a slight reduction in hunting intensity is prudent to ensure sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and while it is important to maintain a healthy wolf population, I want to allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help ensure that we do not deplete the sheep further while still allowing for some hunting to support our needs.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.63, which is only 32.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I can increase my hunting intensity slightly, I must do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A theta of 0.45 allows for a moderate increase in hunting while still prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and while it is important to maintain a balance, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves to allow for a recovery of both sheep and wolf populations. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.18, which is only 22.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for increased hunting without risking immediate depletion. However, the wolf population is relatively high at 52.00, indicating that a more moderate approach is necessary to avoid overexploitation of the sheep. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for sustainable hunting while still considering the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.72, which is only 19.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population and maintaining a balance with the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.37, which is only 17.6% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach to hunting while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.56, which is only 16.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover rather than intensifying our hunting. A moderate theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.48, which is only 15.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly."
