            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly, considering the current trends in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but still below maximum capacity. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach to hunting, ensuring that I can maintain the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of my ancestors to adapt to changing conditions without causing sudden shifts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 27.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 68, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both species can thrive. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that supports reproduction while still considering the long-term health of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.55, which is only 22.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is some room for hunting, I need to be cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still giving sheep a chance to recover."
