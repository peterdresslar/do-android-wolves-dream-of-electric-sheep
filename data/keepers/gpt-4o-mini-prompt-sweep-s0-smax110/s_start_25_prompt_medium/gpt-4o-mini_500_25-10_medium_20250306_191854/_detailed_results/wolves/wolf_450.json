            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 473\n- Sheep population: 18.59\n- Wolf population: 6.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.400\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 3.10 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 16.9% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 59.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population being nearly equal to the sheep population, a moderate approach is necessary to avoid over-depletion of sheep while still allowing for some hunting to support wolf reproduction. This theta value reflects a balanced strategy that promotes coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 35.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a wolf population of 69, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is low, suggesting that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 30.56, which is only 27.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some recovery of the sheep while still ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach that considers both the immediate needs of the wolves and the long-term sustainability of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.55, which is only 22.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep too quickly, aligning with the wisdom of making gradual adjustments.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.12, which is only 18.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I need to focus on hunting to support the wolf population, I must also be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while still giving the sheep a chance to recover, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.16, which is only 15.6% of its maximum capacity. While I need to increase my hunting intensity to ensure the survival of my pack, I must do so gradually to avoid depleting the sheep population further. A slight increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.04, which is only 13.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a lower hunting intensity is necessary to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35, I can focus more on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring a sustainable balance.",

This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for food with the sustainability of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.87, which is only 10.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should be cautious with our hunting to allow the sheep to recover. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.35, there is still some opportunity for hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach that can help sustain both populations.",
