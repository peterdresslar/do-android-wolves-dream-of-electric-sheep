            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 247\n- Sheep population: 10.33\n- Wolf population: 25.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.350\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.41 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 9.4% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently healthy at 91.56, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing sheep to recover and thrive. A gradual approach ensures we avoid depleting the sheep too quickly and maintains balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity while still ensuring their recovery. This balance will help maintain both wolf and sheep populations sustainably, as the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we can afford to hunt a bit more without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the sheep population at 61.26 and the wolf population at 65.00, a moderate theta will help maintain coexistence while ensuring that both populations can thrive. This adjustment reflects the need to avoid overhunting while still allowing for some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 43.3% of its maximum capacity, which indicates that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, it is wise to maintain a moderate hunting intensity to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly while allowing for some competition among wolves. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 36.02, which is only 32.7% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I also want to allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, allowing both populations to stabilize without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.85, which is only 25.3% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.400 helps maintain balance and avoids sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.78, which is only 19.8% of its maximum capacity. While I want to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I also recognize the need to allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, allowing both populations to stabilize without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.74, which is only 16.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, ensuring we do not over-deplete the sheep while still competing effectively with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.35, which is only 14.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should be cautious with our hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for some hunting while still prioritizing the sustainability of both populations. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.2% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we are competing for limited resources. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.29, which is only 11.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking the sheep population too much. A gradual increase to 0.40 allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling the wolf population to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.30, which is only 10.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.4 to 0.35, I can still maintain some hunting activity while prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both populations. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.78, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should be cautious with our hunting to allow the sheep to recover. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.34, there is still some room for moderate hunting to ensure our wolf population remains healthy. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach that supports both our needs and the sustainability of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.47, which is only 9.5% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help create a more sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.33, which is only 9.4% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and prevent overhunting, I will focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensifying my hunting. This will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem and ensure the long-term survival of both species."
