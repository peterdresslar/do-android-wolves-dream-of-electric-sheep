            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 89\n- Sheep population: 109.26\n- Wolf population: 34.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.374\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 3.21 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 99.3% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and a slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep too quickly. This moderate approach allows for sustainable coexistence while still supporting the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help sustain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual increase is essential to maintain balance and avoid sudden shifts that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 95.31, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while preventing over-depletion of the sheep. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to maintain balance, considering the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment reflects a balance between ensuring the wolf population remains healthy while allowing the sheep to recover and thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 62.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population also being significant, I want to avoid overhunting and allow for a gradual recovery of the sheep. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain balance while still allowing for some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 49.4% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring both can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 38.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. While my previous theta was 0.450, I want to slightly reduce my hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover and increase their numbers, which will benefit the long-term survival of both species. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.39, which is only 29.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I can increase my hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. A small increase to 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.30, which is only 23.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, enabling me to maintain wolf health while still being cautious about the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.50, which is only 18.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.39, which is only 15.8% of its maximum capacity. While I need to maintain a balance between hunting and competing with other wolves, a slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted to help sustain my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.26, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to allow the sheep to recover while still ensuring our wolf population remains stable. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.69, which is only 12.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is potential for recovery if I reduce hunting intensity slightly. By increasing theta from 0.35 to 0.40, I can still maintain some hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
