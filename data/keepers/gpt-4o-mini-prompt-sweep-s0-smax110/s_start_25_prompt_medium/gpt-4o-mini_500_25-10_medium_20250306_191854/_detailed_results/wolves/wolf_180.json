However, the wolf population is also significant, and my previous theta was very low. To ensure a gradual recovery of the sheep while still allowing for some hunting, I will increase my theta slightly to focus on competition with other wolves while allowing the sheep to stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 47.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, which is relatively high, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A moderate increase to 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term balance between both populations.",

However, with the wolf population at 70, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both populations can thrive. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that supports my pack while still considering the long-term health of the sheep.",

This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.4 to 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.70, which is only 23.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring both populations can thrive.",

A theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking a rapid depletion of the sheep, ensuring a more sustainable balance.",

This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain my pack while allowing the sheep population to recover.

This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.41, which is only 9.5% of its maximum capacity.
