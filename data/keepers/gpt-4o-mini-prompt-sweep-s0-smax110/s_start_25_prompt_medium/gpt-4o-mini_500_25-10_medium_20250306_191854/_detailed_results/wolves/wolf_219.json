            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that they can sustain a moderate increase in hunting intensity without leading to depletion. A theta of 0.75 allows for continued reproduction among wolves while still being mindful of the sheep population's health, ensuring a balance that supports both species in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while maintaining a sustainable balance with the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 91.56, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This value reflects a balanced approach, considering the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while I want to maintain a healthy wolf population, I also recognize the need to allow the sheep to recover slightly. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help balance the needs of both populations without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while I want to increase hunting to support wolf reproduction, I must also consider the growing wolf population. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring that both sheep and wolves can thrive without depleting resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 43.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 69, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain a healthy population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must do so gradually to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that considers both the current sheep population and the growing wolf numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.85, which is only 25.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is a need to allow the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack while prioritizing the long-term balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.78, which is only 19.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.74, which is only 16.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate increase to 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population, ensuring long-term sustainability for both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.35, which is only 14.0% of its maximum capacity. While I need to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must do so gradually to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.41, which is only 12.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for sustenance with the long-term health of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.29, which is only 11.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room to increase hunting intensity slightly without risking immediate depletion of the sheep. A small increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery."
