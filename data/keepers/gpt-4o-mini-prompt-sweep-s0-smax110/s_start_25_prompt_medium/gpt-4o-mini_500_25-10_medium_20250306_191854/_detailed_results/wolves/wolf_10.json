However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 8.60, it is crucial to avoid overhunting to ensure the long-term survival of both species. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while also focusing on competition with other wolves, which can help stabilize our population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 66.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with a wolf population of 8, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite high at 9.11, suggesting that I should be cautious about overhunting. A moderate increase to 0.40 allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still enabling the sheep population to recover and maintain balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 77.19, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 81.55, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we have enough prey to sustain our pack without overhunting. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a more cautious approach, ensuring that we maintain a balance while still allowing for some hunting to support our population.",

This moderate adjustment helps maintain a balance between our needs and the sustainability of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 81.6% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate hunting approach. This will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations while avoiding overhunting. Gradually reducing hunting intensity as the wolf population grows will also support long-term sustainability.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and while I want to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I also need to allow the sheep to recover slightly. A moderate decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and prevent over-depletion of the sheep, while still allowing for some hunting to support wolf reproduction.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 96.23, allowing for a slight decrease in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain the sheep population while allowing the wolf population to stabilize. By keeping the theta moderate, I can ensure a balanced approach that supports both species in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 94.08, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while maintaining a sustainable balance with the sheep population. A gradual increase is prudent as it aligns with the current trends and avoids sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",

This adjustment will help sustain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover and thrive. It reflects a balanced approach to ensure both species can coexist without depleting resources.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for some hunting without risking depletion. Given the wolf population is slightly higher than the sheep population, a small reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and allow both populations to stabilize. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of avoiding sudden changes and responding to current trends.",

A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a more balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still enabling some hunting.",
