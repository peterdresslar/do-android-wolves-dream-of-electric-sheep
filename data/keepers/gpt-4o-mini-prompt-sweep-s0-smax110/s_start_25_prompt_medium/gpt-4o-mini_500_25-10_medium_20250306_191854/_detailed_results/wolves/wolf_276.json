            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and my previous theta was very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover. A gradual increase in theta will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and my previous theta was quite low. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity further to allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition with other wolves. A gradual increase from my previous theta will help maintain balance without causing sudden population crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. A gradual increase from my previous theta will help maintain balance while avoiding over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is very close to its maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can sustain itself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is close to its maximum capacity, indicating that we should be cautious with our hunting to avoid depleting their numbers too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support our population while still prioritizing the sustainability of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 88.2% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 46, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while still maintaining a sustainable balance with the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while it is beneficial to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must also consider the potential for overhunting. A small decrease from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach that balances competition with other wolves while ensuring the sheep population can recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a sustainable balance. This adjustment reflects the need to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly, ensuring long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level (37.3% of maximum capacity), and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are not enough sheep to support aggressive hunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This balanced approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.43, which is only 29.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.49, which is only 23.2% of its maximum capacity. While I want to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.45 to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for some hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.82, which is only 18.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to allow for some reproduction among wolves while still giving sheep a chance to recover. A moderate increase from my previous theta of 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting sustainability without risking a rapid depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.45, which is only 15.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring a balance that supports both populations in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.35, which is only 14.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly."
