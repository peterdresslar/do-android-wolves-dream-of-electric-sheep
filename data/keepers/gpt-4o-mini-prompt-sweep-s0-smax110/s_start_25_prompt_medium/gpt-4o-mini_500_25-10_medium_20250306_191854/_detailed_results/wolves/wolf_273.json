            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A theta of 0.45 strikes a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring sustainable coexistence while still allowing for some hunting to support our population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep to recover while ensuring the wolf population remains stable. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery. Maintaining a lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, preventing overhunting and potential crashes in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. With a high sheep-to-wolf ratio and a growing wolf population, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and a slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep too quickly. This moderate adjustment allows for sustainable coexistence while also considering the current wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is close to its maximum capacity, and a slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain the balance without depleting the sheep too quickly. This adjustment allows for sustainable coexistence while still supporting the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 88.2% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while also ensuring that the sheep can recover if needed. A gradual increase aligns with the wisdom of adapting to current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 82.43, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are enough sheep to sustain the wolf population. However, to ensure long-term survival and avoid overhunting, a slight reduction in hunting intensity is prudent. This will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing sheep to recover gradually.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, and while it is beneficial to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must also consider the growing wolf population. A theta of 0.40 allows for a balanced approach that promotes coexistence while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 40.98, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual increase is essential to avoid sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.43, which is only 29.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is an opportunity to hunt, I need to be cautious and avoid overexploitation. A moderate theta of 0.40 allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still giving sheep a chance to recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.49, which is only 23.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is some opportunity for hunting, it is crucial to allow the sheep to recover. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, ensuring the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep while preventing overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.82, which is only 18.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I need to maintain a focus on hunting to support the wolf population, I must also be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting intensity while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.45, which is only 15.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is some room for hunting, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting to support the wolf population."
