            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and my previous theta was too focused on hunting. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity, I can help the sheep population recover while still competing with other wolves. This gradual adjustment allows for a more sustainable balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 39.14, which is only 35.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting without risking depletion. By increasing my theta slightly from 0.25 to 0.35, I can focus on hunting while still allowing for the sheep population to recover. This moderate approach aligns with my goal of maintaining a sustainable balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 30.57, which is only 27.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I can increase my hunting intensity slightly, I must do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A small increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.50, which is only 22.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for more hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance that supports both wolf and sheep populations. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments to ensure long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.05, which is only 18.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is some room for hunting, it is crucial to avoid overexploitation to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still enabling some hunting to support our population without risking a crash in the sheep numbers.",

While I need to increase my hunting intensity slightly to support the wolf population, I must do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A theta of 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.81, which is only 13.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population. This balance is crucial for the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep.",

This indicates that there is potential for recovery if we reduce hunting intensity slightly. By increasing theta only modestly to 0.40, I can maintain a balance that allows for some hunting while also giving sheep a chance to recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and sustainable coexistence.",
