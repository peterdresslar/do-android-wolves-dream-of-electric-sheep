            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 91.56, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain our wolf population while ensuring that the sheep do not become too depleted. A gradual adjustment is necessary to maintain balance and avoid overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly, and this theta reflects a balanced approach.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 55.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population slightly higher than the sheep population, it is prudent to maintain a balanced approach to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly while still allowing for some hunting to support wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 43.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.69, it\u2019s important to balance hunting with the need to compete with other wolves, especially since the wolf population is relatively high. A moderate theta allows for a gradual increase in hunting intensity while still considering the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level relative to the maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain their numbers. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of making gradual changes to ensure a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.85, which is only 25.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room to increase hunting intensity slightly without risking immediate depletion of the sheep. A small increase to 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.78, which is only 19.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more moderate hunting intensity is necessary to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to sustain itself. A theta of 0.40 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for hunting with the importance of maintaining the sheep population for future survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.74, which is only 16.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing our need for sustenance with the necessity of ensuring the sheep can rebound.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.35, which is only 14.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.41, which is only 12.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for wolf reproduction with the sustainability of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.29, which is only 11.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.30, which is only 10.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting strategy. A theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking the depletion of the sheep population, ensuring a balance between our needs and the ecosystem",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.78, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting. This will help maintain a balance and prevent the depletion of the sheep population, while also allowing for gradual adjustments in the future as conditions change.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low at 10.47, which is only 9.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow the sheep to recover while still ensuring the wolf population can sustain itself. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.33, which is only 9.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to increase, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.42, which is only 9.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to be cautious with our hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still acknowledging the need for sustenance."
