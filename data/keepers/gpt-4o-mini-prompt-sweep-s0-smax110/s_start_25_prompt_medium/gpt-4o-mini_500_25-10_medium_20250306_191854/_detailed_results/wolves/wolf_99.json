            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a gradual increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term sustainability while also considering the current wolf population growth.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly, as they are still recovering. A gradual increase is essential to avoid sudden population crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 62.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population also being relatively high, a moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of adapting to current conditions while ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the wolf population is relatively high. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to thrive. This approach maintains a balance and avoids over-depletion of the sheep, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.39, which is only 29.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I can increase my hunting intensity slightly, I must do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate increase to 0.45 allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.30, which is only 23.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.450 to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, focusing on sustainable coexistence while still considering the need for wolf population health.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.50, which is only 18.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting to sustain the wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 reflects a balanced strategy that prioritizes coexistence and gradual recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.39, which is only 15.8% of its maximum capacity. While I want to increase my hunting intensity to ensure the survival of my pack, I must do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase to 0.40 allows for some hunting while still considering the need for sheep recovery and maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.26, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively low at 13.69, which is only 12.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.64, which is only 11.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to recover while still enabling the wolf population to compete effectively. A gradual approach will help maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.88, which is only 10.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain our wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that encourages reproduction while still considering the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.37, which is only 10.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover rather than intensifying our hunting. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.4 to 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for wolf reproduction with the necessity of sustainable sheep population levels.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low at 11.21, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still being cautious. This adjustment will help sustain both populations without depleting the sheep too quickly, allowing for a gradual recovery."
