However, with a wolf population of 5, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite high at 15.13, suggesting that I should focus on competing with other wolves to ensure our population remains stable. A theta of 0.25 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the recovery of sheep and maintaining a sustainable balance.",

However, with a wolf population of 5.00, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite high at 16.31, suggesting that I should focus on a balanced approach to avoid over-depleting the sheep while still allowing for some hunting to support wolf reproduction. A theta of 0.35 allows for a gradual increase in hunting intensity while maintaining sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 79.7% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with a wolf population of 6.00, I need to be cautious to avoid over-depleting the sheep. A gradual increase to 0.40 allows for sustainable coexistence while still promoting wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 93.85, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a sustainable balance. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to capitalize on the sheep",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is close to its maximum capacity, indicating that we should be cautious with our hunting to avoid depleting their numbers too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still being mindful of the sheep",

This adjustment allows for a gradual approach to balance both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the wolf population is relatively high.
