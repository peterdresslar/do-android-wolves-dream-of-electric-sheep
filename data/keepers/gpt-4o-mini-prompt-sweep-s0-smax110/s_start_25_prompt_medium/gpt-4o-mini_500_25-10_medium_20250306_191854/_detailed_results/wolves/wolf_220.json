            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 243\n- Sheep population: 12.29\n- Wolf population: 42.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.350\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.29 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 11.2% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight reduction in hunting intensity while still maintaining a focus on reproduction. This adjustment helps ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, as it allows the sheep population to stabilize while still supporting the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 93.3% of maximum capacity, allowing for some increased hunting intensity without risking a significant depletion of their numbers. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 91.56, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population while still considering the need for sheep recovery. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.75 reflects the need to balance hunting with the potential for sheep population growth.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 69.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with the wolf population at 58, I need to be cautious about overhunting to ensure our long-term survival. A moderate theta of 0.55 allows for a balanced approach, enabling us to hunt effectively while also allowing the sheep population to recover and maintain a sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must also be cautious of the wolf population growth. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach that supports both species without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 43.3% of its maximum capacity, which indicates that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.69, it is essential to maintain a balanced approach to ensure the long-term survival of both species. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while still enabling the wolf population to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery. A gradual increase is essential to avoid depleting the sheep population too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.85, which is only 25.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, a more moderate approach is prudent to allow for the sheep to recover. Additionally, the wolf population is relatively high at 68, so a slight reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and prevent over-depletion of the sheep, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.78, which is only 19.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I can increase my hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. A moderate increase to 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.74, which is only 16.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A theta of 0.35 reflects a moderate hunting intensity that balances our need for sustenance with the necessity of allowing the sheep to increase in number, thus ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.35, which is only 14.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that the sheep can recover if I reduce my hunting intensity slightly. By increasing theta to 0.40, I can still hunt enough to support the wolf population while allowing the sheep to stabilize and grow. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.41, which is only 12.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting without depleting the sheep further, promoting a more sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.29, which is only 11.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly."
