However, with the wolf population at 69, which is relatively high, I need to be cautious about overhunting. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while also enabling the sheep population to recover and maintain balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.50, which is only 22.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should maintain a moderate hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while still ensuring our wolf population remains healthy. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.45 will help balance our needs without depleting the sheep further.",

This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.4 to 0.35, I can maintain a focus on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring that both populations can stabilize and thrive in the long term.",

This indicates that there is potential for recovery if we reduce hunting intensity slightly. By increasing theta only moderately, I can still focus on hunting while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.78, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity.
