            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that they can sustain a higher hunting intensity without immediate risk of depletion. However, to ensure long-term balance and avoid overexploitation, I will adjust my hunting intensity moderately rather than drastically.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf reproduction and sheep recovery, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still healthy at 96.09, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that can support wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep population does not deplete too quickly. This balance helps maintain a sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support our wolf population without over-depleting the sheep, ensuring long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the sheep-to-wolf ratio being slightly above 1, I want to maintain a steady hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep population can recover. This moderate adjustment will help us avoid over-depletion of sheep and promote coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 47.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a sustainable balance. This adjustment reflects the need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy without over-depleting the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.56, which is only 28.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population and maintaining a balance with the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.70, which is only 23.4% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, a slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep too quickly. This moderate adjustment allows for sustainable coexistence while responding to the current state of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.65, which is only 18.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still being mindful of the need to compete with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.91, which is only 15.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting a lower theta, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize while still ensuring our pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.72, which is only 13.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that considers both the immediate need for food and the long-term health of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.12, which is only 11.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.4 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the long-term balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.01, which is only 10.9% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will enable me to hunt a bit more effectively while still prioritizing the long-term balance of the ecosystem."
