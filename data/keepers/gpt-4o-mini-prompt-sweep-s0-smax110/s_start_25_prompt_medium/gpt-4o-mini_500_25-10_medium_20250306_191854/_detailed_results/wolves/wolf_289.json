            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This moderate adjustment will help sustain both populations without risking depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 88.2% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 46.00, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population also being significant, I want to ensure that we do not overhunt and deplete the sheep too quickly. A gradual increase to 0.45 allows for sustainable coexistence while still supporting our pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while I want to ensure my pack thrives, I also recognize the need to allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and prevent over-depletion of the sheep, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 37.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.59, it is important to maintain a balanced approach to ensure both populations can thrive. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still supporting the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level (29.5% of maximum capacity), and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are not enough sheep to support a high hunting intensity. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting, promoting wolf reproduction while still giving sheep a chance to recover. This balance is essential for the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.49, which is only 23.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is some opportunity for hunting, it is important to maintain a balance to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.450 to 0.40 reflects a cautious approach, allowing for sustainable coexistence while still considering the need for wolf population health.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.82, which is only 18.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is some opportunity for hunting, it is crucial to maintain a balance to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate increase from my previous theta of 0.40 allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.45, which is only 15.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to allow for recovery. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.35, which is only 14.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting sustainability while still considering the need for wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.62, which is only 12.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.54, which is only 11.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population. This gradual adjustment helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be increased slightly to support wolf reproduction. However, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly, so a moderate increase is appropriate to maintain balance."
