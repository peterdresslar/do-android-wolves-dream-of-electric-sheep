            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 96.23, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This value reflects a balanced approach, enabling sustainable coexistence while still allowing for some reproduction among wolves. It also considers the current sheep-to-wolf ratio, which indicates that while hunting can be increased, it should be done gradually to avoid sudden population crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. This slight decrease from my previous theta will help ensure that the sheep can recover while still allowing for some hunting to support the wolf population. It reflects a cautious strategy that adapts to the current conditions without risking overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This balance helps maintain a sustainable ecosystem without risking a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing sustainability. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf competition and sheep recovery, ensuring long-term survival for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain the balance between wolf and sheep populations while ensuring our pack can thrive without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep too quickly. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring both populations can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, but the wolf population is slightly high. A moderate hunting intensity will allow for sustainable coexistence while giving sheep a chance to recover and ensuring that we do not over-deplete their numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because it represents a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balanced approach. The sheep population is currently at 38.7% of its maximum capacity, which allows for some hunting without risking depletion. This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.63, which is only 32.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is some opportunity for hunting, it is essential to avoid overexploitation to allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance between our population and the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 29.65, which is only 27.0% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking a significant depletion of the sheep population. A moderate increase to 0.45 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for sustainable coexistence while still considering the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.18, which is only 22.9% of its maximum capacity. While I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I need to be cautious and avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight decrease in theta allows for a balanced approach, enabling the sheep to recover while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.72, which is only 19.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I can increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. A moderate increase to 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of the wolf pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.37, which is only 17.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing competition among wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively low at 17.56, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover gradually. It"
