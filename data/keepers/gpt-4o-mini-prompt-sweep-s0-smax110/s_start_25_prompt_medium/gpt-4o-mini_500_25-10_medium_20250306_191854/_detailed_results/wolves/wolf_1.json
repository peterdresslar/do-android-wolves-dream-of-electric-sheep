            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.00, which is only 22.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased slightly to support wolf reproduction, it is essential to maintain a balance to allow the sheep population to recover. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for a gradual increase in hunting while still prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight reduction in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a balance as the wolf population grows, ensuring that both species can thrive without depleting resources too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment reflects a balance between ensuring my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while it is beneficial to maintain some hunting to support wolf reproduction, I must also be cautious not to deplete the sheep too quickly. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still ensuring the wolves can thrive."
