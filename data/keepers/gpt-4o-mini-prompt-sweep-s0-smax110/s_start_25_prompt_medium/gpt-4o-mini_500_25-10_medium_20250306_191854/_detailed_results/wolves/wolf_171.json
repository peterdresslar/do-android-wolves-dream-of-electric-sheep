            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still healthy at 83.45, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 56.00, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. This moderate intensity will help maintain the sheep population while ensuring the wolf pack can thrive. It also allows for gradual adjustments as conditions change, promoting long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicating that there are fewer sheep per wolf, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 37.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 70, I need to be cautious about overhunting. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, enabling sheep to recover while still maintaining enough hunting to support wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.56, which is only 28.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is an opportunity to hunt, I need to be cautious and avoid overexploitation. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while still giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring a sustainable balance between our populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.70, which is only 23.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring both populations can thrive.",

This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A moderate adjustment helps maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep can recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.91, which is only 15.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",

This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",

To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. This will help balance the ecosystem without depleting the sheep further.",

This indicates that we should be cautious with our hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.35, there is still a need to ensure that our wolf population remains healthy. A slight increase to 0.40 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the sustainability of both populations.",

This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our wolf population without depleting the sheep further, promoting a more balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.41, which is only 9.5% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will enable me to hunt a bit more effectively while still prioritizing the long-term balance between both populations.",
