            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 318\n- Sheep population: 11.24\n- Wolf population: 31.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.400\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.36 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 10.2% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 88.2% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will support wolf reproduction while ensuring that the sheep population does not deplete too quickly. A gradual adjustment helps maintain balance and prevents sudden crashes in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 74.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.50, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while I want to increase hunting to support wolf reproduction, I must also consider the need for the sheep to recover. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach that supports both populations without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to ensure that both populations can thrive without depleting resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level (37.3% of maximum capacity), and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are not enough sheep to support aggressive hunting. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while still competing with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 29.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.47, a slight increase in hunting intensity to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the long-term health of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.49, which is only 23.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is some opportunity for hunting, it is crucial to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.82, which is only 18.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.45, which is only 15.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling wolves to compete effectively. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance without over-depleting the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.35, which is only 14.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that I can afford to increase my hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A gradual increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, ensuring that I do not over-exploit the sheep while also considering the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.62, which is only 12.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while we need to hunt to sustain our population, we should not overexert ourselves to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a more balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still acknowledging the need for hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.54, which is only 11.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our wolf population. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity, giving sheep a chance to increase their numbers, while still allowing for some hunting to sustain our pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.71, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting without risking depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.24, which is only 10.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack while also prioritizing the long-term balance of the ecosystem."
