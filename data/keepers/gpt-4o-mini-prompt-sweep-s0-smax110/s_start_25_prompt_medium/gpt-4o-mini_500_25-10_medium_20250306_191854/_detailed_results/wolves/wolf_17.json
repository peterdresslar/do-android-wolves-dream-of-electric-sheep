            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 93.35, allowing for some increased hunting intensity without risking a significant depletion of their numbers. This adjustment supports our reproductive needs while still considering the sustainability of the ecosystem. A gradual decrease from my previous theta of 0.955 helps maintain balance as the wolf population grows.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 95.26, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help support wolf reproduction while ensuring that the sheep population does not decline too rapidly. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance and avoid overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 88.0% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This balance will help sustain both the wolf and sheep populations while allowing for gradual adjustments as conditions change.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This balance helps maintain both populations sustainably without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. This will help maintain a sustainable coexistence while also considering the gradual increase in wolf numbers. A slight reduction from my previous theta will help ensure that we do not deplete the sheep too quickly, allowing for future hunting opportunities.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This approach helps maintain a sustainable balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because it represents a balanced approach to hunting. The sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for some hunting without risking depletion. This moderate intensity will help sustain both the sheep and wolf populations while adapting to the current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This approach helps maintain a balance between our populations, avoiding overhunting and allowing for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the balance between wolves and sheep. This adjustment will help maintain the wolf population without over-depleting the sheep, ensuring sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring both populations can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level (38.7% of maximum capacity), and while I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.63, which is only 32.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is some room for hunting, we must be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a moderate hunting intensity that can help sustain both populations while still being mindful of the wolf population growth.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 29.65, which is only 27.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for sustainable coexistence while being cautious about overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.18, which is only 22.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done gradually to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate increase to 0.45 allows for some hunting while still considering the need for sheep recovery and the overall balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.72, which is only 19.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By lowering my hunting intensity slightly, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some sustainable hunting. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.37, which is only 17.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A gradual increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, considering both the need for wolves to thrive and the importance of not depleting the sheep too quickly."
