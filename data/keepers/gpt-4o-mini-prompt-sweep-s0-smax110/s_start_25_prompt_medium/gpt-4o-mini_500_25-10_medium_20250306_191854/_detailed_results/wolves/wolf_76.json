This moderate approach will help maintain a sustainable balance.",

A slight increase from my previous theta reflects a balanced approach, allowing for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both sheep and wolves.",

To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover and maintain a sustainable balance. This lower theta will help prevent overexploitation of the sheep while still allowing for some competition among wolves.",

Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover and ensures the long-term survival of both species. Additionally, with the wolf population at 27, it",

Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to recover and ensuring long-term sustainability for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderate to allow for recovery while still ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",

This adjustment reflects a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. It also considers the need to adapt to the growing wolf population.",
