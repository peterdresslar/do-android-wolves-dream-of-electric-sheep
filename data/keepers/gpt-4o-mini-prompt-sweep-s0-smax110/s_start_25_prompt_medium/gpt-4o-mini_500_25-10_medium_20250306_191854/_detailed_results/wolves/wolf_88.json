            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 89\n- Sheep population: 109.26\n- Wolf population: 34.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.474\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 3.21 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 99.3% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that we should be cautious with our hunting to avoid depleting their numbers too quickly. A slight reduction from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring that both sheep and wolves can thrive in the long term while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is close to its maximum capacity, and while it is important to maintain a healthy wolf population, I need to be cautious about overhunting. A slight decrease in hunting intensity allows for sheep recovery while still enabling wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 95.31, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while ensuring we do not over-deplete their numbers. This moderate adjustment reflects a balance between maintaining our wolf population and allowing the sheep to recover, aligning with the wisdom of gradual changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, but I need to be cautious about the wolf population growth. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover further while still enabling us to maintain a sustainable balance. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments to ensure long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 62.5% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment helps maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can recover. It aligns with the wisdom of making gradual changes to adapt to the current ecosystem state.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, and while it is beneficial to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must also consider the growing wolf population. A theta of 0.40 allows for a balanced approach that promotes coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 38.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting, which could lead to a depletion of sheep. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on maintaining balance and ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 29.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.47, it is wise to focus on competition with other wolves to allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a sustainable balance. A gradual adjustment towards lower hunting intensity will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.30, which is only 23.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.50, which is only 18.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased slightly, a more moderate approach is necessary to allow the sheep to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.39, which is only 15.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support our reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.26, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population and maintaining a balance with the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we need to be cautious in our hunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a bit more hunting to support wolf reproduction while still being mindful of the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.64, which is only 11.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should be cautious with our hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 to 0.35 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for some hunting while prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both populations. This adjustment also considers the growing wolf population, which requires a careful balance to avoid over-depletion of our prey."
