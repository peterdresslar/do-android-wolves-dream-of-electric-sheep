            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 95.31, allowing for some increased hunting intensity without risking depletion. However, I want to avoid over-hunting as the wolf population is also significant at 47.00. This moderate increase in theta will help maintain a balance while still allowing for reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while it is beneficial to maintain some hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must also consider the potential for over-depletion of the sheep. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring both populations can thrive without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring long-term sustainability for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 38.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. However, with a wolf population of 69, it is wise to maintain a moderate hunting intensity to ensure that both populations can thrive without depleting the sheep too quickly. This balance allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level relative to the maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to sustain itself. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.30, which is only 23.0% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity slightly while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population. This moderate approach will help the sheep recover while preventing overcompetition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.50, which is only 18.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased slightly to support wolf reproduction, it is essential to do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A gradual increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.39, which is only 15.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring a balance that promotes both wolf and sheep survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.69, which is only 12.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining some hunting to support our wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing our need for food with the necessity of ensuring the sheep can rebound.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.64, which is only 11.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room to increase hunting intensity slightly without risking immediate depletion. However, since the wolf population is relatively high at 39, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A small increase to 0.40 allows for sustainable hunting while still considering the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.88, which is only 10.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.400 to 0.35, I can maintain a focus on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.37, which is only 10.3% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and avoid depleting their numbers further, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting intensively. This approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
