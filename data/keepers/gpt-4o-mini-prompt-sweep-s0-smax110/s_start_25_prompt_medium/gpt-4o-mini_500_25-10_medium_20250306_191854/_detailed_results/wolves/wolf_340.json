            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A balanced approach will help sustain both the sheep and wolf populations, preventing depletion while still allowing for some hunting.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that we should be cautious with our hunting to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance while still allowing for some hunting, as the wolf population is relatively stable. This approach supports both our survival and the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. With a high sheep-to-wolf ratio, focusing on competition with other wolves will help maintain a sustainable balance without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be cautiously increased to prevent over-depletion. However, with the wolf population also present, a moderate approach is necessary to ensure we do not overhunt and create a crash in the sheep population. This small increase from my previous theta allows for a gradual adaptation to the current conditions while still prioritizing long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. A moderate increase to 0.4 will help maintain a balance between wolf reproduction and sheep recovery, ensuring both populations can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment helps maintain a balance between ensuring wolf reproduction and allowing the sheep population to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 94.71, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are enough sheep to support a moderate hunting intensity. By slightly lowering my theta from 0.450 to 0.40, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, which will help maintain a balance and prevent over-depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain the balance between wolf and sheep populations while ensuring that we do not over-deplete the sheep. A gradual increase aligns with the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and supports the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while it is beneficial to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must remain cautious to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A moderate adjustment allows for a balance that supports both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, and while it is beneficial to increase hunting slightly as the sheep population is above 50, I must also consider the growing wolf population. A small decrease in hunting intensity will allow for a more sustainable balance, ensuring that both sheep and wolves can thrive in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 39.14, which is only 35.6% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep too quickly. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.35 helps maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 30.57, which is only 27.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.50, which is only 22.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for a slight increase in hunting intensity to help sustain wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A gradual increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, considering both the need for wolves to thrive and the importance of not depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.05, which is only 18.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By slightly lowering my hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
