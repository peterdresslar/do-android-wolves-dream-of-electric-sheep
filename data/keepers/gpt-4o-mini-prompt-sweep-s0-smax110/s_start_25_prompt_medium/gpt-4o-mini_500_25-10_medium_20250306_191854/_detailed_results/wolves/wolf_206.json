            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution in hunting to prevent depletion. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, enabling the sheep to recover while still ensuring the wolf population can thrive. This adjustment reflects the need to adapt to the current high sheep numbers and the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover and maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem. This approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at its maximum capacity, and maintaining a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover and prevent overexploitation. This approach supports the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",

Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that they can sustain a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. A moderate increase to 0.40 allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still considering the need for balance and the potential for future growth in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 93.3% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 91.56, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to ensure sustainable coexistence, as the sheep population is not yet at risk of depletion.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term health of both the sheep and wolf populations. This moderate adjustment helps maintain balance as the wolf population is slightly high, and it allows for recovery of sheep without risking overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 43.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to prevent a crash in the sheep population. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for more hunting while still considering the long-term balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while it is beneficial to maintain some hunting to support wolf reproduction, I need to be cautious given the relatively high wolf population. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will help ensure that both populations can thrive without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.85, which is only 25.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for more hunting to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious to avoid over-exploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.78, which is only 19.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is an opportunity to hunt, I need to be cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight reduction from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still enabling some hunting to support our population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.74, which is only 16.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for sustenance with the long-term health of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.35, which is only 14.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly.
