            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and my previous theta was too low for effective hunting. However, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting, so I will gradually increase my hunting intensity to allow for some recovery of the sheep population while still competing with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and hunting more aggressively could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively low. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover and ensures that we do not deplete their numbers too quickly. This approach will help sustain both populations in the long run.",

Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover and ensures that our wolf population can thrive in the long run without risking a crash in the ecosystem.",

Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover. This balanced approach supports long-term sustainability for both populations.",

This approach helps maintain a sustainable balance while also considering the current wolf population, which is growing. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for cautious adaptation to the changing conditions.",
