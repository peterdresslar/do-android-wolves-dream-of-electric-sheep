            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help ensure the wolf population remains healthy without depleting the sheep too quickly, promoting long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 42.59, which is only 38.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I can increase my hunting intensity, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight decrease in theta allows for a balanced approach, enabling the sheep to recover while still allowing for some hunting to support the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 32.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 57.00, it"
