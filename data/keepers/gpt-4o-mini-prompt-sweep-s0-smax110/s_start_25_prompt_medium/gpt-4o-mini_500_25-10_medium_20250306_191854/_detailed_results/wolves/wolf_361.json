            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 375\n- Sheep population: 94.71\n- Wolf population: 47.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.348\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 2.02 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 86.1% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 94.71, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and maintain their numbers. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term survival of both species. This moderate adjustment will help maintain balance as the sheep population is recovering, while also considering the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking their depletion. This adjustment reflects the need to balance the growing wolf population while still ensuring the sheep can recover and thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term survival of both species. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to ensure that the sheep can recover while also allowing the wolf population to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.44, it indicates that we need to be cautious about overhunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still promoting the recovery of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.50, which is only 22.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some reproduction among wolves while still giving sheep a chance to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, ensuring that we do not deplete the sheep population too quickly while also considering the growth of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.05, which is only 18.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I need to focus on hunting to support the wolf population, I must also be cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight reduction in hunting intensity allows for some recovery of the sheep while still enabling the wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.08, which is only 15.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.81, which is only 13.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need to compete with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to sustain our population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.41, which is only 12.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the immediate needs of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.30, which is only 11.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing our need for sustenance with the long-term health of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.65, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting to support the wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach that promotes coexistence without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.11, which is only 10.1% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity slightly while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population. This moderate approach will help the sheep recover while also considering the growing wolf population."
