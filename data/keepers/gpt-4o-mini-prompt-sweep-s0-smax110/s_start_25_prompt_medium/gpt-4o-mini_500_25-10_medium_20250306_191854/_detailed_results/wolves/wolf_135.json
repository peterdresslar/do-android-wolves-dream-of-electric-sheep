This lower theta will help maintain a balance between competing wolves and the sheep population, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",

This approach supports the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition with other wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term balance in the ecosystem.",

Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition with other wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be cautiously increased to prevent over-depletion. However, since the wolf population is relatively stable, a moderate increase in hunting intensity allows for a gradual adjustment while still considering the long-term sustainability of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover and prevent overexploitation. This moderate approach will help maintain a sustainable balance.",

This approach will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is close to its maximum capacity, indicating that we can increase our hunting intensity slightly without risking depletion. A moderate increase allows for sustainable coexistence while still supporting our wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to maintain balance, considering the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need for sustainable coexistence.",

The sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and with the sheep-to-wolf ratio being slightly above 1, I can afford to maintain a moderate hunting intensity. This will allow for some reproduction among wolves while ensuring that the sheep population does not deplete too quickly. Gradually adjusting to 0.5 helps maintain a dynamic balance as both populations fluctuate.",

However, with the wolf population at 69, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring that both populations can thrive without leading to a crash.",

This adjustment reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for wolf reproduction with the necessity of not depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.56, which is only 28.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
