However, with the wolf population at 55, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both populations can thrive. A gradual increase in hunting intensity will help balance the ecosystem without risking a crash.",

A slight increase from my previous theta allows for more hunting while still considering the need for balance as the wolf population is also significant. This adjustment aims to promote coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",

A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help ensure that the sheep can grow in numbers while also allowing the wolf population to stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.18, which is only 22.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.72, which is only 19.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for some hunting without depleting the sheep further.",
