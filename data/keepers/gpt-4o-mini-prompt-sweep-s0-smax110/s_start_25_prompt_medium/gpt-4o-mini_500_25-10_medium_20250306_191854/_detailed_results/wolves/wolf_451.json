            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help support wolf reproduction while still enabling the sheep population to recover. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need to avoid sudden changes, a gradual adjustment is the best approach.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level (27.8% of maximum capacity), and while it is important to increase hunting to support wolf reproduction, I must also be cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, enabling sustainable coexistence while still addressing the needs of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.55, which is only 22.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is some room for hunting, I need to be cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, enabling me to maintain a healthy wolf population while also giving the sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.12, which is only 18.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus more on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.16, which is only 15.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for more hunting intensity while still being cautious, as the wolf population is relatively high at 54. I aim to balance the needs of both populations and ensure long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.04, which is only 13.7% of its maximum capacity.
