            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 244\n- Sheep population: 11.30\n- Wolf population: 37.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.400\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.31 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 10.3% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still healthy at 102.66, which allows for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 40.00, I need to be cautious not to overhunt and risk depleting the sheep too quickly. A theta of 0.80 strikes a balance between ensuring my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 91.56, allowing for some increased hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 49.00, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while preventing over-depletion of the sheep. This balance will help maintain both populations in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 55.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population slightly higher than the sheep population, I need to focus on maintaining balance and preventing overhunting. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while also considering the need for sheep recovery and the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the wolf population is relatively high. A slight decrease in hunting intensity allows for better competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover. This approach supports long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. It",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.85, which is only 25.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for the sheep to recover, and a lower hunting intensity will allow for that recovery while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. Gradually reducing hunting intensity will help balance the ecosystem and avoid depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively low at 21.78, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring both can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.74, which is only 16.1% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing competition with other wolves. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting without depleting the sheep population too quickly, maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.35, which is only 14.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is an opportunity to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A gradual increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach that considers both the current low sheep numbers and the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.41, which is only 12.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to allow the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our strength.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.29, which is only 11.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support our wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting sustainability while still considering the need to compete with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.30, which is only 10.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting to sustain the wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 reflects a balanced strategy, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting."
