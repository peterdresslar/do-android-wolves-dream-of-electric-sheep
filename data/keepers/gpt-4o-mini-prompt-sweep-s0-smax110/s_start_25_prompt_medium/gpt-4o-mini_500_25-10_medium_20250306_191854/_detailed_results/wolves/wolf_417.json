            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A theta of 0.45 strikes a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainable coexistence while preventing over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and while I want to ensure the wolves can thrive, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and prevent over-depletion of the sheep, ensuring long-term sustainability for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively healthy at 93.7% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 41, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 84.3% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balanced approach. This will help ensure the sustainability of both sheep and wolf populations as I adapt to the current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and a slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain our wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. This adjustment allows for a gradual response to the current conditions while keeping an eye on the long-term balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term health of both populations. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to ensure that the sheep can recover and that the wolf population remains stable.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, and while it is beneficial to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must also consider the growing wolf population. A theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach that supports both species without risking a rapid decline in sheep numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 35.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both populations can thrive. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 30.56, which is only 27.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.55, which is only 22.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support our wolf population without risking a significant decline in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.12, which is only 18.3% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will enable me to hunt more effectively while still prioritizing the sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.16, which is only 15.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without jeopardizing the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.04, which is only 13.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help balance the need for hunting with the goal of not depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.60, which is only 12.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting to sustain the wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for a balance between competing with other wolves and hunting, ensuring long-term survival for both species."
