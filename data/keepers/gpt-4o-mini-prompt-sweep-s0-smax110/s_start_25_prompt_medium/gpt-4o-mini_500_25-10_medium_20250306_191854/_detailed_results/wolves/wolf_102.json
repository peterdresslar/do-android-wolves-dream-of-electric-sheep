However, I want to avoid overhunting, so a moderate increase from my previous theta of 0.876 to 0.75 allows for sustainable coexistence while still supporting wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing sheep to recover. A gradual approach is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. While the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a slight competition for resources, maintaining a moderate hunting intensity will help ensure the long-term survival of both populations. This adjustment allows for gradual hunting while still considering the need for wolf population health.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 49.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 67, which is relatively high, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A moderate theta of 0.55 allows for a balanced approach, enabling me to maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight reduction in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a balance between the wolf and sheep populations while still allowing for some hunting to support wolf reproduction. It is important to avoid overhunting as the sheep population is still recovering.",

However, with the wolf population at 69, I need to be cautious about overhunting. A slight decrease in hunting intensity allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves.",

This suggests that while I need to maintain some hunting to support wolf reproduction, I should focus on a balanced approach to allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease from my previous theta of 0.450 will help ensure sustainable coexistence and prevent over-depletion of the sheep population.",

While I want to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I also recognize the need for the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing competition with other wolves, promoting a sustainable balance.",

This suggests that while I need to maintain some hunting to support the wolf population, I should also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 to 0.40 reflects a cautious approach to hunting, balancing the need for sustenance with the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.26, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to recover. Additionally, with a wolf population of 50, it",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.64, which is only 11.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain my pack",
