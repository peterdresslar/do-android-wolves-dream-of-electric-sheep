            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level relative to its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. A moderate decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain its health. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of balancing competition and hunting to ensure long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 29.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both populations can thrive. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.49, which is only 23.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.4 to 0.35, I can focus on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring a balance that supports both species in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.82, which is only 18.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species."
