            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while it is beneficial to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must also be cautious to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A moderate increase allows for a balanced approach, ensuring both populations can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment reflects a balanced approach to ensure both wolf and sheep populations can thrive together. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio, a gradual increase in hunting will help sustain our pack while still allowing the sheep to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 37.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 69, which is relatively high, I need to be cautious about overhunting. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain a healthy population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 29.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.47, it is important to focus on a balanced approach to ensure the sheep can recover while also allowing for some hunting to maintain our wolf population. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help us adapt to the growing wolf population and prevent over-depletion of sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.49, which is only 23.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting sustainability without risking a rapid depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.82, which is only 18.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for the sheep to recover. By setting theta to 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This gradual adjustment helps maintain a balance between hunting and competition, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the wolf population is relatively high. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain our population while allowing the sheep to recover.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.35, which is only 14.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, reducing hunting intensity while still enabling some reproduction among wolves.",

A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the immediate needs of the pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.54, which is only 11.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate increase to 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population and maintaining a balance with the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.71, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.81, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population.

By slightly increasing my theta from 0.4 to 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, promoting a balance that supports both populations in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep further.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.69, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A moderate increase from my previous theta of 0.40 helps maintain a balance as the sheep population can recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.12, which is only 11.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to ensure our own survival. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for food with the necessity of sustaining both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.67, which is only 11.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is potential for recovery in the sheep population. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity to 0.40, I can take advantage of the current sheep numbers while still allowing for their growth.
