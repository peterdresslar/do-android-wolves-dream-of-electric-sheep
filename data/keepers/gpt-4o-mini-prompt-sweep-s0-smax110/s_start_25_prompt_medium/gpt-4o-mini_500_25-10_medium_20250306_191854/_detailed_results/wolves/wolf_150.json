            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that they are vulnerable to overhunting. A moderate hunting intensity will allow for some reproduction among wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover. This balance is crucial to ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that a more moderate hunting intensity is necessary to prevent depletion. This value allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while ensuring that the sheep population can recover and maintain balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is close to its maximum capacity, indicating that we should maintain a balanced approach to hunting. This will allow for sustainable coexistence while still supporting our wolf population. A slight reduction from my previous theta will help prevent overhunting and ensure that both populations can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 96.09, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This value reflects a balanced approach, considering the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need to avoid overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 83.45, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a sustainable coexistence as we adapt to the current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term survival of both species. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to ensure that the sheep can recover while also allowing the wolf population to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still considering the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.56, which is only 28.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 will help us compete with other wolves without overhunting the sheep, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.70, which is only 23.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.35 to 0.40, I can help ensure the wolf population remains healthy while still allowing the sheep to recover over time. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.65, which is only 18.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still being mindful of the need to avoid overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.91, which is only 15.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both populations. It also accounts for the growing wolf population, which suggests a need to balance competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.72, which is only 13.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.12, which is only 11.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach that prioritizes competition among wolves while still enabling some hunting, ensuring the long-term survival of both species."
