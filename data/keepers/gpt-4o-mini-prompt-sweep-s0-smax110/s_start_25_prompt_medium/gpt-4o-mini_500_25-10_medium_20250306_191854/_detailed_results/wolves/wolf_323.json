            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 40.98, which is only 37.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A lower theta will help maintain a balance, ensuring that both populations can thrive without depleting resources too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.43, which is only 29.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is some opportunity for hunting, it is crucial to maintain a balance to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while also focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.49, which is only 23.2% of its maximum capacity. While I need to focus on hunting to support my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.82, which is only 18.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without risking depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for more effective hunting while still being cautious about the overall balance, as the wolf population is relatively high. This approach aims to ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.45, which is only 15.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should prioritize allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach that can help sustain both populations without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.35, which is only 14.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.62, which is only 12.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a slight increase in hunting compared to my previous value, acknowledging the need for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the sustainability of the sheep population.",
