            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 244\n- Sheep population: 11.30\n- Wolf population: 37.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.400\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.31 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 10.3% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 93.3% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover if needed. A gradual approach is essential to maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 91.56, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that can support wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This value reflects a balanced approach, considering the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need to avoid over-depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity while still ensuring their recovery. This balance helps maintain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly, aligning with the wisdom of gradual adjustments.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term health of both sheep and wolves. This moderate adjustment will help maintain balance as the wolf population is slightly high, and it allows for gradual adaptation to changing conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still considering the long-term health of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 32.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for gradual hunting without risking depletion. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.52, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.85, which is only 25.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly, as I need to consider both the current state and the trends in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.78, which is only 19.8% of its maximum capacity. While I want to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I also recognize the need to allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, allowing both populations to stabilize without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.74, which is only 16.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from the previous theta of 0.40 to 0.35, I can still maintain a balance that allows for some hunting while prioritizing the long-term survival of both species. This moderate adjustment reflects the need to adapt to the current conditions without risking a crash in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.35, which is only 14.0% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will enable me to hunt more effectively, but I will do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.41, which is only 12.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring that the sheep population can gradually increase without depleting their numbers too quickly. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.29, which is only 11.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.30, which is only 10.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing our need for sustenance with the long-term survival of both species."
