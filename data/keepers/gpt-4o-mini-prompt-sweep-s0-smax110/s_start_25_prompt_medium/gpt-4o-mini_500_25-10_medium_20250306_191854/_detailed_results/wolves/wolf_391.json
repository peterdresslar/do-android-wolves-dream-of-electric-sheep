            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that we should not intensify hunting further. A moderate approach will allow for some hunting while giving the sheep a chance to recover and maintain a sustainable balance. This will help ensure the long-term survival of both our pack and the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. With a high sheep-to-wolf ratio, focusing on competition with other wolves will help maintain our population without depleting the sheep further. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and while I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the balance of the ecosystem.",

This adjustment reflects a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover if needed.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 84.3% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a sustainable coexistence as both populations fluctuate.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction without risking the sheep population too much, as it is still recovering. A gradual increase is prudent to ensure sustainability.",

With a wolf population of 69, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is low, suggesting that a more moderate approach to hunting will allow sheep to stabilize while also preventing overcompetition among wolves. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 30.56, which is only 27.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain our population without depleting the sheep too quickly.
