            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 103\n- Sheep population: 11.88\n- Wolf population: 35.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.400\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.34 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 10.8% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and while I want to maintain a healthy wolf population, I also need to ensure that the sheep do not become overhunted. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will allow for some reproduction among wolves while still giving sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 95.31, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while maintaining a sustainable balance. This adjustment will support wolf reproduction without significantly depleting the sheep population, ensuring long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the sheep population at 74.9% of its maximum capacity, I can maintain a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This adjustment allows for a dynamic balance between competing with other wolves and hunting, promoting long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term health of both populations. This adjustment reflects a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring that the sheep can recover, as they are still below maximum capacity.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 49.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. Given that the wolf population is relatively high at 67, I want to focus on maintaining a balance that allows the sheep to recover while still ensuring the wolves can thrive. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help prevent over-depletion of the sheep while allowing for some competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment reflects the need to balance our growing wolf population while still ensuring the sheep can recover and thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 29.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.47, it is essential to maintain a balance that allows for the sheep to recover while also ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help sustain both populations without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.30, which is only 23.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining some hunting to support the wolf population. A theta of 0.35 allows for a slight focus on competition with other wolves while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.50, which is only 18.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of the wolf pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.39, which is only 15.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it is crucial to do so gradually to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate increase to 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population and maintaining a balance with the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.26, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the immediate needs of the pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.69, which is only 12.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting without risking a further decline in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.64, which is only 11.5% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking the depletion of the sheep population. A theta of 0.40 represents a moderate approach that balances the need for wolf reproduction with the sustainability of the sheep population, allowing for gradual adjustments as conditions change.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.88, which is only 10.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.400 to 0.35, I can maintain a balance that focuses on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring the long-term survival of both species."
