            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 303\n- Sheep population: 109.57\n- Wolf population: 33.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.463\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 3.32 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 99.6% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. A lower theta allows for a focus on competition among wolves, which can help manage our numbers while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a sustainable balance. This adjustment will help support the wolf population without risking a rapid depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 88.2% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while maintaining a sustainable balance with the sheep population. It reflects a cautious approach to ensure long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 82.43, allowing for a moderate hunting approach. This will help maintain a balance between the wolf and sheep populations while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.50, a slight reduction in hunting intensity will support the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and I want to maintain a balance that allows for both wolf reproduction and sheep recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta reflects the need to adapt to the growing sheep population while avoiding overhunting, which could lead to future scarcity.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for some hunting without risking depletion. Given the wolf population is also relatively high, a slight reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and allow both populations to stabilize. This approach aligns with the wisdom of making gradual adjustments to ensure long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still considering the long-term health of the sheep population. A gradual increase is prudent given the current dynamics.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 29.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.47, it is essential to maintain a balance that allows for sustainable coexistence. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help the sheep recover while also considering the growing wolf population. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of making gradual changes to ensure long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.49, which is only 23.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own wolf population. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance and prevent over-depletion of sheep, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.82, which is only 18.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is potential for recovery if I reduce hunting intensity slightly. By increasing theta to 0.40, I can still maintain a focus on hunting while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow, ensuring a sustainable balance between both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.45, which is only 15.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is a need for hunting to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A slight reduction in hunting intensity allows for some recovery of the sheep population while still enabling wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.35, which is only 14.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some reproduction among wolves while still giving sheep a chance to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.62, which is only 12.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting to sustain the wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for a balance between competing with other wolves and hunting, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.54, which is only 11.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still recognizing the need to hunt."
