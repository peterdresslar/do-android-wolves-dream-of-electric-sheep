            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that they are abundant. However, with a wolf population of 7, I need to ensure that we do not overhunt and deplete the sheep too quickly. A moderate hunting intensity allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at its maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A moderate theta value will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can stabilize, promoting long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. A lower theta will help balance competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to stabilize, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. With a high sheep-to-wolf ratio and a growing wolf population, it is wise to focus on competition among wolves rather than aggressive hunting, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover while also keeping the wolf population stable. This balance is crucial for the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery. Maintaining the current theta helps prevent over-depletion of sheep while ensuring the wolf population can stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at maximum capacity, and maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover and prevents overexploitation. This approach also helps to stabilize the wolf population by reducing competition among wolves, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",

With a high sheep-to-wolf ratio, focusing on competition with other wolves will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. This gradual approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",

Maintaining a lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that they can sustain a slight increase in hunting intensity without causing immediate harm. A moderate increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the long-term health of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high at 103.02, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sustainable coexistence. A gradual increase helps maintain balance as both populations evolve.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 84.3% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that can support wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This approach balances the needs of both populations and avoids over-depletion of sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 72.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for more hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance that supports both wolf and sheep populations. This approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while it is beneficial to increase hunting intensity slightly, I must remain cautious to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A moderate approach allows for coexistence while still enabling the wolf population to thrive.",

However, with the wolf population at 69, it is wise to maintain a moderate hunting intensity to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly while still allowing for some growth in the wolf population. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 30.56, which is only 27.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is some opportunity for hunting, it is crucial to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.4 to 0.35, I can maintain a balanced approach that supports both the wolf population and the sheep",
