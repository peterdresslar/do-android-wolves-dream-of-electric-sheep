            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 42.10, which is only 38.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is some opportunity for hunting, it is crucial to prioritize the recovery of the sheep population to ensure long-term sustainability. A gradual increase in theta allows for a balanced approach, reducing competition with other wolves while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.39, which is only 29.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate increase to 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and adapting to the current state of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.30, which is only 23.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.50, which is only 18.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking the depletion of the sheep population, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.39, which is only 15.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase to 0.40 allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.26, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 reflects a balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to support reproduction.",
