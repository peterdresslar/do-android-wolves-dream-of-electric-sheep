A theta of 0.45 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for some hunting while also considering the need to maintain sheep numbers for future sustainability. This adjustment will help prevent over-depletion of the sheep population and support the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep.",

A lower theta will help maintain a balance between our population and the sheep, ensuring long-term survival for both species. This gradual adjustment will also help prevent overexploitation of the sheep.",

A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a potential overhunting risk. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing competition with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to depletion of their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that a slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted to maintain balance. However, given the current wolf population and the need to avoid over-depleting the sheep, a gradual increase is more prudent than a drastic change.",
