However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 2.07, it is essential to focus on reducing competition among wolves while allowing sheep to recover. A gradual increase in theta will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep population too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term health of both species. This moderate adjustment helps maintain balance as the sheep population is recovering, while also considering the growing wolf population.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery. A gradual increase helps maintain balance and avoids sudden shifts that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 38.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population being relatively high, a slight reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and allow both populations to thrive without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing sheep to recover gradually.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and while it is important to maintain a healthy wolf population, I need to ensure that the sheep have the opportunity to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help balance the ecosystem and allow for sustainable coexistence.",

This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting sustainability while still considering the need to compete with other wolves as their numbers grow.",

To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity slightly to allow the sheep to recover while still competing with other wolves. This moderate approach will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem.",

This indicates that we need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep population while also being mindful of our own wolf numbers. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our needs without over-depleting the sheep, fostering a more balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.48, which is only 15.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase to 0.40 allows for some hunting while still focusing on the competition with other wolves, ensuring a balance that promotes long-term survival for both species.",
