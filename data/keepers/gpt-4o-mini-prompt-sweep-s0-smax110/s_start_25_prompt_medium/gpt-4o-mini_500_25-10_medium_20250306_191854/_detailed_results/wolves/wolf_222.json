            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 244\n- Sheep population: 11.30\n- Wolf population: 37.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.400\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.31 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 10.3% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and while I want to maintain a healthy wolf population, I also need to ensure that the sheep can recover. A moderate hunting intensity allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 93.3% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that can support wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This balance helps maintain a sustainable ecosystem without risking a rapid decline in sheep numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we can afford to maintain a moderate hunting intensity. This allows for sustainable coexistence while also considering the gradual increase in wolf numbers. A small adjustment down from my previous theta will help balance our needs with the recovery of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 69.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, the wolf population is also significant, so a moderate increase in hunting intensity will help sustain our pack without depleting the sheep too quickly. This adjustment allows for a balanced approach that supports both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the sheep-to-wolf ratio being close to 1, I want to ensure that we do not overhunt and deplete their numbers too quickly. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain a sustainable balance while still allowing for some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 43.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.69, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term survival of both species. This moderate adjustment helps maintain balance as the wolf population is relatively high, and it allows for gradual adaptation to the changing conditions without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.85, which is only 25.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still enabling some hunting to support our population growth.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.78, which is only 19.8% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A moderate increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.74, which is only 16.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring a balance that supports both populations in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.35, which is only 14.0% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I also want to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a bit more hunting intensity while still prioritizing balance and sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.41, which is only 12.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, reducing hunting intensity while still competing with other wolves. This will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.29, which is only 11.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting without risking depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, enabling me to take advantage of the sheep population while still considering the long-term health of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.30, which is only 10.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting a theta of 0.35, I can focus more on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This gradual adjustment helps maintain a balance between hunting and competition, ensuring the long-term survival of both species."
