However, with the wolf population at 68, which is relatively high, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting to support wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and while it is important to maintain a balance, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta will help sustain my pack while still being cautious about overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.43, which is only 29.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.49, which is only 23.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.35, I can focus more on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.82, which is only 18.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to help sustain our wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly.
