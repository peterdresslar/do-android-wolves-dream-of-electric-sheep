            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that a more balanced approach is necessary to prevent overhunting. A moderate theta allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some hunting to support the wolf population. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a healthy balance between both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still healthy at 93.7% of maximum capacity, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 2.51, I can maintain a sustainable coexistence while ensuring the wolf population remains stable. This moderate adjustment allows for gradual hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 84.3% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate hunting approach. This will help maintain a balance between the wolf and sheep populations while avoiding overexploitation. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.89, a slight decrease in hunting intensity will also help support the growing wolf population without risking the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, but with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.40, it indicates that while there are enough sheep to sustain us, we should not overhunt. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a more cautious approach, ensuring that both populations can thrive without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain the balance between wolf and sheep populations while ensuring our pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while it is beneficial to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep too quickly. A moderate adjustment allows for a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring both populations can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 39.29, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious. This adjustment helps maintain a balance, ensuring that we do not deplete the sheep population too quickly while also considering the growing wolf numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 30.56, which is only 27.8% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.55, which is only 22.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 allows for a more balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.12, which is only 18.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while I need to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.16, which is only 15.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for sustainable hunting without risking depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach to hunting while still considering the need for coexistence and the potential for sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.04, which is only 13.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I need to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.57, which is only 11.4% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population.
