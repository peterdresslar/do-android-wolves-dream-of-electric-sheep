To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition with other wolves. A gradual increase in theta will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This approach will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem and ensure the long-term survival of both species.",

Maintaining a lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, preventing overhunting and potential crashes in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. This lower hunting intensity will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that a slight increase in hunting intensity is appropriate to maintain balance. However, I must be cautious and avoid overhunting, as the wolf population is still relatively low. A gradual increase allows for sustainable coexistence while still addressing the needs of my pack.",

A slight reduction from my previous theta allows for a more cautious approach, ensuring that we do not deplete the sheep population too quickly while still allowing for some hunting to support our reproduction.",

This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still considering the long-term survival of both species.",

However, the wolf population is relatively high, so a slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. This moderate approach helps ensure long-term sustainability.",

However, with the wolf population at 69, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure our long-term survival.
