            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 81.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 6.91, it is crucial to focus on competition among wolves to prevent overhunting and allow the sheep population to recover. A gradual increase in theta will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a sustainable balance. This adjustment will help support the wolf population without over-depleting the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 95.26, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while maintaining a sustainable balance. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to capitalize on the current sheep abundance without risking over-depletion, ensuring both wolf and sheep populations can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because it represents a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balanced approach. The sheep population is relatively high at 96.77, allowing for some increased hunting without risking depletion. This adjustment also considers the growing wolf population, ensuring we can sustain ourselves while allowing sheep to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 87.5% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate hunting approach. This will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population does not decline too rapidly. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach as the wolf population is stable, promoting coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 89.16, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity. This will help maintain a balance between the wolf and sheep populations while preventing overhunting. As the sheep population is at 81.1% of its maximum capacity, a slight reduction in hunting intensity will support the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring our long-term survival while still allowing for some growth in our pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can continue to thrive. A gradual adjustment is key to avoiding depletion and ensuring long-term balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate hunting approach. This will help maintain a balance between the wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term sustainability while still allowing for some hunting to support our pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for some hunting without risking depletion. A slight decrease from my previous theta reflects the need to balance competition with other wolves while still allowing for sustainable hunting. This adjustment will help maintain both populations in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term survival of both species. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to ensure that the sheep can recover while we maintain a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.63, which is only 32.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is room for some hunting to support wolf reproduction, we must be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 29.65, which is only 27.0% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and support the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.18, which is only 22.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A small increase from my previous theta of 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.72, which is only 19.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more conservative approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some sustainable hunting. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both populations."
