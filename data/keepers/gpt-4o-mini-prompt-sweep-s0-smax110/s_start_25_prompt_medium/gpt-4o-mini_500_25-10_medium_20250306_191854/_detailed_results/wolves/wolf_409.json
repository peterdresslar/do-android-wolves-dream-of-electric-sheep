            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A theta of 0.4 strikes a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can stabilize, promoting long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. With a high sheep-to-wolf ratio, focusing on competition with other wolves will help maintain our population while giving the sheep a chance to rebound.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover while also managing competition with other wolves. This balanced approach supports the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery. Maintaining a lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both sheep and wolves, preventing overhunting while allowing for gradual adjustments as conditions change.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and a moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance. This approach allows for some sheep depletion while still enabling the wolf population to thrive without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still healthy at 93.7% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 41, I need to be cautious not to overhunt and risk depleting the sheep too quickly. A moderate increase to 0.45 allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some growth in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 84.3% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support the wolf population without risking a significant depletion of sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing sheep to recover and thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 59.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population being nearly equal to the sheep population, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight reduction from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring that both populations can thrive without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still considering the need to maintain a healthy sheep population. A gradual increase is prudent to avoid depleting resources too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 35.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.57, it is important to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting without over-depleting the sheep, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 30.56, which is only 27.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some recovery of the sheep while still ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.55, which is only 22.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is potential for recovery, I need to be cautious in my hunting intensity to allow the sheep to rebound. A slight decrease in theta will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can recover sustainably.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be increased slightly to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. This moderate increase helps maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.16, which is only 15.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is some opportunity for hunting, it is crucial to avoid overexploitation to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.04, which is only 13.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly."
