            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 81.1% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, I must remain cautious and avoid overhunting, as the wolf population is also significant. A moderate increase to 0.72 allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity. This will help maintain the balance between the wolf and sheep populations while ensuring that wolves can reproduce effectively. Gradually adjusting to a slightly lower hunting intensity will also allow the sheep to recover and prevent overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual adjustment is necessary to maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. This value helps ensure that we can sustain both the wolf and sheep populations while avoiding overhunting. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need to adapt to the gradual changes in both populations, a slight reduction in hunting intensity will support long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the wolf population is relatively high. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still providing enough resources for the wolves. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but I need to be cautious as the wolf population is relatively high. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain our population while allowing the sheep to recover gradually. This approach aligns with the wisdom of making small adjustments to ensure long-term balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and while it is important to maintain a healthy wolf population, I need to allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help ensure that we do not deplete the sheep further while still allowing for some hunting to support our pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.18, which is only 22.9% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will help balance the ecosystem without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.72, which is only 19.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased to support wolf reproduction, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.37, which is only 17.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly, considering the current wolf population is relatively high.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.56, which is only 16.0% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 will help balance competition among wolves and give sheep a chance to increase their numbers without depleting their population further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.48, which is only 15.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase to 0.40 allows for more hunting while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.59, which is only 14.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our wolf population without depleting the sheep further, promoting a more balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.16, which is only 13.8% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 to 0.40 reflects a cautious approach to hunting, balancing the need for sustenance with the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.80, which is only 13.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support our wolf population without risking a significant decline in the sheep population."
