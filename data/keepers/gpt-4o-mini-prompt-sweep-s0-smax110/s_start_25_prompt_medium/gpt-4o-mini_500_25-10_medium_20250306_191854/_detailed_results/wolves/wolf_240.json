            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 69.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still a healthy number of sheep available. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.32, it is essential to focus on maintaining a balance between hunting and competing with other wolves. A moderate theta of 0.30 allows for some hunting while also enabling the sheep population to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a balance between the wolf and sheep populations while avoiding overhunting. As the sheep population is recovering, a gradual increase in hunting will support wolf reproduction without risking a crash in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 43.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. Given the current wolf population is relatively high, a slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow for better coexistence and recovery of both populations. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of making gradual changes to maintain balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 36.02, which is only 32.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for more hunting while still considering the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.85, which is only 25.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I need to maintain some hunting to support wolf reproduction, I should focus more on competition with other wolves to allow the sheep population to recover. A slight decrease from my previous theta of 0.450 will help achieve a more sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.78, which is only 19.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for more hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance that supports both populations. It reflects a cautious approach to ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.74, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we are competing heavily for limited resources. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our own population. This gradual adjustment helps ensure long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.35, which is only 14.0% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting sustainable coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.41, which is only 12.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while prioritizing the long-term balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.29, which is only 11.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.30, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a significant competition for resources among wolves. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while also giving sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment helps maintain a balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.78, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain our wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.47, which is only 9.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are struggling, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to recover. Additionally, with a wolf population of 29, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.33, which is only 9.4% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting. This lower theta will help balance the populations and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.42, which is only 9.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.30 to 0.35, I can maintain a focus on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.57, which is only 9.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep further."
