            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 385\n- Sheep population: 13.41\n- Wolf population: 43.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.350\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.31 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 12.2% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and while I want to maintain a healthy wolf population, I also need to ensure that the sheep do not become too depleted. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will allow for sustainable coexistence while keeping an eye on the trends in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is close to its maximum capacity, indicating that they can sustain a bit more hunting without significant depletion. However, since the wolf population is also relatively stable, a moderate approach allows for continued reproduction while ensuring that we do not overhunt the sheep. This balance supports the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that can sustain both populations. This balance will help maintain the sheep population while also ensuring that the wolf population remains healthy and capable of thriving.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover and thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term survival of both species. This moderate adjustment will help maintain balance as the sheep population is recovering, and it allows for a cautious approach to avoid over-depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing sheep to recover gradually.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and while I want to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 30.57, which is only 27.8% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.50, which is only 22.3% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.35 aligns with the wisdom of making small adjustments in response to current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.05, which is only 18.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is some opportunity for hunting, it is crucial to avoid overexploitation to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still focusing on competition with other wolves, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.08, which is only 15.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain our wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing our needs.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.81, which is only 13.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is some opportunity for hunting, it is crucial to prioritize the recovery of the sheep population to ensure long-term sustainability. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, promoting a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.41, which is only 12.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I need to maintain some hunting to support wolf reproduction, I should not overhunt to allow the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while being mindful of the sheep"
