            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 387\n- Sheep population: 11.65\n- Wolf population: 34.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.400\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.34 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 10.6% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and my previous theta was very low. A gradual increase to 0.25 allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach balances the needs of both wolves and sheep, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 86.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with a wolf population of 47, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure sustainability. A moderate increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover and thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A moderate approach balances the needs of both species and avoids over-depletion of resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance of both populations. This adjustment will help sustain the sheep while also ensuring the wolf population remains healthy.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 39.14, which is only 35.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach that supports wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 30.57, which is only 27.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. Additionally, with a wolf population of 69, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.50, which is only 22.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach while still being mindful of the need to avoid overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.05, which is only 18.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for sustainable hunting without risking depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.08, which is only 15.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.81, which is only 13.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that I can afford to increase my hunting intensity slightly to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A gradual increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.41, which is only 12.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support our wolf population without risking a rapid decline in sheep numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.30, which is only 11.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting without risking a severe depletion of the sheep. By increasing theta slightly from 0.35 to 0.40, I can enhance hunting efforts to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover gradually. This moderate approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.65, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be slightly increased, it is crucial to avoid overexploitation to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for wolves to sustain their population."
