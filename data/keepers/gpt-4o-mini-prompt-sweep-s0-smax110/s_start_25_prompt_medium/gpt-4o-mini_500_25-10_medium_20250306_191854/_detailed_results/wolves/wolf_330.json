A balanced approach will help maintain both the sheep and wolf populations sustainably, avoiding depletion while still allowing for some hunting.",

Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover while keeping the wolf population stable. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and sustainable coexistence.",

This adjustment will help maintain our wolf population while ensuring that we do not over-deplete the sheep. A gradual increase aligns with the current trends and supports long-term coexistence.",

A slight decrease in hunting intensity allows for a balance that can support both populations without risking depletion.",

While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover.

This indicates that there is potential for recovery in the sheep population.
