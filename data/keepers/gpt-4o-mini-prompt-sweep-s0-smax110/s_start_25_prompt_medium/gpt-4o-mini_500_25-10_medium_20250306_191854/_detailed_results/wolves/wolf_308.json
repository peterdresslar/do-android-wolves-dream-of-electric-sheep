            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 74.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still a healthy number of sheep available. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.50, it is essential to maintain a balance to prevent overhunting. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will allow for sustainable coexistence while also supporting the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment reflects the need to balance our numbers with the sheep while still allowing for their recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 48.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 68, which is relatively high compared to the sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves while allowing the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 40.98, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be increased slightly to support wolf reproduction. However, I must be cautious and avoid overhunting, as the wolf population is also significant at 69.00. A gradual increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach that can sustain both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.43, which is only 29.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I need to maintain some hunting to support wolf reproduction, I should not overhunt to allow the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while being mindful of the declining sheep numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.49, which is only 23.2% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.450 to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for some hunting while still prioritizing the sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.82, which is only 18.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A moderate increase in hunting intensity allows for a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep can recover over time.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.45, which is only 15.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing for some hunting, ensuring a balance that supports both species in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the wolf population is relatively high. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain our population while allowing the sheep to recover. This adjustment is gradual, aligning with the wisdom of balancing our needs with the ecosystem",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.62, which is only 12.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack without depleting the sheep further, maintaining a balance that supports both species in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be increased slightly to support wolf reproduction. However, I must be cautious and avoid overhunting, so a gradual increase is appropriate to maintain balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.71, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 to 0.35 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for some hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.24, which is only 10.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without risking the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.89, which is only 9.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.400 to 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.81, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I need to maintain some hunting to support wolf reproduction, I should also be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still being mindful of the sheep",

This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack without depleting the sheep further, promoting a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.13, which is only 10.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I can increase my hunting intensity slightly, I must do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A theta of 0.40 allows for a moderate increase in hunting while still focusing on the long-term balance between wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.40, which is only 10.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability."
