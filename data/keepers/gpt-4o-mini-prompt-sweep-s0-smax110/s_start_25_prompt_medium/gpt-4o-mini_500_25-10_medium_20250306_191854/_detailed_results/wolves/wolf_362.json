            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 94.71, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain our wolf population while ensuring that we do not deplete the sheep too quickly. A gradual approach is necessary to maintain balance as both populations fluctuate.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the trends, a moderate approach will ensure long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 46.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 68, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level relative to the maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. This suggests a need to focus on competition among wolves rather than aggressive hunting of sheep to allow their numbers to recover. A moderate decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 30.57, which is only 27.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting without risking depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach to hunting while still considering the need to compete with other wolves as the population is relatively high.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.50, which is only 22.3% of its maximum capacity. Given the high wolf population of 64.00, it is prudent to focus on competition among wolves rather than aggressive hunting. This will allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.05, which is only 18.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is potential for recovery if I reduce hunting intensity slightly. By increasing theta from 0.35 to 0.40, I can still maintain a focus on hunting while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow, ensuring long-term sustainability for both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.08, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we need to be cautious with our hunting intensity. A moderate approach will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling us to compete effectively with other wolves. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.81, which is only 13.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some replenishment of the sheep population while still ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.41, which is only 12.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 to 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for wolf survival while ensuring the sheep population can stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.30, which is only 11.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need to support the wolf population.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.11, which is only 10.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain my pack without depleting the sheep too quickly.
