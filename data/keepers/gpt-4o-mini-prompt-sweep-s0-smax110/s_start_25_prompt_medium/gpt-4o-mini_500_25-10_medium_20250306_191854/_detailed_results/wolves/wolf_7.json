            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 38.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 57.00, it is wise to maintain a moderate hunting intensity to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly while still allowing for some reproduction among wolves. This approach balances the immediate need for food with the long-term health of both populations.",
