A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a more cautious approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment promotes wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery. A gradual increase aligns with the current dynamics of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 49.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 67, which is relatively high, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that supports both sheep recovery and wolf competition.",
            "I chose this theta because it represents a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balanced approach. The sheep population is currently at 38.3% of its maximum capacity, which allows for some sustainable hunting without risking a significant depletion of the sheep. This adjustment also accounts for the growing wolf population, ensuring that we do not overhunt and can maintain our numbers in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 29.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 69, which is relatively high, it is wise to focus on competition among wolves to prevent overhunting and allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the balance needed for long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.30, which is only 23.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still being mindful of the current wolf population."
