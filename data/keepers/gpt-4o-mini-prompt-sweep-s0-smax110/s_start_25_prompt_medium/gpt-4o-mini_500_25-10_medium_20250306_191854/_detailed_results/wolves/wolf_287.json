            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 316\n- Sheep population: 12.54\n- Wolf population: 39.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.350\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.32 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 11.4% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and while I need to maintain hunting to support wolf reproduction, I must also be cautious not to deplete the sheep too quickly. A slight reduction from my previous theta allows for sustainable hunting while still addressing the needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 88.2% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain our wolf population while still allowing sheep to recover. A gradual adjustment is necessary to maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 74.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, the wolf population is also significant at 55, which suggests that we should maintain a balanced approach to avoid over-depleting the sheep while still ensuring our own reproductive success. A theta of 0.60 allows for continued hunting without risking a crash in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 61.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population also being relatively high, a moderate approach allows for coexistence while preventing overexploitation of the sheep. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 48.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating there is still room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 68, which is relatively high, I need to be cautious about over-hunting. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery. A moderate increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, avoiding sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 29.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.47, it is crucial to maintain a balanced approach to ensure the long-term survival of both species. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while still enabling the wolf population to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.49, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we are competing for limited resources. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while still enabling us to maintain a healthy wolf population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments to ensure long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.82, which is only 18.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I want to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.35, which is only 14.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.62, which is only 12.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support our wolf population without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.54, which is only 11.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for wolves to thrive."
