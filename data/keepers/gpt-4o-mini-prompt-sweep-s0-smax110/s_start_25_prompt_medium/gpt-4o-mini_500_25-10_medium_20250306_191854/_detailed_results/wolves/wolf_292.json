            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 317\n- Sheep population: 11.71\n- Wolf population: 35.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.400\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.33 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 10.6% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is close to its maximum capacity, indicating that we can afford to hunt more intensively without risking immediate depletion. However, given the current wolf population, I want to avoid overhunting and ensure that we maintain a healthy balance. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for sustainable hunting while still promoting wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 88.2% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual adjustment is key to maintaining balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is key to avoiding depletion and fostering a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that balances the needs of both wolves and sheep. This approach will help maintain the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover and thrive, ensuring long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 48.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 68, it is wise to maintain a moderate hunting intensity to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly while still allowing for some reproduction among wolves. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 37.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.59, it is important to maintain a balance that allows both populations to thrive. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help the sheep recover while still allowing for some hunting to support the wolf population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining sustainable cycles.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and while it is important to maintain a balance, a slight increase in hunting intensity will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. This adjustment allows for sustainable coexistence while responding to the current state of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.49, which is only 23.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is some room for hunting, it is crucial to avoid overexploitation. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for sustainable hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach helps maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.82, which is only 18.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I need to maintain a focus on hunting to support wolf reproduction, I should do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate increase from my previous theta allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.45, which is only 15.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for the sheep to recover. By setting a lower theta, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.35, which is only 14.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.62, which is only 12.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover while also considering the growing wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, focusing on competition among wolves while still enabling some hunting to ensure our survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.54, which is only 11.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.71, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 reflects a balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to support reproduction."
