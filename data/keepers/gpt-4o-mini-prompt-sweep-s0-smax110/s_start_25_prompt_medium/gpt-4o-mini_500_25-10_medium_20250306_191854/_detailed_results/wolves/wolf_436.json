            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual increase is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term health of both populations. This moderate adjustment will help maintain balance as the sheep recover, while also ensuring the wolf population remains stable.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but still below maximum capacity. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious to avoid depleting the sheep population further. This balance helps maintain both populations in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 30.56, which is only 27.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.4 to 0.35, I can maintain a focus on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring that both populations can stabilize and thrive in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.55, which is only 22.3% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still being cautious. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.12, which is only 18.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support our wolf population without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.16, which is only 15.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting without risking depletion. By increasing my theta slightly from 0.35 to 0.40, I can begin to take advantage of the available sheep while still allowing for their recovery and maintaining a balance with the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.04, which is only 13.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to allow the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack without depleting the sheep further, promoting a balance that can lead to long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.60, which is only 12.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.57, which is only 11.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own wolf population. A moderate approach will help maintain a balance, ensuring both species can thrive without depleting resources too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.87, which is only 10.8% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, a slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted to take advantage of the current sheep availability without depleting them too quickly. This moderate adjustment allows for a sustainable approach while still considering the need for balance as the wolf population is relatively high.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.44, which is only 10.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep population while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our own health. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking a rapid depletion of the sheep, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.19, which is only 10.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I can increase my hunting intensity slightly, I should still prioritize a balanced approach to allow the sheep population to recover. A small increase to 0.40 reflects a cautious strategy that supports both my needs and the sustainability of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.07, which is only 10.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is potential for recovery in the sheep population. By setting a lower theta, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep to recover while maintaining a sustainable balance. This gradual adjustment helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.14, which is only 10.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach that considers both the immediate needs of the wolves and the long-term sustainability of the ecosystem."
