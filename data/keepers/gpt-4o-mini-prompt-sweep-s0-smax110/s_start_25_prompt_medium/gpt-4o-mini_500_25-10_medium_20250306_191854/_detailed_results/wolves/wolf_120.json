            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 38.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, I need to be cautious about overhunting to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring both populations can thrive without leading to a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 29.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.47, it is essential to maintain a balance that allows both populations to thrive. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help the sheep recover while still allowing for some hunting to support the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and while I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta will enable me to maintain some hunting intensity while still being cautious about the sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.50, which is only 18.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight reduction from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, focusing on maintaining both wolf and sheep populations sustainably.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.39, which is only 15.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover, I still need to maintain some level of hunting to support the wolf population. A theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.26, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable balance, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting sheep. This will help maintain the sheep population while also keeping the wolf population in check.",

This indicates that the sheep need time to recover, and focusing on competition with other wolves will allow for a more sustainable ecosystem. By keeping theta lower, I can help the sheep population recover while also managing the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.21, which is only 10.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for the sheep to recover without putting too much pressure on their population. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.300 to 0.350, I can still focus on competing with other wolves while allowing for a sustainable balance. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
