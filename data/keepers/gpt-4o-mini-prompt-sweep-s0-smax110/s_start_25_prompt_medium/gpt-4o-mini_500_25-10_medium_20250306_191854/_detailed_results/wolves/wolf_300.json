            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 88.2% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still focusing on competition with other wolves. This approach will help maintain a balance, allowing both populations to thrive without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 74.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 55, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure our long-term survival. A moderate increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover gradually.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still promoting sustainability. This adjustment reflects the need to balance the growing wolf population with the available sheep, ensuring that neither species faces immediate danger.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 37.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.59, I need to be cautious about hunting too aggressively to avoid depleting the sheep population. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level relative to its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. A moderate theta allows for a focus on competition with other wolves while still enabling some hunting, which helps maintain a balance and allows the sheep to recover. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.49, which is only 23.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the immediate needs of the wolf pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.82, which is only 18.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some reproduction among wolves while still giving sheep a chance to recover. A moderate increase from my previous theta of 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, ensuring that both populations can thrive without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.45, which is only 15.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is an opportunity for the sheep to recover if I focus more on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.35, which is only 14.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.62, which is only 12.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population and maintaining a balance with the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.54, which is only 11.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain my pack while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help balance the needs of my pack without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.71, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate increase to 0.35 allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring a balance that promotes long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.24, which is only 10.2% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. A gradual increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.89, which is only 9.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our wolf population. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, ensuring both species can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.81, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and ensures the long-term survival of both species."
