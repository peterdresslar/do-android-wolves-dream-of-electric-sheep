            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 83.45, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 56.00, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. It reflects a balanced approach, responding to the current conditions without risking overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 47.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 37.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 70, it is wise to maintain a moderate hunting intensity to allow for both sheep recovery and wolf population stability. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to ensure long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.56, which is only 28.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the long-term balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.70, which is only 23.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for gradual hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring both populations can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.65, which is only 18.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A moderate increase in theta to 0.45 reflects a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without risking a rapid depletion of sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.91, which is only 15.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack while prioritizing the long-term balance of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.72, which is only 13.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.12, which is only 11.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should prioritize the recovery of the sheep while still allowing for some hunting to sustain our wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, ensuring that we do not deplete the sheep further while still competing effectively with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.01, which is only 10.9% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a bit more hunting to support reproduction while still prioritizing the sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance while still allowing for some hunting to support the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.80, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help maintain a balance and prevent overhunting, which could lead to a crash in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.51, which is only 9.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to thrive. A small increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a cautious approach to hunting, balancing the need for food with the sustainability of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.41, which is only 9.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is a need for a cautious approach to hunting. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.35 to 0.40, I can maintain a focus on sustainable coexistence while allowing for a gradual increase in hunting intensity as the sheep population stabilizes. This small adjustment helps balance the needs of both wolves and sheep without risking a population crash."
