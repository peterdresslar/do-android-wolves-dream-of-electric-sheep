            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and I want to maintain a balance that allows for sustainable hunting while ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. A slight decrease from my previous theta will help prevent over-depletion of the sheep while still allowing for some hunting to support reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 88.2% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover if needed. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 74.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still a healthy number of sheep available. However, with the wolf population at 55, I need to be cautious about overhunting. A moderate theta allows for sustainable hunting while also considering the growth of the wolf population, ensuring we do not deplete the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while I want to ensure my pack thrives, I need to be cautious about overhunting. A slight reduction from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still giving sheep a chance to recover, maintaining balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment reflects a balanced approach, considering the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need to maintain a healthy wolf population. Gradually increasing theta will help sustain both populations while avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 37.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, which is relatively high, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that supports both sheep recovery and wolf population stability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.43, which is only 29.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is still room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.49, which is only 23.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for sustainable hunting without risking depletion. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.450 to 0.40, I can help maintain a balance that supports both wolf reproduction and sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.82 and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance while avoiding over-depletion of sheep, ensuring both populations can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.45, which is only 15.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.35, which is only 14.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it is crucial to do so gradually to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate increase to 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.62, which is only 12.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.54, which is only 11.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.4 to 0.35, I can maintain a focus on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring a balance that supports both populations over time.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.71, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help sustain my pack while still allowing the sheep population a chance to recover. A gradual increase is essential to maintain balance and avoid sudden crashes."
