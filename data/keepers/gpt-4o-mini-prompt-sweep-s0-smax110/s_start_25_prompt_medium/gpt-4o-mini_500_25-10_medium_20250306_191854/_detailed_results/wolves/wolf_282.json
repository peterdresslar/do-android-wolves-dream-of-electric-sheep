            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that they can sustain some hunting pressure without immediate risk of depletion. However, since the wolf population is also significant, I need to ensure that we don",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and while I want to maintain a healthy wolf population, I also need to ensure that the sheep do not become too depleted. A moderate increase in hunting intensity allows for some reproduction among wolves while still being cautious about the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight reduction in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a sustainable balance while still enabling the wolf population to thrive. A moderate approach will ensure that we do not deplete the sheep too quickly, allowing for future hunting opportunities.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 88.2% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover without being overhunted. A gradual adjustment is necessary to maintain balance and avoid sudden population crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we can maintain a balanced approach. This allows for continued hunting while ensuring the sheep can recover and thrive, supporting the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while I want to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I also recognize the need to allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain balance while still allowing for some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, but the wolf population is also significant. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to thrive. This moderate approach helps maintain a balance and avoids depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level relative to its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain their numbers. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments to ensure long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.43, which is only 29.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting without risking depletion. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.35 to 0.40, I can help ensure the wolf population remains healthy while still allowing the sheep to recover over time.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.49, which is only 23.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own wolf population. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, ensuring both species can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.82, which is only 18.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some recovery of the sheep while still ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach that supports both populations without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.45, which is only 15.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to allow for recovery. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both sheep and wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.35, which is only 14.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach while still considering the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.62, which is only 12.4% of its maximum capacity.
