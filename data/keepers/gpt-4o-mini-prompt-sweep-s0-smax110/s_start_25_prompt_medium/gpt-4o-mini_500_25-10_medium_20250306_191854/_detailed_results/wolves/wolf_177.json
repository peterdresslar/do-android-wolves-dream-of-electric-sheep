            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is key to avoiding overexploitation and ensuring long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain our wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level relative to its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A theta of 0.45 strikes a balance between hunting and competition, promoting sustainable coexistence while still allowing for some hunting to support the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.56, which is only 28.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support our wolf population without over-depleting the sheep, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.70, which is only 23.4% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will enable me to hunt more effectively while still prioritizing the sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.65, which is only 18.8% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.400 helps maintain balance and allows for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.91, which is only 15.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of avoiding sudden changes and promotes a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.72, which is only 13.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is a need for a cautious approach to hunting.

A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",

This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need to adapt to the changing conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.27, which is only 10.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing competition with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.80, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should be cautious with our hunting to allow the sheep to recover. However, since the wolf population is relatively high at 31.00, a slight increase in hunting intensity to 0.40 will help maintain our population without depleting the sheep too quickly. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of making gradual changes while considering both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.51, which is only 9.6% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting. This moderate adjustment will help ensure the long-term survival of both species while maintaining a balance.",
