            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and while we need to ensure our hunting supports wolf reproduction, we must also allow the sheep to recover. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 96.09, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. Maintaining a moderate theta of 0.50 will help ensure the sustainability of both the sheep and wolf populations, allowing for gradual adjustments as conditions change.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for some hunting without risking depletion. However, with the wolf population also growing, it",
            "I chose this theta because it represents a balanced approach to hunting and competition. The sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for moderate hunting without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain the wolf population while ensuring the sheep can recover and thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the sheep-to-wolf ratio being relatively low, I want to ensure that we do not deplete the sheep too quickly while still allowing for some hunting to support our wolf population. A slight decrease from my previous theta will help maintain sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 37.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.58, it is crucial to maintain a balance that allows both populations to thrive. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help ensure the sheep can recover while still allowing for some hunting to support the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.56, which is only 28.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance, reducing hunting intensity slightly to support sheep recovery while still allowing for some hunting to sustain our pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.70, which is only 23.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.65, which is only 18.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a more balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still being mindful of the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.91, which is only 15.4% of its maximum capacity. While I want to ensure the survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to be cautious about hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease from my previous theta of 0.450 will help balance the competition among wolves while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.72, which is only 13.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a presence in the hunting cycle. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support our wolf population without depleting the sheep further, promoting a more sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.12, which is only 11.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.01, which is only 10.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is some room for hunting, I need to be cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for wolf population sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.27, which is only 10.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover rather than intensifying our hunting. By maintaining a lower theta, we can reduce competition among wolves and support the sheep population"
