            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 69.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, since the wolf population is also significant at 58, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight reduction from my previous theta allows for continued hunting while also considering the need for sustainability and the potential growth of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for some increased hunting intensity without risking depletion. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need to maintain a healthy wolf population, a moderate increase in hunting will help support reproduction while still allowing the sheep to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 43.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with a wolf population of 69, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 32.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, the wolf population is relatively high, so a moderate approach will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep too quickly. This theta allows for some hunting while also considering the need for coexistence and the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.85, which is only 25.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is potential for recovery if I reduce hunting intensity. By setting theta to 0.45, I can maintain a balanced approach that allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some hunting to support the wolf population. This gradual adjustment will help prevent over-depletion of sheep and ensure long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.78, which is only 19.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is potential for recovery if I reduce my hunting intensity slightly. By lowering theta to 0.40, I can focus on maintaining a balance that allows the sheep to recover while still ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of avoiding sudden changes and responding to the current state of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.74, which is only 16.1% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep some time to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 will enable me to maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.35, which is only 14.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize while avoiding overhunting. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.41, which is only 12.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we can afford to increase our hunting intensity slightly to support our reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A gradual increase to 0.40 allows us to maintain a balance while being mindful of the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.29, which is only 11.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the sustainability of both populations. Additionally, with a wolf population of 42, a slight reduction in hunting intensity is warranted to prevent overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.30, which is only 10.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.78, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.4 to 0.35, I can still maintain some hunting activity while prioritizing the long-term survival of both species. This gradual adjustment will help avoid over-depletion of the sheep and support a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.47, which is only 9.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some reproduction among wolves while still enabling the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.33, which is only 9.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing more on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.42, which is only 9.5% of its maximum capacity. While I want to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I also recognize the need for a gradual increase in hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 to 0.40 reflects a cautious approach that balances the immediate need for sustenance with the long-term goal of maintaining a sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.57, which is only 9.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves and allow the sheep population to stabilize, ensuring long-term survival for both species.
