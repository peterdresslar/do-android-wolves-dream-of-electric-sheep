            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 96.09, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio of 2.04, a moderate increase to 0.45 allows for sustainable coexistence while being mindful of future conditions.",

A slight reduction to 0.50 allows for continued hunting while also giving sheep a chance to recover, maintaining a balance that supports both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for some hunting without risking depletion. Given the wolf population is also relatively high, a slight reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and ensure both populations can thrive in the long term.",

This moderate adjustment helps maintain balance as the wolf population is relatively high, and it allows for gradual adaptation to changing conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.56, which is only 28.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain its health. By slightly reducing hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species and avoid depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.70, which is only 23.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",

This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover.
