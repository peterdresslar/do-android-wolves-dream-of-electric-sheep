With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 18.33, it is important to maintain a balance that allows for sustainable coexistence while still ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach, promoting recovery of the sheep while still enabling some hunting.",
