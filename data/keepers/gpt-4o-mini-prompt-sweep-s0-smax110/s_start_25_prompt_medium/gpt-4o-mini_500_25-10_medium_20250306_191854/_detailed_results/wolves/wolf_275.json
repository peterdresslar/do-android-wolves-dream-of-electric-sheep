            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to prevent depletion. A theta of 0.6 allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while ensuring that the sheep population can recover and maintain balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A balanced approach will help maintain the sheep population while ensuring the wolf pack remains healthy. This adjustment reflects the need to adapt to the current conditions without making drastic changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity slightly to allow the sheep to recover while still competing with other wolves. This moderate approach will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover. This will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem and prevent potential crashes in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is very close to its maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderate to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population does not decline too rapidly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 88.2% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 74.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still a healthy number of sheep available. However, with the wolf population at 55, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still ensuring their recovery. This adjustment reflects the need to balance my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 48.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 68, I need to be cautious about overhunting. A slight decrease in hunting intensity allows for a sustainable balance, giving sheep a chance to recover while still supporting the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level relative to its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to sustain itself. This approach helps maintain a balance, avoiding overhunting and ensuring both species can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 29.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.35 to 0.40, I can help ensure the wolf population remains healthy while still allowing the sheep to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.49, which is only 23.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.82, which is only 18.9% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, allowing both populations to stabilize without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.45, which is only 15.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is some opportunity for hunting, it is crucial to prioritize the recovery of the sheep population to ensure long-term sustainability. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, promoting a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.35, which is only 14.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly."
