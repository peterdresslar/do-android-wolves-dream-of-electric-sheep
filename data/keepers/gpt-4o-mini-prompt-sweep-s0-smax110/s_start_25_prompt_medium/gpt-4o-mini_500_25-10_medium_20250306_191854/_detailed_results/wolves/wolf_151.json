            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A value of 0.4 reflects a balanced approach, enabling some hunting while also considering the need to prevent over-depletion of the sheep population. This will help maintain a sustainable ecosystem for both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while also reducing competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment helps maintain a sustainable balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is close to its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a sustainable balance. This adjustment will help support the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 96.09, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. It reflects a cautious approach to ensure both populations can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, but the wolf population is also significant. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow sheep to recover while still enabling wolves to thrive. This adjustment supports a sustainable balance without risking over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual increase is necessary to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring long-term balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, and while it is beneficial to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must also consider the growing wolf population. A theta of 0.40 allows for a balanced approach that promotes coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help support the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover gradually.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.56, which is only 28.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.70, which is only 23.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is potential for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still being mindful of the sheep population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.65, which is only 18.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a more aggressive approach to hunting while still being cautious, as the wolf population is relatively high. This balance aims to ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.91, which is only 15.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This moderate approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low at 14.72, which is only 13.4% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will enable me to maintain a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance while still allowing for some hunting to support wolf reproduction."
