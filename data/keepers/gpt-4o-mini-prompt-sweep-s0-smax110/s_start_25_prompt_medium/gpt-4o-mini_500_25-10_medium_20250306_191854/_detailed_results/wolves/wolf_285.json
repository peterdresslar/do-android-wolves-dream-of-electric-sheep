            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 303\n- Sheep population: 109.57\n- Wolf population: 33.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.142\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 3.32 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 99.6% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is very close to its maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 3.32, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating a need for cautious hunting to prevent depletion. A moderate increase from my previous theta allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 88.2% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 46.00, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing sheep to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but I need to be cautious as the wolf population is also significant. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to thrive. This moderate approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 37.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.59, it is essential to maintain a balanced approach to ensure the long-term survival of both species. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow sheep to recover while still enabling wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 29.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, which is relatively high, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.49, which is only 23.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.45 allows for a balanced approach that supports both wolf reproduction and sheep recovery, while still being cautious of the wolf population growth.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.82, which is only 18.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 strikes a balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep, promoting sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.45, which is only 15.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the wolf population is relatively high. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf pack to maintain its numbers. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.62, which is only 12.4% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a bit more hunting intensity while still prioritizing balance and sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.54, which is only 11.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on the competition among wolves, ensuring a balance that promotes long-term sustainability."
