            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 118\n- Sheep population: 18.62\n- Wolf population: 6.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.450\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 3.10 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 16.9% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 49.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 67, which is relatively high, I need to focus on competition among wolves to prevent overhunting and allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.30 strikes a balance between ensuring the wolves can thrive while also allowing the sheep population to stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly, and this balance supports long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 29.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.47, it is important to maintain a balanced approach to ensure the long-term survival of both populations. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 23.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.38, a slight increase in hunting intensity will help support wolf reproduction while still allowing for the sheep population to recover. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of making gradual changes to maintain balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.50, which is only 18.6% of its maximum capacity.
