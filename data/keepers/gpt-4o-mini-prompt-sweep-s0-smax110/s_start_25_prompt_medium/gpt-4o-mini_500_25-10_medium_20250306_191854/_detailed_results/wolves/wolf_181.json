            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 163\n- Sheep population: 68.36\n- Wolf population: 63.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.220\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 1.09 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 62.1% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.09, it is essential to avoid overhunting to ensure the long-term survival of both species. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, enabling the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for some increased hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population while also considering the need for sheep recovery. A gradual increase in hunting intensity aligns with the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and ensures a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment reflects the need to balance the growing wolf population while still ensuring the sheep can recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.56, which is only 28.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while we need to be cautious about hunting to allow the sheep to recover, we also need to maintain a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, reducing the risk of over-depletion of sheep while still enabling some hunting.",

This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach to hunting while still considering the need for wolf population stability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.65, which is only 18.8% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.40 will help maintain balance and avoid sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.91, which is only 15.4% of its maximum capacity.

A theta of 0.35 strikes a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep can rebound, promoting long-term sustainability.",

A theta of 0.35 reflects a slight increase in hunting compared to my previous value, allowing for a balanced approach that promotes coexistence.",

This suggests that a more moderate hunting intensity is necessary to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling my pack to maintain a healthy population. A small increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a gradual adjustment in response to the current conditions without risking a rapid depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.51, which is only 9.6% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and maintain a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting sheep. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 reflects a cautious approach to ensure both populations can thrive in the long term.",

This will help balance the ecosystem and prevent a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.54, which is only 9.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is an opportunity to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction while still allowing for some recovery of the sheep population. A small increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.80, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should prioritize allowing the sheep to recover rather than intensifying hunting. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring a balance that supports both populations in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.17, which is only 10.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is an opportunity to hunt, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach to hunting while still considering the need for sheep recovery and the overall health of the ecosystem.",
