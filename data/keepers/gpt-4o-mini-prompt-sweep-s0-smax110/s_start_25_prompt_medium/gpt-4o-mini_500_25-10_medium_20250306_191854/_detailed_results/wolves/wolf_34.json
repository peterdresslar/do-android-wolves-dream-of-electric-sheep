            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 81.1% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can still recover. A moderate increase from my previous theta allows for sustainable coexistence without risking a rapid depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 82.71, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that can support wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep population remains sustainable. This approach balances the need for immediate food with the long-term health of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 66.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.63, it is essential to maintain a balance that allows for sustainable coexistence. A slight decrease from my previous theta of 0.60 will help ensure that I do not over-deplete the sheep while still allowing for some hunting to support the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the sheep-to-wolf ratio at 1.23, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to ensure sustainability as the sheep population is recovering, while also considering the growing wolf numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while I want to ensure my pack thrives, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and prevent over-depletion of the sheep population, which is crucial for long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population also being relatively high, I want to avoid overhunting and ensure that both populations can thrive. A gradual increase in theta will help maintain balance without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight reduction in hunting intensity. This will help maintain the sheep population while also considering the growing wolf numbers. A gradual adjustment will support long-term balance and coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.18, which is only 22.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance and ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.72, which is only 19.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for gradual hunting without risking depletion. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.35 to 0.40, I can help ensure the wolf population remains healthy while still allowing the sheep to recover sustainably.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.37, which is only 17.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the immediate needs of the wolf pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.56, which is only 16.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a moderate approach, balancing the need to compete with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to sustain the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.48, which is only 15.0% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will enable me to hunt more effectively while still prioritizing the long-term balance of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.59, which is only 14.2% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I also want to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for some hunting to support reproduction while still prioritizing the sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.16, which is only 13.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting sheep. This will allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a healthy balance in the wolf population."
