Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring a sustainable balance.",

Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover and ensures the long-term survival of both species. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio, it",

Maintaining a lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, preventing overexploitation of the sheep population while allowing for gradual adjustments as conditions change.",

Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover while keeping the wolf population stable.",

This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring both can thrive in the long term.",
