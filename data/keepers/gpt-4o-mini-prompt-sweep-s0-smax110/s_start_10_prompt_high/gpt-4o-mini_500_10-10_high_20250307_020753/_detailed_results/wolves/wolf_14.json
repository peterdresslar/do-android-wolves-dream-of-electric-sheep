            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio suggests that we can increase our hunting intensity without risking the sheep's long-term survival. This adjustment will help us capitalize on the abundance of sheep while still allowing for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity while still ensuring the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep. This adjustment reflects a balance between maintaining a healthy wolf population and allowing sheep to recover, considering the current state and trends.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently abundant at 88.28, which allows for a more aggressive hunting strategy without immediately threatening their recovery. Increasing theta to 0.85 reflects a balance between maximizing our reproductive potential and ensuring that we do not deplete the sheep population too quickly. This gradual increase aligns with the wisdom of adapting to the current state of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help sustain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover and thrive. A gradual approach is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful at 85.80, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while ensuring that the sheep population remains sustainable. A gradual approach helps maintain balance and avoids depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, and maintaining a moderate hunting intensity allows for sustainable coexistence. Given that the wolf population is moderately high, a slight reduction in hunting intensity will help balance our numbers while still allowing for reproduction and ensuring the sheep population does not decline too rapidly.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while avoiding over-depletion of the sheep. Given the current high wolf population, a slight reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and prevent competition from becoming too fierce.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, but the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow for better coexistence and give sheep a chance to recover while still enabling wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity slightly. This will allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, and a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while we manage our own numbers. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy, but the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A slight increase in hunting intensity allows for some reproduction while still giving sheep a chance to recover. This moderate adjustment helps maintain balance without risking a crash.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support reproduction while still prioritizing the balance needed for both populations to thrive.",
