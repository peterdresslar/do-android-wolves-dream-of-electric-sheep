This will help sustain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover over time. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance.",

A theta of 0.50 allows for a balanced approach, enabling sustainable coexistence while still providing some hunting opportunities. This adjustment helps maintain the sheep population and prevents overexploitation, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",

A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling us to sustain our pack. This moderate approach aligns with the need for balance and avoids sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
