This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still maintaining a sustainable balance.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful at 86.45, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help ensure the wolf population can thrive while still allowing the sheep to recover and maintain a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently abundant, allowing for a more aggressive hunting strategy. Increasing my hunting intensity will help ensure the wolf population can thrive while still allowing for some sheep recovery. This adjustment is gradual, aligning with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while still ensuring that the sheep population can sustain itself. A gradual increase helps maintain balance and avoids depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful at 82.35, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. However, the wolf population is also moderately high, so I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure sustainability. A theta of 0.60 strikes a balance between hunting and allowing for recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, but the wolf population is moderately high. A theta of 0.50 allows for a balanced approach, enabling sustainable coexistence while still permitting some hunting to support wolf reproduction. This adjustment will help prevent over-depletion of the sheep population as the wolf numbers grow.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, but the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A slight reduction in hunting intensity allows for better coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves. This approach helps maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition among wolves. While the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow for better coexistence and give sheep a chance to recover, while still enabling wolves to sustain themselves.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A moderate decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while also addressing the competition among wolves.
