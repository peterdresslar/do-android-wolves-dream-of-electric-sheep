            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A moderate hunting intensity allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while giving sheep a chance to recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while the wolf population is also low, a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted, but I must be careful not to deplete the sheep further. This moderate adjustment will help maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while I want to allow for some hunting to support our growth, I must be cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still being mindful of the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while the wolf population is also low, I need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep to ensure long-term sustainability. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, which will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, and my current focus should be on competing with other wolves to ensure a balance in the ecosystem. This lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover while also giving my pack a chance to stabilize and grow without overexploiting the sheep resource.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, indicating a need for cautious hunting to prevent over-depletion. However, with a relatively low wolf population, I can afford to increase my hunting intensity slightly to support wolf growth while still allowing the sheep to recover.
