            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 47.1% of maximum capacity, indicating there is room for sustainable hunting. However, the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep too quickly, allowing for gradual adaptation to the changing conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, and while the wolf population is also relatively high, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help sustain the wolf population while allowing for some recovery in the sheep population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",

This adjustment reflects the need to respond to the decreasing sheep-to-wolf ratio while still prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
