            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 28\n- Sheep population: 84.06\n- Wolf population: 8.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.961\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 10.51 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 76.4% of maximum capacity\n\nEcosystem observations:\n- The wolf population is relatively low, which may present opportunities for growth.\n- Sheep are reasonably plentiful.\n- There are many sheep per wolf, suggesting the ecosystem could support more hunting.\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 10.51, there is ample opportunity for us to hunt without depleting the sheep too quickly. This adjustment allows for potential growth in our wolf population while still being mindful of the long-term balance.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is abundant at 88.28, allowing for a more aggressive hunting strategy without risking immediate depletion. Increasing theta to 0.85 will help us capitalize on the current sheep surplus while still being mindful of the need for balance as wolf numbers grow.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, and the current wolf population is moderately high. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves. This approach balances the need for hunting with the goal of preventing over-depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, but the wolf population is moderately high. A theta of 0.50 allows for a balanced approach, enabling sustainable coexistence while avoiding overhunting. This adjustment also considers the trend of the sheep-to-wolf ratio becoming less favorable, allowing for a slight reduction in hunting intensity to ensure long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, but the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, allowing sheep to recover while also ensuring the wolf population remains healthy.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, but the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow for better coexistence and give sheep a chance to recover while still supporting our wolf population.",

The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow the sheep population to recover. By focusing on competition rather than intense hunting, I can help stabilize the ecosystem and ensure long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that increased competition among wolves is likely. A moderate increase in hunting intensity allows for some replenishment of the sheep population while still addressing the need for wolf reproduction. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance without risking a crash in either population.",

By lowering the hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and helps maintain a balance in the ecosystem.",

This moderate adjustment helps maintain balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
