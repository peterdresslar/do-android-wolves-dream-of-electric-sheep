A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still keeping the wolf population healthy. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain our population while allowing for some recovery of the sheep. This adjustment is gradual, aligning with the wisdom of adapting to changing conditions without causing sudden disruptions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating a need to focus more on competition with other wolves rather than intensifying hunting. This adjustment allows the sheep population to recover while maintaining a healthy balance in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain our wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover. This adjustment is gradual and considers both the current state and trends in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to thrive. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem."
