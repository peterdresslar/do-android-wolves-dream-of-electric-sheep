A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow sheep to recover while still enabling wolves to maintain their population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments to ensure long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the wolf population is moderately high. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain our population while allowing for some recovery in the sheep population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that I should focus more on competing with other wolves to allow the sheep population to recover. A moderate decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance while ensuring that both populations can thrive in the long term."
