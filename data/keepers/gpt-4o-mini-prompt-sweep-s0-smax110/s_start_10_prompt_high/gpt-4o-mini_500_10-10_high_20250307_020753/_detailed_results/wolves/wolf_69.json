A gradual increase in theta will support sustainable coexistence while ensuring that both populations can thrive.",

A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while still enabling wolves to maintain their numbers. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of ensuring long-term survival and sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a sustainable balance. This adjustment reflects the need to adapt to the growing wolf population and the less favorable sheep-to-wolf ratio, ensuring both species can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 46.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that while there is some room for hunting, the wolf population is moderately high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity slightly to allow the sheep to recover while still competing with other wolves. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance.",

However, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, suggesting that I should be cautious about increasing hunting intensity too quickly.
