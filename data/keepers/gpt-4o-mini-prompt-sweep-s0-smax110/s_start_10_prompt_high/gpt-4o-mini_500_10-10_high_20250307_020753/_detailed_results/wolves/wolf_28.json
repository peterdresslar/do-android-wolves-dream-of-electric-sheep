            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, and the wolf population is moderately high. A theta of 0.50 allows for a balanced approach, ensuring that we can hunt enough to sustain our pack while still allowing the sheep population to recover and thrive. This gradual adjustment helps maintain a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, but the wolf population is moderately high. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow for a more sustainable balance, giving sheep a chance to recover while still ensuring that wolves can thrive. This adjustment aligns with the need to respond to the changing sheep-to-wolf ratio.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, but the wolf population is quite high, leading to increased competition. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow for better coexistence and give the sheep a chance to recover while still ensuring the wolves maintain a healthy population.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, which suggests increased competition among wolves. The sheep population is also reasonably plentiful, but the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. By slightly lowering my hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
