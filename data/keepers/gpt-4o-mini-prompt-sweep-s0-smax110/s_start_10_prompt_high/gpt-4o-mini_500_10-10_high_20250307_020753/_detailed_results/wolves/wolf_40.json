            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 130\n- Sheep population: 46.63\n- Wolf population: 21.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.450\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 2.22 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 42.4% of maximum capacity\n\nEcosystem observations:\n- The ratio of sheep to wolves is becoming less favorable, which may require adaptation.\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

However, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, suggesting that I should be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that I need to focus on competition with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover. A moderate theta of 0.40 strikes a balance between hunting and ensuring the sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 41.1% of its maximum capacity, allowing for some sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that I should focus on competition with other wolves to maintain a healthy wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual adjustment towards lower hunting intensity will help balance the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain the balance as the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A gradual increase in theta will support the wolf population while still allowing sheep to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that we need to focus more on competing with other wolves to stabilize our population while allowing the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain the balance and support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover gradually.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain our population while allowing for some recovery of the sheep. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of adapting to changing conditions without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that while the sheep population is still relatively healthy, I need to focus on maintaining a balance. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to thrive. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of adapting to changing conditions without causing sudden disruptions."
