            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased slightly, indicating a potential scarcity of food. With an increase in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough prey without exhausting myself or competing too fiercely with other wolves. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 17 wolves competing for food, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still taking advantage of the available prey. This approach minimizes the risk of overexertion and ensures I can hunt effectively in the future.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a potentially scarce environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of catching enough food while still conserving energy. This balance is crucial for my survival, especially with other wolves competing for the same resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, competition for food is higher, so a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because with the number of sheep increasing and the wolf population stable, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can catch enough food without overexerting myself. A theta of 0.65 allows me to be more efficient in hunting while still being competitive.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, which means food is scarcer. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are likely hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to survive longer in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and wait for a better opportunity to hunt when the situation improves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 21 wolves competing for food, a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means hunting might be less rewarding. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, ensuring my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity. By increasing my theta from 0.30 to 0.50, I can take advantage of the available prey while still conserving energy and avoiding overexertion, which is crucial for my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of securing enough food while still being mindful of the competition from other wolves. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly from my previous theta of 0.65 to 0.75, I can maximize my chances of securing enough food while still being mindful of the competition from other wolves. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at full intensity may lead to competition and less chance of a successful hunt. A slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, adapting to the current situation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating less food availability. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and increase my chances of survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting may be less successful. By increasing my intensity slightly from 0.45 to 0.55, I can take advantage of the remaining sheep while still being cautious, as the wolf population remains constant. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and reduce competition for the remaining sheep. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my intensity slightly from 0.40 to 0.50, I can improve my chances of catching prey without overexerting myself, which is crucial for my survival given the current population of wolves remains unchanged.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts.
