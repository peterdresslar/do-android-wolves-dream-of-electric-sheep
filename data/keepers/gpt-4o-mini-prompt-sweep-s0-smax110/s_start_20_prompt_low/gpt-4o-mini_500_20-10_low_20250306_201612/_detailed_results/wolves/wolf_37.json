            "I chose this theta because with the increase in the number of wolves, competition for food is intensifying. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of securing enough food while still conserving some energy. This balance is crucial for my survival in a growing pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased slightly, indicating a stable food source. By increasing my hunting intensity from 0.60 to 0.75, I can take advantage of this opportunity while still conserving energy compared to maximum intensity. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population means more competition for the available sheep. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the hunt. This strategy allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics and increases my chances of survival in a crowded environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the number of wolves. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively when necessary. This balance increases my chances of survival in a fluctuating environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of catching enough prey while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a growing pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with the number of wolves remaining stable, a lower hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. This strategy increases my chances of survival by avoiding overexertion and ensuring I can hunt effectively in the future.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. With more wolves around, a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive. This balance increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
