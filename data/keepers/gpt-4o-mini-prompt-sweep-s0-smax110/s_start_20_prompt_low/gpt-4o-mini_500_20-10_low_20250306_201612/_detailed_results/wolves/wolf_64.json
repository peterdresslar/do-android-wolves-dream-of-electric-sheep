            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased slightly, indicating a stable food source. However, the number of wolves remains the same, which means competition for food is still present. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.40, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively if needed. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
