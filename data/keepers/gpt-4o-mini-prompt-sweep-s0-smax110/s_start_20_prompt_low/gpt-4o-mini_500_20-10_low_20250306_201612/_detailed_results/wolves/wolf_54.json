With the number of wolves remaining constant, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to balance the need for food while avoiding overexertion. This way, I can ensure my survival without risking depletion of resources.",
            "I chose this theta because with 44.39 sheep and 17 wolves, the competition for food is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and increases my chances of survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. By increasing my intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion, ensuring my survival while still being cautious of the other wolves.",
