            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and with 16 wolves competing for food, a moderate intensity will allow me to conserve energy while still increasing my chances of a successful hunt. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased slightly, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy while still being active enough to catch prey when opportunities arise. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can maximize my chances of catching enough prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population decreasing and the number of wolves remaining stable, hunting at a slightly reduced intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. This way, I can avoid overexertion and increase my chances of survival in a competitive environment.",

A theta of 0.60 allows me to hunt effectively without risking too much energy, considering the competition from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests competition is high, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to unnecessary risks. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still taking advantage of the available prey.",
