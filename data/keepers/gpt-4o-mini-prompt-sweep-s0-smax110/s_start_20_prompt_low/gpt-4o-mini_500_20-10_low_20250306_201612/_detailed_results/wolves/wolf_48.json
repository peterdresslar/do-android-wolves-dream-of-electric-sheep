            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the increase in the wolf population means competition for food is higher. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and with 39.58 sheep available, I can afford to increase my hunting intensity without risking overexertion. A theta of 0.50 allows me to balance the need for food while conserving energy, especially since the number of wolves has remained stable. This way, I can ensure my survival while still being cautious.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can maximize my chances of catching enough prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With an increase in the wolf population, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential failure. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my intensity to 0.75, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating less food availability. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy while still being active enough to hunt when opportunities arise. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population decreasing, I need to increase my hunting intensity to ensure I can secure enough food for survival. However, I don",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the wolf population is also declining. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.5, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt. This balanced approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and avoid overexertion, which is crucial for my survival.",
