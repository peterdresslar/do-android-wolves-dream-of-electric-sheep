            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased slightly, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to hunt effectively while still conserving energy for future hunts, as the wolf population remains stable.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the number of wolves, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves for the same prey. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct confrontation, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. With the recent decrease in the wolf population, a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive in securing food. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a more cautious approach. With fewer wolves, I can afford to hunt at a lower intensity to conserve energy and avoid competition with others. This strategy increases my chances of survival while still allowing for successful hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population increasing and the number of wolves remaining the same, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can catch enough food without exhausting myself. A moderate intensity allows me to be efficient while still conserving energy for future hunts.",

However, with the recent decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still compete with others while not overexerting myself. A theta of 0.65 allows me to take advantage of the available prey without risking too much energy.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and I want to increase my chances of a successful hunt without overexerting myself. By raising my intensity slightly from my previous level, I can take advantage of the available prey while still conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased slightly, indicating a potential scarcity of food.
