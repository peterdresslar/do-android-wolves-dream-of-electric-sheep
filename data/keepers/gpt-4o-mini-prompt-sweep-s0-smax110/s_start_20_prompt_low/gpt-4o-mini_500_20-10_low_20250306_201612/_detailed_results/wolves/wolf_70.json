By increasing my intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion and competition with other wolves. This way, I can still hunt effectively while conserving energy for future needs.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, and the number of wolves is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves for the dwindling sheep. This strategy allows me to survive longer while waiting for a more favorable situation.",
