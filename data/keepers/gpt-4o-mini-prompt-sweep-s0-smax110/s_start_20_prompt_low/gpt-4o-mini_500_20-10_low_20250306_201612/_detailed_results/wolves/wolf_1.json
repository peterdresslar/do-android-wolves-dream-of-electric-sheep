            "I chose this theta because with 20 sheep and 10 wolves, the competition for food is high. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because with the number of sheep increasing slightly and the wolf population remaining stable, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still taking advantage of the available prey. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a potentially competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, with the recent decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still compete effectively while conserving energy. A theta of 0.65 allows me to take advantage of the sheep while being cautious about the overall competition.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population increasing, there is a potential for a successful hunt without overexerting myself. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation while still being effective in securing food.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased slightly, indicating a stable food source. However, with the number of wolves remaining the same, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food without overexerting myself. A theta of 0.60 allows me to be more efficient while still being competitive."
