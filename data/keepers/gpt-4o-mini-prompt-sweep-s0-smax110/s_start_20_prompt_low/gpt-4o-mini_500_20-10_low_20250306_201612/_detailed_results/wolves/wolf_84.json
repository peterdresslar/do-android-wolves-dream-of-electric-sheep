            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. This balance increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and I want to balance my energy expenditure with the need to hunt effectively. By increasing my intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the current sheep numbers while still conserving some energy for future hunts, especially since the wolf population has remained stable.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival as the competition remains steady with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at full intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because with the number of sheep increasing and wolves remaining the same, I can afford to hunt at a moderate intensity. This allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success. A lower intensity also reduces the risk of overexertion and potential injury, ensuring my survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because with the number of sheep decreasing and the wolf population remaining stable, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still secure enough food while avoiding overexertion. A theta of 0.70 allows me to hunt effectively without risking depletion of resources or attracting too much attention from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting may be less successful. By reducing my intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, allowing me to adapt to the current situation and ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of successfully hunting while still conserving energy. This balance is crucial for my survival, especially with the competition from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and increase my chances of survival while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This balanced approach allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased slightly, indicating a good opportunity for hunting. However, with the number of wolves remaining the same, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough prey without exhausting myself or competing too fiercely with other wolves.
