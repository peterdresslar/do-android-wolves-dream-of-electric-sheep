With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. This way, I can avoid direct competition with other wolves and increase my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population decreasing slightly and the number of wolves remaining stable, it\u2019s wise to balance my hunting intensity. A lower theta allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt, ensuring I can survive in case the situation worsens.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can maximize my chances of catching enough food while still conserving energy. This balance is crucial for my survival, especially with other wolves competing for the same resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By reducing my intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. This balance may help me survive longer without overexerting myself, especially since the number of wolves has remained constant.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased slightly, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.65, I can improve my chances of successfully hunting while still conserving energy compared to maximum intensity. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating that food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population decreasing and the number of wolves remaining the same, it's important to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. A slightly lower intensity allows me to adapt to the current situation and avoid overexertion, which could be detrimental if food remains scarce.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting may be less rewarding. By increasing my intensity slightly from my previous 0.60, I can take advantage of the remaining sheep while still being cautious about overexerting myself in a potentially scarce environment. This balance helps ensure my survival while adapting to the current situation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means food is becoming scarcer. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.5, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This balanced approach helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means hunting intensity needs to be higher to ensure I can catch enough food. However, I also want to conserve energy and avoid overexertion, especially since the number of wolves hasn't changed. A theta of 0.70 strikes a balance between being competitive and maintaining my stamina.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By lowering my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy while still being active enough to catch prey when opportunities arise. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and with fewer prey, hunting at maximum intensity may lead to wasted energy and increased competition with other wolves. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise."
