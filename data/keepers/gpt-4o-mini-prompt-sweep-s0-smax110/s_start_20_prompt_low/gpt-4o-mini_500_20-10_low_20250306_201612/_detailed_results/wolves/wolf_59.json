            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to overexploitation of the remaining sheep. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and ensure a sustainable food source while also adapting to the declining wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased slightly, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion, ensuring I remain competitive with other wolves while also conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the number of wolves, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves for the same prey. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct confrontation, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in the wolf population suggests competition for food is increasing. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can balance the need to secure food while conserving energy and avoiding overexertion, which is crucial for my survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in the wolf population suggests increased competition for food. By raising my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of successfully hunting sheep while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population increasing and the number of wolves remaining constant, a slightly lower hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment."
