With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and reduce competition for food. This way, I can still hunt effectively while ensuring my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means food is becoming scarcer. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to survive longer in a challenging environment.",

By lowering my intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. This balance allows me to adapt to the current situation and increase my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my intensity to 0.75, I can improve my chances of catching enough food while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive pack.",
