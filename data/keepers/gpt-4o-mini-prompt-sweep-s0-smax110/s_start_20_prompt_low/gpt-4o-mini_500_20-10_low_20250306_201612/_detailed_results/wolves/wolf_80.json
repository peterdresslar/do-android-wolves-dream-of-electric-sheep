This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",

This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",

            "I chose this theta because with the decrease in the wolf population, it is crucial to balance the hunting intensity to ensure I can still secure enough food while avoiding overexertion. A slightly higher intensity will help me take advantage of the increased sheep population without risking too much competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because with a stable number of wolves and an increase in sheep, a slightly lower hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive. This way, I can avoid overexertion and increase my chances of survival in a potentially crowded hunting scenario.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, indicating more food availability. However, with the number of wolves remaining the same, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can secure enough food while also not overexerting myself. A theta of 0.75 allows me to hunt effectively without risking depletion of my energy reserves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased slightly, indicating a stable food source. With the number of wolves remaining the same, I can afford to hunt at a slightly lower intensity while still ensuring I have enough energy for future hunts. This balance allows me to conserve energy and avoid overexertion.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population increasing and the number of wolves remaining constant, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a potentially competitive environment.",
