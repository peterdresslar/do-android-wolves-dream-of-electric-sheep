This balance will help ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy while still allowing for some hunting. This balance increases my chances of survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and with the number of wolves remaining constant, I can afford to increase my hunting intensity slightly. This will help me secure enough food while still being cautious, as overhunting could lead to a decline in sheep and ultimately threaten my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the wolf population has increased. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",

            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a more competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can better ensure my survival while still being mindful of the dwindling prey. This balance allows me to hunt effectively without overexerting myself, considering the recent trends.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, and with fewer sheep, hunting at maximum intensity may lead to competition with other wolves for limited resources. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
