            "I chose this theta because with an increase in the wolf population, competition for food will be higher. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can better ensure my survival while still being cautious not to overexert myself, given the current sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and I need to increase my hunting intensity to ensure I can secure enough food. With more wolves around, competition is fierce, and a higher theta will improve my chances of a successful hunt without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy while still allowing for some hunting. This balance increases my chances of survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, and with more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to overexploitation of the remaining sheep. A lower intensity allows for a sustainable approach, ensuring I can survive longer while still contributing to the pack's needs.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is increasing. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a potentially scarce environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting may be more challenging. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of securing food while still conserving energy, as the wolves' population remains stable. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",

By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while conserving energy, as the competition among wolves is still present. This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and the recent decrease in wolves suggests that competition for food is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
