By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and increases my chances of survival without risking depletion of resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting, but the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition is less intense. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy while still taking advantage of the available prey, ensuring my survival in a fluctuating environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, with the number of wolves remaining the same, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I have enough energy for future hunts while still being competitive. A theta of 0.60 allows me to take advantage of the increased sheep while conserving energy.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. By increasing my intensity to 0.75, I can take advantage of the higher number of sheep while still conserving some energy for future hunts, ensuring my survival in a competitive environment.",
