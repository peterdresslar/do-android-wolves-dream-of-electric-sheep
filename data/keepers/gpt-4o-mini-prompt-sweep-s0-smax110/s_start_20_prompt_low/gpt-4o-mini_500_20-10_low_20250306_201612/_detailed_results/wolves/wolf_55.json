With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy while still allowing for opportunistic hunting. This balance increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating less food availability. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competing too aggressively with other wolves, which may lead to better survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy, as I don",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can improve my chances of catching enough prey while still conserving energy. This balance is crucial for my survival, especially with the competition from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the population of sheep is decreasing, and with fewer sheep, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to overexertion and potential starvation. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's survival. This approach allows me to adapt to the current situation and ensure my own survival as the competition among wolves increases.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, but the wolf population has also decreased. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.40, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still taking advantage of the available prey. This strategy allows me to survive longer without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and with fewer sheep available, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to overexertion and potential failure. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival as the competition among wolves grows.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with fewer wolves around, I can afford to hunt at a moderate intensity. This allows me to conserve energy while still increasing my chances of a successful hunt, ensuring my survival without overexerting myself."
