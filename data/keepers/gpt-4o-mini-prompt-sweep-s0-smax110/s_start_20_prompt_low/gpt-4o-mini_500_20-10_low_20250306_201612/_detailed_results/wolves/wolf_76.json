By increasing my hunting intensity, I can better secure my share of the dwindling sheep population while still being mindful of the risks of overexertion. A moderate increase allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics without exhausting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity. By reducing my intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt, ensuring my survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a less aggressive hunting approach. By reducing my intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still maintaining a chance to catch prey.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing more food availability. However, the number of wolves remains the same, which means competition for food is still present. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly to 0.40, I can take advantage of the higher sheep numbers while still being cautious about overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased slightly, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion. This allows me to remain competitive with other wolves while conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased slightly, indicating that hunting may be less rewarding. By increasing my intensity slightly from my previous theta, I can take advantage of the remaining sheep while still being cautious, as the wolf population remains stable. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food.
