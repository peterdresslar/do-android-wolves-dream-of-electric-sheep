            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual adjustment is necessary to maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that can support wolf reproduction while preventing over-depletion of the sheep. This adjustment reflects a balance between maintaining our wolf population and ensuring the sheep can recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 49.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, the wolf population is relatively high, so a moderate approach will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep too quickly. This adjustment allows for gradual hunting while also considering the need for wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 38.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both populations can thrive. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, promoting a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.28, which is only 29.3% of its maximum capacity. While I want to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A moderate decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, allowing both populations to stabilize without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.33, which is only 23.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still being mindful of the need to avoid overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.10, which is only 18.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is some opportunity for hunting, it is essential to maintain a balance to allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease from my previous theta of 0.45 will help reduce pressure on the sheep while still allowing for some hunting to support the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.87, which is only 15.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the balance needed for both species",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.67, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.09, which is only 11.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A slight decrease from my previous theta of 0.400 will help balance our needs without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we are competing for limited resources. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining our own numbers. This gradual approach will help ensure long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.39, which is only 10.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting without risking the sheep",

This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.53, which is only 9.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting approach. A theta of 0.35 reflects a slight increase in hunting intensity compared to my previous value, acknowledging the need to balance the wolf population while being cautious not to deplete the sheep further.",

This indicates that there is room for gradual hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.41, which is only 9.5% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population, I will focus on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting.
