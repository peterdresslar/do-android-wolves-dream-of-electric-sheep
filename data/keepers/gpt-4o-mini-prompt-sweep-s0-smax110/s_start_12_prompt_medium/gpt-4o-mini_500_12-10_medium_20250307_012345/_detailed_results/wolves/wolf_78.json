            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderate to allow for recovery while still ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. A slight increase from my previous theta reflects a cautious approach to capitalize on the current abundance of sheep without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to depletion of their numbers. By focusing on competing with other wolves, I can allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that we should be cautious with our hunting to avoid depleting their numbers too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support our wolf population while still prioritizing the sustainability of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover and prevent over-depletion. This lower theta will help maintain a balance while still considering the competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that we should be cautious with our hunting to avoid depleting their numbers too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that acknowledges the need for wolf reproduction while still being mindful of the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and a slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain the balance without depleting the sheep too quickly. This adjustment allows for sustainable coexistence while also supporting the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high at 103, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. A moderate increase to 0.45 reflects a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability while still allowing for wolf population growth.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 84.2% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate hunting approach. This will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations while avoiding overhunting. As the wolf population is also growing, a slight reduction in hunting intensity will support sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 78.30, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment reflects a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while ensuring that the sheep population can sustain itself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 57.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population being slightly higher than the sheep population, a moderate approach is necessary to avoid over-depletion of the sheep. This theta allows for a slight increase in hunting while still prioritizing the long-term balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level relative to its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity slightly to allow the sheep to recover while still competing with other wolves. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery. A gradual increase is essential to avoid depleting the sheep population too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 30.82, which is only 28.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level (22.1% of maximum capacity), and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. By adopting a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem."
