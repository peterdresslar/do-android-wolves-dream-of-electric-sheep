            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 57.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. This moderate approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species and avoids depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. Given the current wolf population, a slight increase in hunting intensity will help support wolf reproduction while still allowing for the sheep to recover. This adjustment is gradual, aligning with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the wolf population is relatively high. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow sheep to recover while still enabling wolves to thrive. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance without risking a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 30.82, which is only 28.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I can increase hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.26, which is only 22.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing our own population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our needs without depleting the sheep further, promoting a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.85, which is only 18.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is an opportunity to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A gradual increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without risking a severe depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.04, which is only 15.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population and maintaining a balance with the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the wolf population is relatively high. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help sustain our population while allowing the sheep to recover gradually. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoids sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.55, which is only 12.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still focusing on the competition with other wolves, ensuring a balance that promotes long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the wolf population is relatively high. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep to recover while maintaining our pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low at 11.86, which indicates that we should be cautious about hunting intensity to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for wolves to thrive. This adjustment reflects the current low sheep-to-wolf ratio and aims to prevent over-depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.43, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a potential strain on resources. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing competition with other wolves. This approach aligns with my objective of ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.20, which is only 10.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.300 to 0.350, I can maintain a balance between hunting and allowing the sheep population to stabilize, while also considering the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.08, which is only 10.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without risking the sheep population",

To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity slightly to allow the sheep to recover.
