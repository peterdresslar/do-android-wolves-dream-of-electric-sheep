            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 68, which is relatively high, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves while allowing the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize both populations and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 38.62, which is only 35.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some reproduction among wolves while still enabling the sheep population to recover. A moderate increase from my previous theta of 0.25 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 30.82, which is only 28.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I can increase my hunting intensity slightly, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A small increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, enabling sustainable coexistence while still addressing the needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.26, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we are nearing a critical point for sustainability. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while still competing effectively with other wolves. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.85, which is only 18.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is an opportunity to hunt, I need to be cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach that supports both hunting and the recovery of the sheep population, while also considering the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.04, which is only 15.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more conservative approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting to support the wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.02, which is only 13.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of the wolf population.",
