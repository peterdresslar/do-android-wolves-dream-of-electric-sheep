            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that we should moderate our hunting to allow for recovery. A balanced approach will help sustain both our population and the sheep, preventing depletion while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. By reducing hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover and maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem. This approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both species while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be cautiously increased to prevent over-depletion. However, given the current wolf population and the need to maintain balance, a small increase from my previous theta allows for sustainable hunting while still considering the long-term health of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and hunting more aggressively could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that a slight increase in hunting intensity is appropriate to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 95.85, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while maintaining a sustainable balance with the sheep population, which is currently at 87.1% of its maximum capacity. A gradual increase aligns with the wisdom of adapting to changing conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still maintaining a healthy sheep population. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the trends in both populations, a balanced approach will promote coexistence without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently healthy at 67.55, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while avoiding over-depletion of the sheep. This balance helps maintain both populations sustainably.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 37.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 69.00, a moderate hunting intensity will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep can recover. This adjustment allows for sustainable coexistence while avoiding overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.75, which is only 28.9% of its maximum capacity. While I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 23.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for recovery. With a wolf population of 65, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is low, suggesting that we should focus on competition among wolves rather than aggressive hunting. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.62, which is only 18.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of the wolf pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.66, which is only 16.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support our wolf population while also giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, promoting a sustainable balance."
