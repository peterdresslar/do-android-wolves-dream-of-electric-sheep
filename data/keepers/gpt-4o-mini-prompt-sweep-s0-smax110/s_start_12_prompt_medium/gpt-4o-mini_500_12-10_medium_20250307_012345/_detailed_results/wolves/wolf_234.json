            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 265\n- Sheep population: 11.78\n- Wolf population: 42.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.350\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.28 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 10.7% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A gradual increase in theta will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population remains sustainable.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing sheep to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 93.34, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring both populations can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain our wolf population while still enabling the sheep to recover and maintain balance in the ecosystem. A gradual adjustment is key to avoiding any drastic impacts on either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a balanced approach. With the sheep-to-wolf ratio close to 1, maintaining a moderate hunting intensity will help ensure both populations can thrive without depleting the sheep too quickly. This adjustment allows for gradual adaptation to the current conditions while keeping an eye on future trends.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.70, it is important to maintain a balance that allows both populations to thrive. A slight decrease from my previous theta of 0.50 will help ensure that I do not over-hunt while still allowing for some hunting to support the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.99, which is only 32.7% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.74, which is only 25.2% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.40 will help maintain balance and avoid sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.26, which is only 19.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for sheep recovery while also considering the growing wolf population. A slight decrease from my previous theta of 0.45 will help maintain a balance and avoid over-depletion of sheep, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.37, which is only 15.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our needs without depleting the sheep further, promoting a balance that can lead to long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I need to maintain a balance to ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, a slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted to support wolf reproduction. However, I must be cautious not to overhunt, as the sheep population is still recovering.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.10, which is only 11.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are struggling, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to recover while still enabling my pack to compete effectively with other wolves. A gradual approach will help maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.78, which is only 10.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, ensuring long-term sustainability for both populations."
