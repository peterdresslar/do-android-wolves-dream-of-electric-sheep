            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently healthy, and I want to gradually increase my hunting intensity to ensure the wolf population can thrive without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for sustainable coexistence while still being mindful of the growing wolf numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 82.4% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 50, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure sustainable coexistence. A gradual increase to 0.45 allows for a balanced approach that supports both reproduction and the recovery of sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can continue to thrive without being overly depleted. A gradual increase in theta reflects the need to balance our immediate hunting needs with the long-term health of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the wolf population is relatively high. A moderate theta allows for continued hunting while also giving sheep a chance to recover and ensuring that the wolf population does not deplete the sheep too quickly. This balance supports long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while it is beneficial to hunt, I need to be cautious as the wolf population is relatively high. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still ensuring the wolves can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level relative to the maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining enough pressure to support wolf reproduction. This moderate approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species."
