            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low relative to the maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 11.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.40, it is important to maintain a balance to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A moderate increase to 0.55 allows for some hunting while still considering the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.31, which is only 12.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is an opportunity to hunt, I should be cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still giving sheep a chance to recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while it is beneficial to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep too quickly. A moderate adjustment allows for a balance between competing with other wolves and maintaining a healthy sheep population."
