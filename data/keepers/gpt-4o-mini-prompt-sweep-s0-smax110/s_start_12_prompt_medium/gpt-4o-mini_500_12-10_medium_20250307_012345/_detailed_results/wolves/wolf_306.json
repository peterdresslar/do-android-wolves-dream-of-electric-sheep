            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while still maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 87.7% of maximum capacity, allowing for some hunting without risking depletion. However, with the wolf population at 46, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 75.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.51, it is prudent to maintain a moderate hunting intensity to ensure sustainable coexistence while also allowing for some competition among wolves. This slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that supports both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still maintaining a balance that prevents over-depletion of the sheep. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the trends in both populations, a gradual increase is prudent to ensure long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance of the ecosystem. This adjustment will help maintain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still ensuring that the sheep population can recover and thrive. A gradual increase is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 29.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.47, it is important to maintain a balance that allows both populations to thrive. A slight reduction from my previous theta of 0.45 will help ensure that we do not overhunt while still allowing for some hunting to support our wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.33, which is only 23.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for moderate hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still considering the long-term balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.10, which is only 18.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight reduction from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, enabling the sheep to recover while still allowing for some hunting to support the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.87, which is only 15.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.67, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without risking over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.09, which is only 11.9% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.99, which is only 10.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and promotes long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.39, which is only 10.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a slight increase in hunting intensity is appropriate to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A gradual increase to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting."
