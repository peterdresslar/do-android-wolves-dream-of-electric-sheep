            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that they are thriving. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 6.47, there is still a significant number of sheep available for hunting. By setting theta at 0.6, I can maintain a balanced approach that allows for sustainable hunting while avoiding over-depletion of the sheep population. This adjustment also considers the need to gradually reduce hunting intensity as the wolf population grows.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A balanced approach will help maintain the sheep population while ensuring the wolf pack remains healthy and sustainable.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. A lower theta will help balance the competition among wolves while ensuring the sheep population can stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that we should be cautious about hunting intensity to avoid depleting their numbers. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 3.79, it is crucial to focus on competition among wolves to prevent overhunting and ensure long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and while I want to increase hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that considers both the current sheep population and the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while ensuring that the sheep can recover. This moderate adjustment helps maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and hunting, promoting the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 93.34, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual increase is necessary to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly, as we need to balance our needs with the ecosystem",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight reduction in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a balance between the wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term survival for both. By keeping the theta at 0.50, I can adapt to the current conditions while avoiding overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.99, which is only 32.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for some hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.74, which is only 25.2% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A moderate increase from my previous theta of 0.400 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.26, which is only 19.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight decrease in theta allows for a balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still enabling some hunting to support reproduction. This strategy promotes long-term sustainability for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.37, which is only 15.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need to compete with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population. This gradual adjustment will help ensure the long-term survival of both species."
