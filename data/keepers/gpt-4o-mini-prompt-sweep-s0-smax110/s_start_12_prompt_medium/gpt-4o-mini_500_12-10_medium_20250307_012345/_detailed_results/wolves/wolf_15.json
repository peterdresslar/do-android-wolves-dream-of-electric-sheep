This suggests that there is room for increased hunting intensity without risking immediate depletion. However, given the current wolf population of 65.00, I need to be cautious and avoid over-hunting. A slight increase to 0.40 allows for sustainable hunting while still considering the need for balance and the long-term health of both populations."
