            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at its maximum capacity, and while I need to maintain a healthy wolf population, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A moderate hunting intensity will help sustain both populations without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution in hunting to prevent depletion. A moderate approach allows for some hunting while still considering the long-term health of both sheep and wolves. This adjustment reflects a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sustainability of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. By adopting a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to recover while maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high at 103, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a sustainable balance. This adjustment will help support the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A gradual increase is prudent to avoid sudden population crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 84.2% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help ensure the wolf population remains healthy without depleting the sheep too quickly. A moderate approach allows for sustainable coexistence as both populations adapt to current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a sustainable balance. This adjustment reflects the need to support wolf reproduction without over-depleting the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 57.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.99, it is important to maintain a balance that allows both populations to thrive. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will help ensure the sheep can recover while still allowing for some hunting to support the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help sustain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover and maintain balance in the ecosystem.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity to ensure the survival of my pack, I must also be cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that supports both wolf reproduction and sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.26, which is only 22.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while also focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring that both populations can recover sustainably.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.85, which is only 18.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.04, which is only 15.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack without depleting the sheep further, promoting a more balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.02, which is only 13.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to allow for some recovery of the sheep population while still ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without risking a crash in the sheep population."
