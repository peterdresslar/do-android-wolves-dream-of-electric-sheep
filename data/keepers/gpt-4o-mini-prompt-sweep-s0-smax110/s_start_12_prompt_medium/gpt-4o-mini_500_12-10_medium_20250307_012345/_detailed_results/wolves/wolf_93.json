            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution in hunting to prevent depletion. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while also considering the growth of the wolf population, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at its maximum capacity, and a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while also reducing competition among wolves. This approach supports long-term sustainability and prevents overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, which suggests that a slight increase in hunting intensity is appropriate to maintain balance. However, I must be cautious and avoid drastic changes, as the wolf population is still relatively low. A moderate increase allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some recovery for the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 103, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while ensuring sustainability. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to balance hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 84.2% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 47, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 78.30, which is 71.2% of its maximum capacity. While I want to ensure the wolf population thrives, I also need to allow the sheep to recover and maintain a balance. A slight decrease from my previous theta of 0.450 will help reduce hunting intensity while still allowing for some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 68, which is relatively high, I need to be cautious about over-hunting. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing competition among wolves, ensuring that both populations can stabilize and thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain the balance between wolf and sheep populations while ensuring that we do not over-deplete the sheep resources. A gradual increase aligns with the current trends and allows for adaptation to future changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 28.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 67.00, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still considering the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.26, which is only 22.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is an opportunity to hunt, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.85, which is only 18.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased slightly to support wolf reproduction, it is essential to prioritize the recovery of the sheep population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, ensuring that we do not deplete the sheep further while still competing effectively with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.04, which is only 15.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly, aligning with the wisdom of making gradual adjustments.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.02, which is only 13.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring a balance that supports both populations in the long term."
