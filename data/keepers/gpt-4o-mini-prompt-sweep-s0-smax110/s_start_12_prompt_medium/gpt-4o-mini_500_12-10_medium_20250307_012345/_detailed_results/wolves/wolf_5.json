This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",

While I want to ensure the wolves can reproduce, I also need to allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, allowing both populations to thrive without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.31, which is only 12.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A moderate increase from my previous theta of 0.400 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
