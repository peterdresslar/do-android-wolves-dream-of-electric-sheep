            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69.00, I need to be cautious not to overhunt, as this could lead to a decline in both populations. A moderate increase in theta allows for effective hunting while still considering the long-term health of both sheep and wolves.",
