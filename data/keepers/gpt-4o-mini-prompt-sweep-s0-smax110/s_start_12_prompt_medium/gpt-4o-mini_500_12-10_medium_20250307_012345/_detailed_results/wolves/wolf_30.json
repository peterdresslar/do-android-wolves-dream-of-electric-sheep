            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 4.58, it is essential to focus on competition among wolves rather than aggressive hunting to ensure long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance while still considering the need to compete with other wolves. This approach supports both the wolf population and the sustainability of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be cautiously increased to allow for some population growth while avoiding over-depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction without risking a crash in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity to ensure the wolf population thrives, I must do so gradually to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach that supports both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is close to its maximum capacity, indicating a need for cautious hunting to prevent depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the sustainability of the sheep population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 95.85, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to maintain balance, considering the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need to avoid overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still healthy at 83.41, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 54.00, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure sustainability. A moderate increase to 0.45 reflects a balanced approach that supports both wolf reproduction and sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment reflects the need to balance the growing wolf population while ensuring the sheep can recover and thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 48.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 68, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 37.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 69, it is wise to maintain a moderate hunting intensity to allow both populations to stabilize. This theta value reflects a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.75, which is only 28.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I need to maintain some hunting to support wolf reproduction, I should also be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that supports both populations without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.28, which is only 23.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is an opportunity to hunt, I must be cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for sustainable hunting while still focusing on the competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.62, which is only 18.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for the sheep to recover. By setting a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This approach aligns with my objective of ensuring long-term survival for both species while avoiding overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.66, which is only 16.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some replenishment of the sheep population while still maintaining a focus on the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.20, which is only 13.8% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, it"
