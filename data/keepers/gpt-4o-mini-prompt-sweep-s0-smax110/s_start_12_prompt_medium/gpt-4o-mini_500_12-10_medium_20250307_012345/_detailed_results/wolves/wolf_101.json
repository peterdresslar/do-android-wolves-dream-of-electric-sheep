            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover rather than intensifying hunting. A lower theta will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem while we compete with other wolves, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that they can sustain a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. A gradual increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the long-term health of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is healthy and close to its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population also present, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 84.2% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance. This adjustment will help maintain the wolf population without over-depleting the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still maintaining a balance with the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but with the wolf population also being high, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 68, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while it is beneficial to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must also consider the growing wolf population. A moderate adjustment allows for a balanced approach that supports both species without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 30.82, which is only 28.0% of its maximum capacity. While I need to focus on hunting to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.26, which is only 22.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is potential for recovery if I reduce hunting intensity slightly. By adjusting theta to 0.40, I can focus on maintaining a balance that allows for sustainable coexistence while still ensuring that the wolf population remains healthy.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.85, which is only 18% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover while still ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 reflects a balanced strategy, focusing on competition with other wolves while allowing for some hunting to maintain our population dynamics.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.04, which is only 15.5% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase in hunting intensity to 0.40 will help maintain a balance, allowing for some reproduction among wolves while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.02, which is only 13.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for the sheep to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus more on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.55, which is only 12.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly."
