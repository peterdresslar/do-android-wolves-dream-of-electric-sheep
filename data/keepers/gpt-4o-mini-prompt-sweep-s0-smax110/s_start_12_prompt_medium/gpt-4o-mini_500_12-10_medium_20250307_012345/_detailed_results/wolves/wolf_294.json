            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. By slightly increasing my theta from the previous value, I can maintain a balance that supports both the wolf population and the sheep, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 4.07, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and my previous low hunting intensity has allowed for some recovery. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I will maintain a cautious approach, allowing sheep to stabilize while also considering the gradual increase in wolf numbers. This moderate theta will help balance competition with other wolves and sustainable hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that a slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted to maintain balance. However, given the current wolf population and the need to avoid over-depleting the sheep, a moderate increase allows for sustainable coexistence while still focusing on competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 96.42, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while maintaining a sustainable balance. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight reduction in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a balance between the wolf and sheep populations, ensuring the long-term survival of both. By adjusting theta downwards, I can focus more on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, which will help sustain the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment reflects the need to support wolf reproduction without over-depleting the sheep population, ensuring long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, and while it is beneficial to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must also consider the growing wolf population. A theta of 0.40 allows for a balanced approach that promotes coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.28, which is only 29.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is some opportunity for hunting, it is crucial to maintain a balance to allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease from my previous theta of 0.450 will help reduce pressure on the sheep while still allowing for some hunting to support the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.33, which is only 23.0% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A moderate increase from my previous theta of 0.400 helps maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.10, which is only 18.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting for the wolves. A theta of 0.35 strikes a balance between competing with other wolves and maintaining a sustainable sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.87, which is only 15.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for more hunting intensity while still focusing on the long-term survival of both species. This adjustment reflects the need to respond to the current conditions while avoiding drastic changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.67, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, it"
