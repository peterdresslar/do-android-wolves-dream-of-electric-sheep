            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 75.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.51, it is essential to focus on competition with other wolves to prevent overhunting. A gradual increase from my previous theta allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate approach will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term survival for both.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 49.5% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term survival for both.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment reflects a balance between ensuring the wolf population can thrive while still allowing sheep to recover and maintain their numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.28, which is only 29.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is an opportunity to increase hunting, it is essential to be cautious and avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight reduction from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still enabling some hunting to support reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.33, which is only 23.0% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A moderate adjustment helps maintain balance as both populations are interconnected.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.10, which is only 18.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.87, which is only 15.3% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance, allowing for some hunting while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.67, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for the sheep to recover, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to bounce back while still enabling the wolf population to compete with each other. Gradually adjusting my theta downwards helps maintain a balance and avoids over-depleting the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.09, which is only 11.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased slightly, it is crucial to maintain a balance to allow the sheep population to recover. A moderate increase to 0.40 reflects a cautious approach, allowing for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we need to be cautious with our hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.80, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while still competing with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.53, which is only 9.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for gradual hunting without risking the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.39, which is only 9.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing our need for sustenance with the necessity of preserving the sheep for future cycles.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.54, which is only 9.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 will help balance the need for wolf survival while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.82, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is an opportunity to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A gradual increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, avoiding overexploitation of the sheep."
