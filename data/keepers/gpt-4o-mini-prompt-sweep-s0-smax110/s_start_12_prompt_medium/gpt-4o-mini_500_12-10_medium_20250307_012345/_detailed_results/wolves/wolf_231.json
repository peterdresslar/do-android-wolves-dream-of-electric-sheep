            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderate to allow for recovery. This value allows for a slight increase in hunting while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep, avoiding overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 93.34, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to maintain balance, considering the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need to avoid overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction without overly depleting the sheep population, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while we can increase our hunting intensity slightly, it's important to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A moderate approach allows for coexistence and ensures that both populations can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population also being relatively high, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A small adjustment towards more hunting will help maintain our population while ensuring the sheep can recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we are nearing a critical point for sustainable hunting. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling our wolf population to thrive. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.74, which is only 25.2% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.40 aligns with the wisdom of making small adjustments to maintain balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.26, which is only 19.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting without risking depletion. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a more cautious approach, focusing on maintaining a balance while still enabling some hunting to support wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.37, which is only 15.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.83, which is only 13.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to allow for recovery. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.10, which is only 11.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a more balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need to compete with other wolves."
