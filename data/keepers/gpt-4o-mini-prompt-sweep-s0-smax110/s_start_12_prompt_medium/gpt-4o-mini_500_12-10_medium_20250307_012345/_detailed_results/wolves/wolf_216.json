Maintaining a lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, preventing overexploitation of the sheep population while we focus on competing with other wolves.",

Maintaining a focus on competition with other wolves is essential to ensure our population remains stable while the sheep can gradually recover.",

Maintaining a lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep while allowing for gradual adjustments in the future.",

With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 5.24, it is crucial to focus on competition among wolves rather than aggressive hunting, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be cautiously increased to prevent over-depletion. However, given the current wolf population and the need to maintain balance, a slight increase from my previous theta allows for sustainable coexistence while still being mindful of the potential for future growth in both populations.",

A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of sheep and maintaining a balance with the wolf population.",

This adjustment allows for a sustainable coexistence while also supporting the wolf population",

This moderate adjustment helps maintain a balance between our needs and the sustainability of the ecosystem, allowing for gradual adaptation as conditions change.",

A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain balance as the wolf population is close to the sheep population, ensuring we do not over-deplete our prey.",

However, with the wolf population at 69.00, I need to be cautious not to overhunt and deplete the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for more hunting while still maintaining a balance that supports both populations.",
