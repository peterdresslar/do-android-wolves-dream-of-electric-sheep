            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that they can sustain some hunting pressure without immediate risk of depletion. However, with a relatively high wolf population, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight increase in hunting intensity allows for reproduction while still considering the long-term balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and while I want to maintain a healthy wolf population, I also need to ensure that the sheep can recover. A moderate hunting intensity allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still healthy at 92.9% of maximum capacity, allowing for a balanced approach. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 2.49, I can afford to maintain a moderate hunting intensity to ensure both populations can thrive without depleting the sheep too quickly. This adjustment allows for gradual adaptation to the current conditions while keeping an eye on future trends.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 82.2% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 50, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual increase is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that while there are enough sheep to sustain some hunting, the wolf population is also significant. A theta of 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting to support wolf reproduction. This gradual adjustment helps avoid depleting the sheep population too quickly and allows for recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 41.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a wolf population of 69, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is low, suggesting that we should focus on maintaining a balance rather than increasing hunting intensity. A slight decrease in theta allows for some hunting while prioritizing the recovery of sheep and avoiding overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still considering the long-term health of the sheep population. A gradual increase aligns with the current trends and maintains balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.59, which is only 25.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to allow for recovery. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the competition with other wolves, ensuring that both populations can stabilize and thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.17, which is only 20.2% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.35 helps maintain balance and allows for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.38, which is only 16.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population and maintaining a balance with the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and my previous theta was already on the lower end. A slight increase to 0.40 allows for a more balanced approach to hunting while still being cautious about the sheep's recovery. This adjustment acknowledges the need to support the wolf population without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.90, which is only 12.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for wolf population maintenance while giving sheep a chance to rebound.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.79, which is only 11.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly."
