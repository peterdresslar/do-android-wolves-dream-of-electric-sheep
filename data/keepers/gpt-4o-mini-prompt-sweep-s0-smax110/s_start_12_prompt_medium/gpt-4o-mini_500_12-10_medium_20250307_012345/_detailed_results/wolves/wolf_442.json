            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 102.21, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This value reflects a balanced approach, enabling us to maintain our wolf population while ensuring the sheep can recover and thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 82.4% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain the balance between wolf and sheep populations while ensuring our pack can thrive without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 56.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population slightly higher than the sheep population, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.70, it indicates that we need to be cautious about hunting intensity. A slight reduction in theta allows for competition among wolves while still enabling the sheep population to recover, ensuring long-term balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover and thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A slight decrease from my previous theta will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can stabilize and grow.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.01, which is only 20% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I can increase hunting intensity, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate increase to 0.35 allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring a balance that supports both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.26, which is only 16.6% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still being cautious. A moderate increase to 0.40 will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can recover over time.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.60, which is only 14.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a slight hunting intensity. This moderate adjustment will help balance the needs of both populations without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.78, which is only 12.5% of its maximum capacity. Increasing my hunting intensity slightly to 0.40 allows for a more balanced approach, enabling me to take advantage of the current sheep availability while still considering the need for sustainable coexistence. This gradual adjustment helps maintain the health of both the wolf and sheep populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.51, which is only 11.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta reflects a cautious approach to hunting, balancing the need for sustenance with the long-term health of both species.",
