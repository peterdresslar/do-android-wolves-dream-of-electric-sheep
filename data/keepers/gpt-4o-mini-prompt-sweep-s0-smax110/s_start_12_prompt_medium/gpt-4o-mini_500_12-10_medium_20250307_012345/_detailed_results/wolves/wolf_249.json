            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 93.34, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity while ensuring that the sheep can recover. This adjustment maintains a balance between competing with other wolves and hunting, promoting the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 79.54, which allows for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking over-depletion. This adjustment supports my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain the wolf population while still enabling the sheep to recover. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69.00, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to prevent a crash in the sheep population. A moderate theta of 0.55 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level (32.7% of maximum capacity), and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are fewer sheep available per wolf. To ensure the long-term survival of both populations, I need to focus on a balanced approach that allows the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.45 reflects a cautious increase in hunting intensity without overexploiting the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.74, which is only 25.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should maintain a balanced approach to hunting, allowing the sheep to recover while also ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. A theta of 0.40 allows for moderate hunting intensity, which supports sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.26, which is only 19.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.37, which is only 15.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. This will help balance the ecosystem and prevent a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I need to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that considers both the current low sheep population and the need to sustain the wolf pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.10, which is only 11.9% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.78, which is only 10.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to increase, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.12, which is only 10.1% of its maximum capacity. While I need to focus on hunting to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I need to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.24, which is only 9.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By maintaining a moderate hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for sustainable coexistence."
