            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 123\n- Sheep population: 24.26\n- Wolf population: 64.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.400\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.38 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 22.1% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively small. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help maintain balance and prevent overhunting.",

A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring sustainable coexistence.",

To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain balance and prevent overhunting.",

Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both populations.",

Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover while keeping the wolf population stable. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",

Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover and ensures that we do not deplete their numbers too quickly. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both species.",

Maintaining a lower theta will help prevent over-depletion of the sheep while we focus on competing with other wolves. This balance is crucial for long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and a slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance while allowing for some recovery. This adjustment is small enough to avoid sudden impacts on the ecosystem, ensuring both wolves and sheep can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high at 103, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring long-term sustainability.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, but the wolf population is also significant. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to thrive.

This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery. A gradual increase helps maintain balance in the ecosystem.",

A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while also preventing overcompetition among wolves. This approach supports long-term coexistence and avoids sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still being cautious. This adjustment helps maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term survival and avoiding depletion of resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 28.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.46, it is wise to maintain a slightly lower hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment will help ensure the long-term survival of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.26, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate increase will help sustain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover.
