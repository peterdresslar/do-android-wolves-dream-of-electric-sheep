            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. A moderate theta will help maintain a balance, ensuring the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep while preventing overexploitation of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that they can sustain a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population also present, I must be cautious and avoid overhunting. A gradual increase to 0.40 allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still healthy at 102.60, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 90.75, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing sustainability. This moderate adjustment helps maintain balance as the wolf population grows, ensuring we do not over-deplete the sheep resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach, ensuring that we do not over-deplete the sheep while also considering the growth of our own population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 41.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, the wolf population is relatively high, so a moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep too quickly. This adjustment allows for gradual adaptation to the current ecosystem state.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level relative to the maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance while still allowing for some hunting to support the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.19, which is only 23.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still being mindful of the wolf population growth.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.63, which is only 18.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.09, which is only 15.5% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. A gradual increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.63, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.50, which is only 11.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help stabilize the ecosystem and ensure both populations can thrive in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.50, which is only 10.5% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep further."
