            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 61\n- Sheep population: 11.92\n- Wolf population: 35.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.350\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.34 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 10.8% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. A lower theta allows for more competition among wolves, which can help keep our numbers in check while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment helps maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 95.85, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity while ensuring that the sheep can recover. This adjustment reflects a balance between competing with other wolves and maintaining a sustainable sheep population, promoting long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the balance between wolves and sheep. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction without risking over-depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment reflects a balance between ensuring the wolf population can thrive while still allowing the sheep to recover and maintain their numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 48.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 68.00, it is wise to slightly reduce hunting intensity to allow for recovery and prevent over-depletion of sheep. A gradual adjustment helps maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 37.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that supports both wolf reproduction and sheep recovery, while also considering the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.75, which is only 28.9% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.28, which is only 23.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase to 0.45 allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.62, which is only 18.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is an opportunity to hunt, it is crucial to avoid overexploitation to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the long-term balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.66, which is only 16.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. By increasing theta slightly from 0.35 to 0.40, I can intensify hunting just enough to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.20, which is only 13.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to recover while also reducing competition among wolves. A gradual adjustment towards a more balanced approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.78, which is only 12.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should be cautious with our hunting to allow the sheep to recover. However, with a wolf population of 44, we need to ensure that we maintain our numbers as well. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.62, which is only 11.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 to 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.92, which is only 10.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to be cautious with our hunting to allow the sheep to recover. By increasing theta slightly from 0.35 to 0.40, I can maintain a balanced approach that supports both the wolf population and the sheep"
