            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating a need for careful management. While I want to maintain a healthy wolf population, I also recognize the importance of allowing the sheep to recover. A slight decrease from my previous theta will help balance hunting intensity with the need for sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. A moderate theta will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can stabilize, promoting long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. With the wolf population also present, focusing on competition among wolves will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at its maximum capacity, and while I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta will enable some hunting while still prioritizing the balance needed for long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that we can afford to increase our hunting intensity slightly without risking immediate depletion. However, I must remain cautious and avoid drastic changes, as the wolf population is still relatively small. A gradual increase allows for sustainable coexistence while ensuring our pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is close to its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 87.7% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep. This moderate adjustment will help sustain both populations without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while it is beneficial to hunt, I want to ensure that we do not deplete their numbers too quickly. A slight reduction in hunting intensity allows for the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 49.5% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment reflects a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 38.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to prevent a crash. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring both populations can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.28, which is only 29.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to allow for some reproduction among wolves while still enabling the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.33, which is only 23.0% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must prioritize the recovery of the sheep. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, promoting a balance that can lead to sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.10, which is only 18.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain my pack while allowing the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.87, which is only 15.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.67, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly.
