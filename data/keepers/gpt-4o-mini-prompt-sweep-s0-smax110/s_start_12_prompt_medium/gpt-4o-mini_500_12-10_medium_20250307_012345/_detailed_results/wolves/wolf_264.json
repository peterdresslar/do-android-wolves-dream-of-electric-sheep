            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level relative to its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A theta of 0.45 strikes a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.74, which is only 25.2% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.40 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.26, which is only 19.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for more hunting intensity while still being cautious, as the wolf population is relatively high at 65.00. This approach helps maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.37, which is only 15.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack without depleting the sheep further, promoting a healthier balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.83, which is only 13.5% of its maximum capacity.

This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.400 to 0.35, I can maintain a focus on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.78, which is only 10.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while ensuring that the sheep population has a chance to stabilize and grow.",

This suggests that we should be cautious with our hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach, enabling us to maintain our wolf population while still being mindful of the sheep",

To allow the sheep to recover and avoid depleting their numbers further, I will focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting intensively. This approach will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem and ensure the long-term survival of both species.",

This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable, and while I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must prioritize the recovery of the sheep. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.11, which is only 9.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain our wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.12, which is only 9.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from the previous theta of 0.40 to 0.35, I can still maintain some hunting activity while prioritizing the long-term survival of both species. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.23, which is only 9.3% of its maximum capacity.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.47, which is only 9.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By adopting a slightly lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.77, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help create a sustainable balance without depleting the sheep further.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.73, which is only 10.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased slightly to support wolf reproduction, it is crucial to avoid overhunting to allow the sheep population to recover.
