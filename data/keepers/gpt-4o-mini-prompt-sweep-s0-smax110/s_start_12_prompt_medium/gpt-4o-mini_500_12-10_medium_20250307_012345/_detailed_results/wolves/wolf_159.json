            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. A lower theta will help balance the competition among wolves while ensuring the sheep can rebound, promoting long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain balance and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery and prevent depletion. Maintaining a lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep while allowing for gradual adjustments in response to future population changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution in hunting to prevent depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the sustainability of the sheep population. This adjustment reflects a careful response to the current conditions, ensuring both species can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that they can sustain a bit more hunting pressure without risking depletion. However, since the wolf population is also relatively stable, a moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain balance while allowing for gradual adaptation to the changing conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 92.9% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 41.00, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 90.42, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both species. This moderate adjustment helps maintain a balance as the wolf population is stable, and it allows for gradual adaptation to the current conditions without risking a drastic decline in sheep numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly. It reflects a cautious approach to ensure sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while I want to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I also need to allow the sheep to recover. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain balance without risking depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 41.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level relative to the wolf population, indicating a need for caution in hunting. A moderate theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while also enabling the sheep population to recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.59, which is only 25.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while also focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring a balance that supports both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.17, which is only 20.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.38, which is only 16.7% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 reflects a balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to support reproduction without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.98, which is only 14.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the immediate needs of the pack."
