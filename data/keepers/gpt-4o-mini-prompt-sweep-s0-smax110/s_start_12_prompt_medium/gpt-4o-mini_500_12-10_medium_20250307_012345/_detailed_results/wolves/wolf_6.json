            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.00, which is only 10.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on a balanced approach to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for some hunting to support reproduction without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I want to maintain a healthy wolf population, I need to ensure that the sheep can recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow for a more sustainable balance, considering the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need to avoid depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.31, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual increase is prudent given the current dynamics.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.12, which is only 12.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for the sheep to recover, and a lower hunting intensity will allow for their numbers to stabilize while still enabling the wolf population to thrive. Gradually adjusting my hunting intensity will help maintain a balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that sheep can still recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term survival of both species. This moderate adjustment helps maintain balance as the sheep population is recovering, and it allows for gradual adaptation to the changing conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual increase is essential to avoid sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term health of both species. This moderate adjustment will help maintain balance as the sheep population is recovering, and it allows for gradual adaptation to the changing conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively low at 19.93, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports our need to maintain a healthy wolf population while also allowing the sheep to recover gradually. A moderate approach will help sustain both species in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to ensure that both populations can thrive without depleting resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but I want to ensure that we do not deplete their numbers too quickly. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a focus on competition with other wolves, which can help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. This balance is crucial for long-term survival."
