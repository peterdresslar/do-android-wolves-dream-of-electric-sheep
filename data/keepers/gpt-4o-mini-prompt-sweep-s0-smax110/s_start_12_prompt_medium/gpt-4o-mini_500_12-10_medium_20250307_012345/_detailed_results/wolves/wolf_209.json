            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 260\n- Sheep population: 27.74\n- Wolf population: 69.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.350\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.40 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 25.2% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and my previous theta was quite low. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover. A gradual increase in theta will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to rebound, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio, it is crucial to avoid overhunting to ensure the long-term survival of both species. A gradual approach will help maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery and prevent depletion. Maintaining a lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep while allowing for gradual adjustments as conditions change.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderate to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at its maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. With a high sheep-to-wolf ratio, focusing on competition with other wolves will help maintain a sustainable balance without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at its maximum capacity, and maintaining a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover and prevent overexploitation. This approach also helps to stabilize the wolf population by reducing competition among wolves, ensuring our long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at its maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in sheep numbers, jeopardizing the long-term survival of both species. Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover while keeping the wolf population stable.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. With a high sheep-to-wolf ratio and a growing wolf population, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution in hunting to avoid depleting their numbers. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep to recover, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that we should be cautious in our hunting to avoid depleting their numbers too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term balance between our populations.",

Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover and ensures the long-term survival of both species. It also helps to stabilize the wolf population as we adapt to the current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that we should be cautious with our hunting to avoid depleting their numbers too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support our wolf population while still prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both species.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and a slight increase in hunting intensity will allow for some population control while still promoting coexistence. This moderate adjustment helps ensure that the wolf population remains healthy without depleting the sheep too quickly.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 72.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.42, it is essential to maintain a balance to avoid over-depleting the sheep. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will allow for sustainable coexistence while ensuring the wolf population remains healthy.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 57.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. By adopting a moderate hunting intensity, I can ensure that the sheep population has the opportunity to recover while also allowing the wolf population to maintain its health. This balance will help prevent over-depletion of sheep and support sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 69.00, it is wise to maintain a moderate hunting intensity to allow for sustainable coexistence and prevent over-depletion of the sheep. A slight decrease from my previous theta will help balance the needs of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we need to be cautious with our hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring our long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.74, which is only 25.2% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking a rapid depletion of the sheep. By adjusting theta to 0.40, I can maintain a balance that supports both the wolf population and the recovery of sheep, ensuring sustainable coexistence."
