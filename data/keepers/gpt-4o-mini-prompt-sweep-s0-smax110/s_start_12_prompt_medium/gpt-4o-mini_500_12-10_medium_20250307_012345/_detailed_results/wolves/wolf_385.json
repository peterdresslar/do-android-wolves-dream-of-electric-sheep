            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 90.75, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity. This value helps maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring both populations can thrive without depleting resources too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing sustainability. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to ensure both wolf and sheep populations can thrive without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment reflects a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 41.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With the wolf population at 70, I need to be cautious about overhunting, as it could lead to a depletion of sheep and ultimately harm both populations. A slight decrease in hunting intensity allows for a more sustainable balance while still enabling some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.34, which is only 31.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is room for hunting, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach to hunting while still considering the need for sustainable coexistence as the wolf population is relatively high.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.19, which is only 23.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is an opportunity to hunt, I must be cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.63, which is only 18.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is some opportunity for hunting, it is essential to prioritize the recovery of the sheep population to ensure long-term sustainability. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, helping to balance both populations.",

This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. A moderate increase to 0.45 reflects a balanced approach, promoting coexistence and sustainability.",

This indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and allowing the sheep to increase in number, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",

To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. This approach will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.59, which is only 9.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should be cautious with our hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 reflects a small adjustment to balance the need for wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the sustainability of the sheep population.",
