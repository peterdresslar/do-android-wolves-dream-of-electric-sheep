            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing coexistence. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to ensure the sheep can recover and the wolf population remains stable.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual increase is prudent given the current dynamics.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 31.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for gradual hunting without risking depletion. However, with the wolf population at 71, it is wise to maintain a slightly lower hunting intensity to allow for sustainable coexistence and to prevent overcompetition among wolves. This moderate approach will help balance both populations effectively.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.19, which is only 23.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while still enabling the wolf population to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.63, which is only 18.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly."
