A moderate increase in hunting intensity allows for some reproduction among wolves while still giving sheep a chance to recover. This balance supports long-term sustainability.",

A theta of 0.60 allows for a balanced approach that supports wolf reproduction while giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at its maximum capacity, and while I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A moderate hunting intensity will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. A lower theta will help maintain a balance, ensuring the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep while avoiding overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while giving sheep a chance to rebound, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery and prevent depletion. Maintaining a lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep while allowing for gradual adjustments as conditions change.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at its maximum capacity, indicating that we should be cautious with our hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term balance between our populations.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This approach balances the needs of both populations and avoids overexploitation.",

This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still considering the long-term health of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while we can increase our hunting intensity, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a wolf population of 68, it is wise to focus on competition among wolves to ensure our numbers stabilize while allowing the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",

This adjustment will help maintain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 30.82, which is only 28.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the long-term health of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.26, which is only 22.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while also focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring a balance that supports both populations in the long term.",

This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover.
