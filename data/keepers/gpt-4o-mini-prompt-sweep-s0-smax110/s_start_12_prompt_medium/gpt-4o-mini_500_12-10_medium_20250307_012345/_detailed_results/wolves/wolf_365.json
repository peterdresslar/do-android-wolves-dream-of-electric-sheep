            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to prevent depletion. A theta of 0.6 allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while also giving sheep a chance to recover, maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A theta of 0.45 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for some hunting while ensuring the sheep can sustain their numbers and the wolf population can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and while it is important to maintain a healthy wolf population, I need to ensure that the sheep have enough time to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 102.60, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. However, with the wolf population at 42.00, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 82.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep. However, the wolf population is also significant at 51, suggesting that a slight reduction in hunting intensity is prudent to allow for sustainable coexistence. This moderate adjustment will help maintain balance while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still considering the need to maintain a healthy sheep population. A gradual increase is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep. This adjustment reflects the need to maintain a sustainable coexistence as the sheep population is recovering but still below maximum capacity.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 41.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 70, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to prevent a crash in the sheep population. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term health of both populations. This moderate adjustment will help maintain balance as the sheep recover and the wolf population stabilizes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.19, which is only 23.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is an opportunity to hunt, it is crucial to prioritize the recovery of the sheep population to ensure long-term sustainability. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, which is necessary given the current wolf population of 69. This approach helps maintain balance without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.63, which is only 18.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.09, which is only 15.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for wolf reproduction with the sustainability of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.63, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.50, which is only 11.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.40 to 0.35, I can maintain a focus on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring the long-term survival of both species."
