            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and my previous theta was quite low. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover. A gradual increase in theta will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. A lower theta allows for a focus on competition among wolves, which can help maintain our numbers while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be cautiously increased to prevent over-depletion. However, given the current wolf population and the need for sustainable coexistence, a small increase from my previous theta allows for a gradual adjustment while still focusing on competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and a slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance while allowing for some recovery. This adjustment is gradual, ensuring we don",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that sheep can recover if needed.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 93.34, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports both wolf reproduction and sheep recovery. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to ensure sustainable coexistence while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 72.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.42, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, and while it is beneficial to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must also consider the need for sustainable coexistence. A theta of 0.40 allows for a balanced approach that supports both populations without risking a rapid depletion of sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69.00, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to prevent a crash in the sheep population. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for more hunting while still maintaining a balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.99, which is only 32.7% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.74, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking over-depletion. This adjustment supports my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.26, which is only 19.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is some room for hunting, I need to be cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.37, which is only 15.8% of its maximum capacity. A lower theta allows for a focus on competing with other wolves, which can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.83, which is only 13.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring that both populations can thrive over time."
