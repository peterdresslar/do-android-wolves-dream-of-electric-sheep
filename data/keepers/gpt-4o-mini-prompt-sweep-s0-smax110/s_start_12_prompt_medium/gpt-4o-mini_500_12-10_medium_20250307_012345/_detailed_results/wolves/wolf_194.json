However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.27, it is essential to maintain a balance that allows for sustainable coexistence. By setting theta at 0.30, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the wolf population is also relatively high. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain our numbers while allowing the sheep to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining balance and responding to population trends.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while it is beneficial to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must remain cautious to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A gradual increase allows for a balanced approach, ensuring both populations can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still considering the long-term health of the sheep population. A gradual increase is prudent to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.59, which is only 25.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity and promote a more sustainable balance between our populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.17, which is only 20.2% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to help sustain wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.35 aligns with the wisdom of making small adjustments in response to the current state of both populations.",

This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate increase to 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population and maintaining a balance with the wolf population.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.87, which is only 9.9% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting. This will help balance the populations and avoid depleting the sheep further.",
