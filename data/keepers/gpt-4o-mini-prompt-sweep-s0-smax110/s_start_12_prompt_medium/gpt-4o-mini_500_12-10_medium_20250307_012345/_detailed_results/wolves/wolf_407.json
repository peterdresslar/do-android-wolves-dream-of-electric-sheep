However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.81, it is essential to maintain a balance that allows for sustainable coexistence. A moderate increase in hunting intensity to 0.55 will help support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover and thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the sheep-to-wolf ratio at 1.33, it is important to maintain a sustainable coexistence while ensuring that the wolf population remains healthy. A moderate theta will help prevent overhunting while still allowing for some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 56.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population slightly higher than the sheep population, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term survival of both species. This moderate adjustment helps maintain balance as the wolf population is relatively high, and it allows for gradual adaptation to changing conditions without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 36.50, which is only 33.2% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking over-depletion of the sheep. A moderate increase to 0.45 will help sustain both populations while allowing for gradual adjustments in response to future changes."
