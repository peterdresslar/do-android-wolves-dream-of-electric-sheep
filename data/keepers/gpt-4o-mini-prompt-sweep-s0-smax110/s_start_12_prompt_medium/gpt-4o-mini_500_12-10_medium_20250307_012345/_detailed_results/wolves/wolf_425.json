            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating a need for careful hunting to prevent overpopulation and ensure sustainability. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain the balance while allowing for some recovery of the wolf population as well.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A balanced approach will help sustain both sheep and wolf populations, avoiding depletion while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover and prevent overexploitation. This lower theta will help maintain a balance and avoid potential crashes in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery and prevent depletion. Maintaining a lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, as it allows for a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at its maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in sheep numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition among wolves while giving the sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and a moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep too quickly. This adjustment allows for sustainable coexistence while also supporting the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 82.4% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity while still ensuring the long-term survival of both species. This adjustment allows for sustainable coexistence as I monitor the trends in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, but I want to ensure that we do not overhunt them. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a more cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population. This balance will help sustain both species in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover gradually.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.70, it indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. This adjustment will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population remains healthy for future hunting.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.19, which is only 25.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for the sheep to recover. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity from 0.450 to 0.40, I can focus more on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting. This approach will help maintain a balance between the wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term survival for both.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.01, which is only 20.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.26, which is only 16.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for wolf survival with the necessity of sustaining the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.60, which is only 14.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem."
