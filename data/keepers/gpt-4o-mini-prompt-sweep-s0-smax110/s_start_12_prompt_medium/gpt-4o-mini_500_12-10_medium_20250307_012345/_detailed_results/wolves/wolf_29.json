            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that we should reduce hunting intensity to allow for recovery and sustainability. A moderate theta will help maintain a balance between our needs and the health of the sheep population, ensuring long-term survival for both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A lower theta will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can stabilize, which is crucial for our long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at its maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. A moderate theta value will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can stabilize, preventing future crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity can be increased slightly to ensure wolf reproduction while still allowing for sheep recovery. A gradual increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, avoiding sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and a slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain the balance without depleting the sheep too quickly. This adjustment allows for sustainable coexistence while also supporting the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 87.1% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep. This moderate adjustment helps maintain a sustainable coexistence as the wolf population is also growing, and I want to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, but the wolf population is also significant. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain their numbers. This approach supports sustainable coexistence and avoids depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, given the relatively high wolf population, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 37.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.59, it is important to maintain a balanced approach to ensure both populations can thrive. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to sustain itself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.75, which is only 28.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I need to maintain some hunting to support wolf reproduction, I should not increase hunting intensity too much to allow the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.45 reflects a cautious approach that balances the need for sustenance with the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.28, which is only 23.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for sustenance with the long-term health of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.62, which is only 18.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to allow for some sheep population recovery while still ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without risking a depletion of sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.66, which is only 16.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for more hunting intensity while still being cautious about the wolf population growth, ensuring a balance that supports both species in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.20, which is only 13.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing our own population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly, promoting a sustainable balance."
