            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently healthy and close to its maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate hunting approach. This will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term survival for both. Additionally, with the wolf population at a manageable level, a lower theta will allow sheep to recover while still providing enough resources for wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the balance between wolves and sheep. This adjustment will help sustain both populations without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual increase aligns with the current trends and ensures a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 68, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment reflects a balance between ensuring the wolf population remains healthy while allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual increase is prudent given the current dynamics.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 30.82, which is only 28.0% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure my hunting supports wolf reproduction, I must also allow the sheep population to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance and prevent over-depletion of the sheep, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.26, which is only 22.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach that considers both immediate needs and long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.85, which is only 18.0% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, allowing for sustainable coexistence while still addressing the needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.04, which is only 15.5% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure my pack can thrive, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.02, which is only 13.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some reproduction among wolves while still giving sheep a chance to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.55, which is only 12.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep further, promoting a more balanced ecosystem.",
