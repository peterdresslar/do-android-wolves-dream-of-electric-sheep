            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 186\n- Sheep population: 75.20\n- Wolf population: 59.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.404\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 1.27 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 68.4% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must also be cautious not to deplete the sheep too quickly. A small increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that considers both the current sheep population and the need to maintain a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for some hunting without risking depletion. Given the wolf population is slightly higher than the sheep, a small reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and allow both populations to stabilize. This approach aligns with the wisdom of making gradual adjustments to ensure long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 41.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the wolf population is relatively high. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain their numbers. This approach supports long-term coexistence and avoids depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.59, which is only 25.1% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must prioritize the recovery of the sheep. A lower theta allows for competition with other wolves while giving sheep a chance to rebound, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.17, which is only 20.2% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still being cautious. A theta of 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, enabling me to maintain a sustainable coexistence with the sheep while also considering the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.38, which is only 16.7% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance and support the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.98, which is only 14.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.90, which is only 12.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By slightly lowering my hunting intensity, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize while still ensuring the wolf pack remains healthy. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",

However, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A gradual increase allows for a sustainable balance while still considering the current wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.80, which is only 10.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need to compete with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to support our population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable ecosystem.",

This adjustment reflects a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still allowing sheep to recover.",

This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting without risking the depletion of the sheep population, while also considering the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.87, which is only 9.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help ensure the sheep population stabilizes while also allowing for a gradual adjustment in the wolf population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.98, which is only 10.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting without risking depletion. By increasing theta slightly to 0.40, I can maintain a balance that allows for some hunting while still considering the need for sheep recovery and the overall health of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.09, which is only 10.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. Additionally, with a wolf population of 19, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is already low, suggesting that a more competitive approach among wolves is necessary to maintain balance. A theta of 0.35 allows for a slight focus on competition while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.45, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking over-depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance as the wolf population is also relatively high. By gradually increasing my hunting intensity, I can support the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.82, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking their long-term survival. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep too quickly. A gradual increase aligns with the wisdom of adapting to changing conditions.",

While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, allowing both populations to stabilize without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.76, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment helps maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring both populations can thrive in the long term."
