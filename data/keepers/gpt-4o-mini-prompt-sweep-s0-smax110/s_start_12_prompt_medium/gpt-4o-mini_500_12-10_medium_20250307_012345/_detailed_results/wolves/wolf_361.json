            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A balanced approach will help sustain both populations, as increasing hunting now could lead to a depletion of sheep and future challenges for the wolf pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. A lower theta will help maintain a balance between competing wolves and the sheep population, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 3.79, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery. Maintaining a lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, preventing overexploitation of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and a slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep too quickly. This moderate adjustment allows for sustainable coexistence while also supporting the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high at 102.60, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population also being significant at 42.00, I need to be cautious not to overhunt and risk depleting the sheep too quickly. A gradual increase to 0.40 allows for sustainable coexistence while still supporting wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 90.75, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balanced approach. This adjustment will help support the wolf population without risking the depletion of sheep. It reflects a cautious strategy that considers both current conditions and the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term health of both sheep and wolves. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to maintain balance, as the wolf population is also significant. A moderate theta will help ensure that we do not deplete the sheep too quickly while still allowing for some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sustainable coexistence. A gradual increase from my previous theta will help maintain balance as the sheep population grows.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 41.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 70, it is wise to maintain a cautious approach to hunting. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still ensuring the wolves can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover gradually.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.19, which is only 23.8% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.45 to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for sustainable coexistence while still considering the need for hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.63, which is only 18.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population and maintaining a balance with the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.09, which is only 15.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of the wolf pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.63, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 will help maintain a balance without over-depleting the sheep."
