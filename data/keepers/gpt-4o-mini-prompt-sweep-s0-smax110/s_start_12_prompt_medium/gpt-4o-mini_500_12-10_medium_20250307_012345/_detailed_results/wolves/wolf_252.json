            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 269\n- Sheep population: 10.11\n- Wolf population: 25.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.300\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.40 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 9.2% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 72.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.42, it is wise to maintain a balanced approach to ensure the sustainability of both populations. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a focus on competition among wolves while still permitting some hunting to support reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while it is beneficial to maintain some hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I want to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a more balanced approach, ensuring both populations can thrive without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.70, it is essential to maintain a balance that allows both populations to thrive. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help sustain the sheep while allowing the wolf population to stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.99, which is only 32.7% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I also want to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.74, which is only 25.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack without depleting the sheep further, promoting a healthier ecosystem balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.26, which is only 19.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach to hunting while still considering the need to compete with other wolves. This gradual adjustment helps maintain both populations in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.37, which is only 15.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta value allows for some hunting while still focusing on the competition with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.83, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a need for cautious hunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still being mindful of the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.10, which is only 11.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain our wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need to adapt to the changing conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.78, which is only 10.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some sustainable hunting. This will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem and ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.12, which is only 10.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.54, which is only 9.6% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.4 to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, reducing hunting intensity while still competing with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.24, which is only 9.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help ensure the sheep population stabilizes while allowing our wolf pack to adapt to the current conditions. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.11, which is only 9.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should be cautious with our hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach that supports wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the sustainability of the sheep population."
