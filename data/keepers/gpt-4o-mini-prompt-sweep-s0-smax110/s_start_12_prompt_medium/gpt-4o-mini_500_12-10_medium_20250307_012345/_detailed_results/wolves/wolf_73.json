            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level relative to the maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are not enough sheep to sustain aggressive hunting. A moderate theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while also giving sheep a chance to recover. This balance is essential for long-term survival.",

This suggests that while I can increase my hunting intensity slightly, I should still prioritize a balanced approach to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.40 reflects a moderate increase in hunting while still considering the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.66, which is only 16.1% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A gradual adjustment helps maintain balance and ensures both populations can thrive.",

This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of avoiding sudden changes and promoting long-term sustainability.",
