            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 266\n- Sheep population: 11.12\n- Wolf population: 37.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.350\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.30 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 10.1% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover if needed. A gradual adjustment is key to maintaining balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid over-depletion of the sheep, ensuring a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 72.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, the wolf population is also significant at 56, which suggests that I should maintain a balanced approach to avoid over-depleting the sheep while ensuring the wolf population remains stable. A theta of 0.60 allows for continued hunting without risking a crash in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 32.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. Given the current wolf population is relatively high, a slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow for better competition among wolves while still enabling some hunting to support reproduction. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.74, which is only 25.2% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A moderate increase from my previous theta of 0.40 helps maintain a balance between hunting and competing with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.26, which is only 19.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for the sheep to recover. By setting a lower theta, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow, while also preventing overhunting that could lead to a crash in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.37, which is only 15.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for more hunting without risking a rapid depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.83, which is only 13.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is an opportunity to hunt, I need to be cautious and avoid overexploitation. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring that both populations can recover and thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.10, which is only 11.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is potential for recovery in the sheep population. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity to 0.40, I can help maintain a balance that allows for sustainable coexistence while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep too quickly. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of responding to population trends.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.78, which is only 10.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta will help balance our needs without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.12, which is only 10.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still being mindful of the sheep"
