            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 194\n- Sheep population: 13.90\n- Wolf population: 46.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.400\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.30 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 12.6% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This approach helps maintain a balance in the ecosystem and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep to recover while ensuring our long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is near its maximum capacity, indicating that they can sustain a bit more hunting without risking depletion. However, with the wolf population also present, I need to be cautious and avoid over-hunting. A moderate increase in theta allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is close to its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. It",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 82.2% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the balance between wolf and sheep populations. This moderate adjustment will help maintain sustainability and prevent over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still below its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, and while it is beneficial to increase hunting slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must also consider the growing wolf population. A small decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and allow the sheep to recover without risking over-depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 41.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both populations can thrive. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting intensity while still prioritizing balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but still below half of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term survival of both species. A moderate approach will help maintain balance as the wolf population grows.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.59, which is only 25.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is some opportunity for hunting, it is crucial to prioritize the recovery of the sheep population to ensure long-term sustainability. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow sheep to recover while still enabling wolves to compete effectively.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.17, which is only 20.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.38, which is only 16.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support our wolf population without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.98, which is only 14.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should be cautious with our hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting sustainable coexistence while still enabling some hunting to support our wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.90, which is only 12.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for sustenance with the long-term health of both species."
