            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring sustainable coexistence while also allowing for some growth in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help support wolf reproduction while still ensuring that the sheep population can recover and remain sustainable. A gradual adjustment is key to maintaining balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight reduction in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a sustainable balance as the wolf population grows, ensuring that both species can thrive without depleting resources too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.89, it indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring both populations can thrive while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 41.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.67, it is essential to maintain a balance that allows both populations to thrive. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help the sheep recover while still allowing for some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still being cautious. This adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term survival for both. A gradual increase from my previous theta reflects the need to adapt to the current conditions without risking over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.59, which is only 25.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is potential for recovery in the sheep population if I focus more on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting. By adopting a lower theta, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while allowing the sheep to recover and maintain a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.17, which is only 20.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.38, which is only 16.7% of its maximum capacity. While I want to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.98, which is only 14.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.90, which is only 12.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This moderate approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be increased slightly to support wolf reproduction. However, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly, so a moderate increase allows for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.80, which is only 10.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring a balance that supports both populations."
