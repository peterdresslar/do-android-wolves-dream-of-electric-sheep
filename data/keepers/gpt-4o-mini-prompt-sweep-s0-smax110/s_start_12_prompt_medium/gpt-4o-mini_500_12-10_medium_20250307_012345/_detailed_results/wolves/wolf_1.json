            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 0\n- Sheep population: 12.00\n- Wolf population: 10.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.500\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 1.20 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 10.9% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low relative to the maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we have a decent number of sheep available. However, with the wolf population also being significant, I want to ensure we don",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.61, which allows for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without depleting their numbers too quickly. This adjustment supports the growth of the wolf population while still allowing for sustainable coexistence with the sheep. A gradual increase helps maintain balance and avoids sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem."
