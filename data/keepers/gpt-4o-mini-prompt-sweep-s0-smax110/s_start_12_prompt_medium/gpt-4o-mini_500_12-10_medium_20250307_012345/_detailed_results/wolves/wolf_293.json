            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating a need to reduce hunting intensity to allow for recovery. However, with a healthy sheep population, I can still maintain a moderate hunting approach to ensure the wolf population remains stable. This balance will help prevent over-depletion of sheep while allowing for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to prevent depletion. A theta of 0.60 allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while ensuring that the sheep population can recover and maintain balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A balanced approach will help sustain both populations without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and while it is important to maintain a healthy wolf population, I need to prioritize the sustainability of the sheep. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is close to its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction without risking a significant depletion of the sheep population. It reflects a cautious approach to ensure long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 96.42, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a sustainable balance. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep do not become overhunted. A gradual increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, responding to the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the overall health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while we can increase our hunting intensity slightly, it is important to maintain a balance to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A moderate adjustment allows for coexistence while still supporting our wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 49.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 67, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both populations can thrive. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that supports reproduction while still considering the long-term health of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the wolf population is relatively high. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still providing enough resources for the wolves. This approach supports long-term coexistence and avoids over-depleting the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 29.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, the wolf population is relatively high, so I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still considering the long-term balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.33, which is only 23.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that the sheep need time to recover, and a lower hunting intensity will allow for their population to stabilize. Additionally, with a wolf population of 66.00, focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting will help maintain our numbers while ensuring the sheep can bounce back.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.10, which is only 18.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.87, which is only 15.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting a theta of 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.67, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I also want to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support reproduction while still prioritizing the sustainability of both populations."
