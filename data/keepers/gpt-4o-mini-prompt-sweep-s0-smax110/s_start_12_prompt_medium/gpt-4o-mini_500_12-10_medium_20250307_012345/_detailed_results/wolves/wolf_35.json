            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 59\n- Sheep population: 13.78\n- Wolf population: 44.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.350\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.31 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 12.5% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This approach helps maintain a balance in the ecosystem and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. A slight increase in hunting intensity will allow for some reproduction among wolves while still giving sheep a chance to recover. This approach maintains a balance and avoids depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a sustainable balance. This adjustment will help support the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 95.85, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking over-depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring the sheep can recover in the long term. A gradual increase aligns with the wisdom of adapting to changing conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 75.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.54, it is essential to maintain a balance to ensure the wolf population does not grow too rapidly. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help sustain our population while allowing for some recovery in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population also being significant, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 48.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 68.00, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 37.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69.00, it's important to avoid overhunting to prevent future crashes. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that supports both sheep recovery and wolf population stability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.75, which is only 28.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing our wolf population. A lower theta value will help reduce hunting intensity and promote a more sustainable balance between the two populations, ensuring long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.28, which is only 23.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without risking a crash in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.62, which is only 18.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I need to maintain a focus on hunting to support wolf reproduction, I should do so cautiously to allow the sheep population to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the balance of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.66, which is only 16.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.20, which is only 13.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for sustenance with the long-term health of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.78, which is only 12.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for wolves to thrive."
