            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 336\n- Sheep population: 13.09\n- Wolf population: 45.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.350\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.29 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 11.9% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that a more moderate hunting intensity is necessary to prevent over-depletion of their numbers. This allows for a sustainable balance while still enabling some hunting to support the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is close to its maximum capacity, and while it is important to maintain a healthy wolf population, I need to ensure that the sheep have enough time to recover. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will help balance the ecosystem while still allowing for some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 87.7% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 82.94, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we have enough sheep to sustain our pack without overhunting. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while still ensuring our wolf pack remains strong.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 63.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population also being relatively high, I want to avoid overhunting and allow both populations to thrive. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still recognizing the need to adapt to changing conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 49.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.81, it is important to maintain a balanced approach to ensure the long-term survival of both species. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while still competing with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover gradually.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 29.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 69, a higher theta could lead to overhunting and depletion of sheep. A moderate decrease to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, enabling both populations to stabilize while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.33, which is only 23.0% of maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for more hunting intensity while still being cautious, as the wolf population is relatively high at 66.00. This approach aims to balance the needs of both wolves and sheep, ensuring long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.10, which is only 18.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support our wolf population without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.87, which is only 15.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.67, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A slight decrease from my previous theta of 0.4 will help balance our needs with the sustainability of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderate to allow for recovery while still ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. A gradual increase from my previous theta will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep too quickly."
