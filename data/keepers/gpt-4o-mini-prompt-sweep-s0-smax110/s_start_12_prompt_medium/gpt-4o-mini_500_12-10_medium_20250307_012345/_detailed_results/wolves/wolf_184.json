            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 82.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep. However, my previous theta was very low, and the wolf population is stable at 50. To ensure a gradual recovery of the sheep while still allowing for some hunting, I will increase my hunting intensity slightly to promote a sustainable balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term health of both populations. This moderate approach helps balance the needs of the wolf pack with the recovery of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still being cautious. This adjustment will help maintain the balance between wolf and sheep populations, promoting coexistence and ensuring long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 41.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level relative to the maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A slight decrease from my previous theta will help balance the needs of both populations while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.59, which is only 25.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for more hunting while still considering the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.17, which is only 20.2% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance and support the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the wolf population is relatively high. A moderate approach allows for some hunting while still giving the sheep a chance to recover. This balance helps ensure the long-term survival of both species without risking a crash in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.98, which is only 14.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.90, which is only 12.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover while still competing with other wolves. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for wolf population stability and the recovery of sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be increased slightly to ensure the wolf population remains healthy. However, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep further, so a moderate increase allows for sustainable coexistence while still addressing the immediate needs of the pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.80, which is only 10.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to allow the sheep to recover while also considering the growing wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack without depleting the sheep further, promoting a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.30, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.02, which is only 10% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking immediate depletion of the sheep. A moderate increase to 0.45 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for some hunting while still considering the need for sheep recovery and the overall health of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.87, which is only 9.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover.
