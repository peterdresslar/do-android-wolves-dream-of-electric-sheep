            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for some hunting without risking depletion. However, with the wolf population also being significant, a slight reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and allow both populations to thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 48.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.78, it is important to maintain a balance that allows for sustainable coexistence. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help the sheep recover while still allowing for some hunting to support the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 37.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69.00, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that supports both sheep recovery and wolf population health.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.75, which is only 28.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for wolf sustenance with the long-term health of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.28, which is only 23.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting without risking depletion. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.35 to 0.40, I can enhance hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still allowing sheep to recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance."
