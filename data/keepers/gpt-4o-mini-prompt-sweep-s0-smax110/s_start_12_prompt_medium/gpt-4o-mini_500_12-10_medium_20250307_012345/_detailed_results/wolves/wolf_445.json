            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 82.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.81, it is crucial to maintain a balance to avoid overhunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for sustainable hunting while still considering the growth of the wolf population and the need for coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual increase is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while it is beneficial to maintain some hunting to support wolf reproduction, I need to be cautious given the wolf population is slightly higher than the sheep population. A moderate decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still ensuring the wolves can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I want to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.19, which is only 25.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that I can increase my hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A gradual increase to 0.45 strikes a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.01, which is only 20% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover while also considering the growing wolf population. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from the previous theta of 0.450 to 0.35, I can maintain a balance that supports both species without risking a crash in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.26, which is only 16.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a more balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the immediate needs of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.60, which is only 14.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.400 to 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, promoting a sustainable balance without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.78, which is only 12.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should be cautious with our hunting to allow the sheep to recover. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.29, there is a need to ensure that our wolf population remains healthy. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting sustainability while still considering the need for wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.51, which is only 11.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.400 to 0.35, I can maintain a balance that allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term survival of both species. This gradual adjustment helps avoid sudden population crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.61, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking over-depletion. This adjustment aims to support the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.99, which is only 10.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep further."
