A lower theta will help balance the competition among wolves while ensuring that the sheep can stabilize and potentially increase in number again, promoting long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in sheep numbers, jeopardizing the long-term survival of both species. Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover while we focus on competition among wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at its maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in sheep numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to recover and ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively low. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover and prevents overexploitation, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem. It is crucial to avoid sudden changes and focus on gradual adjustments to support both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that we should be cautious with our hunting to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 4.58, it is crucial to focus on competition among wolves to ensure our long-term survival while avoiding overhunting the sheep.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to rebound, ensuring long-term sustainability for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and while I want to increase hunting to support wolf reproduction, I must do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring both populations can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is close to its maximum capacity, and while it is important to maintain a healthy wolf population, I want to ensure that the sheep can recover and thrive. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing sustainability.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep. This adjustment will help maintain a sustainable coexistence as the sheep population is recovering, but I want to avoid overhunting as the wolf population is also on the rise.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover gradually.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.28, which is only 29.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting approach to ensure our own survival. A slight decrease from my previous theta will help balance our needs with the sustainability of the ecosystem.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.10, which is only 18.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing competition among wolves, which will help balance the ecosystem."
