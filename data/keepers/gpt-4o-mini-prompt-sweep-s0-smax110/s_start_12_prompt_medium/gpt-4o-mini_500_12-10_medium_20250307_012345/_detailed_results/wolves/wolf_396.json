            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is necessary to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly, and I want to balance the needs of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for some increased hunting without risking depletion. This adjustment reflects a balance between maintaining a healthy wolf population and ensuring the sheep can recover. A gradual increase in hunting intensity is warranted as the sheep population is still above 50% of maximum capacity, but I must remain cautious to avoid overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help support wolf reproduction while still ensuring that the sheep population can recover and thrive. A gradual approach is essential to avoid over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 31.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 71.00, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.19, which is only 23.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring both populations can recover and thrive over time.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.63, which is only 18.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I need to be cautious about hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover, I also need to maintain a moderate level of hunting to support the wolf population. A theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.09, which is only 15.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for more hunting intensity while still being cautious, as the wolf population is relatively high at 59. I aim to maintain a balance that supports both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.63, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some reproduction among wolves while still giving sheep a chance to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach, ensuring sustainability without risking a rapid decline in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.50, which is only 11.4% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a focus on competition with other wolves, a moderate theta of 0.35 will help balance our needs without depleting the sheep further. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both populations.",

This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some reproduction among wolves while still giving sheep a chance to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 reflects a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without risking a rapid depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.59, which is only 9.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population. This gradual adjustment will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.14, which is only 9.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while ensuring the sheep population has a chance to grow, promoting long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.92, which is only 9.0% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting to support wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.83, which is only 8.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover, and focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep population to stabilize while preventing overhunting. A lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.85, which is only 9.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to sustain itself. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will help balance the needs of both populations without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.00, which is only 9.1% of its maximum capacity. Given the high wolf population of 19.00, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.35, which is only 9.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for gradual hunting without risking depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.75, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is potential for recovery if I reduce my hunting intensity slightly. By increasing theta from 0.35 to 0.40, I can still maintain a focus on hunting while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow, ensuring a sustainable balance between both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.12, which is only 10.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while being mindful of our own population. A slight increase in hunting intensity from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing competition with other wolves, ensuring a balance that supports both species in the long term."
