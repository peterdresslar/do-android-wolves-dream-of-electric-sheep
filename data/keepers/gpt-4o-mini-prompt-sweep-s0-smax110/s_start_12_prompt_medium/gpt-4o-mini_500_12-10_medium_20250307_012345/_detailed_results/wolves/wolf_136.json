This adjustment supports the wolf population while still considering the need for sheep recovery. A moderate increase helps maintain balance as both populations are close to their respective capacities.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 68, which is relatively high, I need to prioritize competition among wolves to prevent overhunting and allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on maintaining balance.",

However, with the wolf population at 67.00, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that supports both sheep recovery and wolf population stability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.26, which is only 22.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring a balance that supports both populations in the long term.",

This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach to hunting while still being mindful of the wolf population growth. This adjustment aims to maintain a healthy ecosystem and prevent sudden population crashes.",
