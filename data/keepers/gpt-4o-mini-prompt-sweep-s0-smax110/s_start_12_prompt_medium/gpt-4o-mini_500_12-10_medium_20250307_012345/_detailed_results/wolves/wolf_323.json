            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 75.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.51, it is wise to focus more on competition with other wolves to allow the sheep population to recover while ensuring our own numbers remain stable. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 63.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. A moderate increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach to hunting while still considering the growth of both sheep and wolf populations. This gradual adjustment helps maintain a healthy ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment reflects the need to balance the growing wolf population while still ensuring the sheep can recover and thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This will help support wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep population too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.28, which is only 29.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is some opportunity for hunting, it is crucial to avoid overexploitation to allow the sheep to recover. A slight reduction from my previous theta of 0.45 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.33, which is only 23.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a more balanced approach while still considering the need for sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.10, which is only 18.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity slightly to allow the sheep population to recover while still competing with other wolves. This moderate approach will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.87, which is only 15.3% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too rapidly. A gradual increase helps maintain balance and sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.67, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting while prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.09, which is only 11.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.99, which is only 10.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach that balances our need for sustenance with the necessity of ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.39, which is only 10.4% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A gradual increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.80, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while maintaining a stable wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.53, which is only 9.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is a need for cautious hunting to allow the sheep to recover while still ensuring that the wolf population can sustain itself. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I need to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low at 10.41, which is only 9.5% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a bit more hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly, aiming for a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.54, which is only 9.6% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable balance, I will focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting. This moderate adjustment will help maintain the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to increase."
