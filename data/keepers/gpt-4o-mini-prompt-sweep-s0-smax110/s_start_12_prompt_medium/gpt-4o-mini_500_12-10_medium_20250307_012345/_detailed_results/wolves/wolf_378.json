            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 412\n- Sheep population: 10.14\n- Wolf population: 32.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.350\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.32 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 9.2% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. A moderate hunting intensity will allow for some sheep depletion while ensuring that both populations can coexist sustainably. This approach balances the need for wolf reproduction with the necessity of allowing the sheep to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 82.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. A moderate increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, supporting wolf reproduction while still considering the long-term health of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep too quickly. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a more balanced approach, considering the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need for long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still considering the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the wolf population is relatively high. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to thrive. This moderate approach helps maintain balance and avoids overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.34, which is only 31.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for more hunting to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious about the sheep population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.19, which is only 23.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still considering the need for sheep recovery and the overall balance of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.63, which is only 18.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is some opportunity for hunting, it is crucial to maintain a balance to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 allows for a moderate approach that supports both wolf and sheep populations without risking overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I need to increase my hunting intensity to ensure the wolf population can thrive, I must do so gradually to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach that supports both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.63, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without risking the sheep population too severely. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still being mindful of the need to adapt to the changing conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.50, which is only 11.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting a lower theta value, I can focus on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.50, which is only 10.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain our wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.59, which is only 9.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery of the sheep. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for wolf sustenance while ensuring the sheep can rebound. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.14, which is only 9.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still being mindful of the need to avoid overhunting."
