A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still considering the long-term sustainability of the sheep population.",

A slight increase from my previous theta reflects a cautious approach to balance hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring sustainable coexistence.",

By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem without depleting the sheep further.",

A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling us to maintain our population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments to ensure long-term sustainability.",
