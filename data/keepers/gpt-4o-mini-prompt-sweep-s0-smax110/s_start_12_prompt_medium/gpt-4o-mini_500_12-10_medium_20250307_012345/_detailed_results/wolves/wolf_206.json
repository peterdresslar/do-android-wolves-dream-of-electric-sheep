            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 41.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure that both populations can thrive. A moderate increase in theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the wolf population is relatively high. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow sheep to recover while still enabling wolves to thrive. This balance is crucial for long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.59, which is only 25.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that I can afford to increase my hunting intensity slightly to help sustain the wolf population, while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep too quickly. A gradual increase to 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while addressing the immediate needs of the wolf pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we need to be cautious with our hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance while still focusing on the competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.38, which is only 16.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a balance and adapting to the current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.98, which is only 14.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach to hunting while still considering the need for wolf population stability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.90, which is only 12.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should prioritize allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support our wolf population without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.79, which is only 11.6% of its maximum capacity.
