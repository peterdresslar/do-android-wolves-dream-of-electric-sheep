            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 482\n- Sheep population: 13.78\n- Wolf population: 47.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.400\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.29 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 12.5% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3. Adjust your hunting intensity gradually in response to population changes\n4. Find a balance that creates sustainable cycles rather than crashes\n5.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. This moderate approach will help maintain a balance between the wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term survival for both.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery and prevent depletion. Maintaining a lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep while allowing for gradual adjustments in the future.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that they can sustain a bit more hunting pressure without risking depletion. However, with the wolf population also present, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A moderate increase in theta allows for some hunting while still considering the long-term balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still healthy and close to its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, I must remain cautious as the wolf population is also significant, and I want to avoid overhunting that could lead to a crash in sheep numbers. A moderate increase to 0.45 allows for sustainable coexistence while still promoting wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 82.4% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing sustainability. This moderate adjustment helps maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 70.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep to hunt. However, with the wolf population at 58, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while I need to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover gradually.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 36.50, which is only 33.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is some opportunity for hunting, it is essential to maintain a balance to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.40 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery. A gradual increase aligns with the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and avoids sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.01, which is only 20% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.26, which is only 16.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach, ensuring we do not deplete the sheep further while still competing effectively with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be increased slightly to support wolf reproduction while still allowing for some recovery of the sheep population. A gradual increase in theta will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.78, which is only 12.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.4 to 0.35, I can focus on a balanced approach that allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term survival of both species. This gradual adjustment helps maintain stability in the ecosystem."
