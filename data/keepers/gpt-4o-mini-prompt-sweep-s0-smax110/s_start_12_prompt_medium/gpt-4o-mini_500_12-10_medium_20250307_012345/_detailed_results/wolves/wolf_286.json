            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that they can sustain some hunting pressure without immediate risk of depletion. A moderate theta allows for continued hunting while also considering the need to maintain a healthy wolf population as we adapt to the current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. With a high sheep-to-wolf ratio and a growing wolf population, focusing on competition among wolves will help maintain balance in the ecosystem without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in sheep numbers, jeopardizing the long-term survival of both species. Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in sheep numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition among wolves while giving the sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery and prevent depletion. Maintaining a focus on competition with other wolves will help stabilize our population while ensuring the sheep can bounce back in the future.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. With a high sheep-to-wolf ratio and a growing wolf population, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 3.79, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and while I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta will enable me to hunt more effectively without depleting the sheep too quickly, maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is close to its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring both can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still healthy at 96.42, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction. However, I must remain cautious and avoid overhunting, as the sheep population is not at maximum capacity. This moderate adjustment allows for a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep can sustain their numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 75.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.51, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, I must remain cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep. A gradual increase will help maintain balance while still allowing for some growth in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, and while it is beneficial to increase hunting intensity slightly, I want to ensure that we do not deplete the sheep too quickly. A theta of 0.40 allows for a balanced approach that supports both wolf reproduction and sheep recovery, keeping the ecosystem stable.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still ensuring that the sheep population can recover. A moderate increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, responding to the current conditions without risking over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.28, which is only 29.3% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, allowing both populations to stabilize without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.33, which is only 23.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for more hunting while still considering the need for balance and sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.10, which is only 18.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight decrease in theta allows for a balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still enabling some hunting to support our population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.87, which is only 15.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity to 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This approach aligns with my goal of ensuring long-term survival for both species."
