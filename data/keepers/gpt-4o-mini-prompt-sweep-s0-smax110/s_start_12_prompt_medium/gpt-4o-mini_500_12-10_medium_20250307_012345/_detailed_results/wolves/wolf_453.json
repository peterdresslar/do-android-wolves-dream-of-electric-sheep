            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 90.62, allowing for some increased hunting intensity without risking depletion. However, I need to be cautious as the wolf population is also significant at 50.00, so a moderate reduction from my previous theta will help maintain balance and avoid overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain our wolf population while still ensuring that the sheep can recover over time. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain our wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover over time. A moderate adjustment will support a balanced ecosystem without risking a rapid decline in sheep numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must also consider the potential for overhunting. A moderate increase allows for a balance that supports both populations without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A theta of 0.45 strikes a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring that both populations can stabilize and thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.19, which is only 25.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is potential for recovery if I reduce hunting intensity slightly. By lowering theta to 0.40, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance while still being cautious about the sheep population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.26, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking over-depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a balance as the sheep population is at only 16.6% of its maximum capacity. A gradual increase in theta will support wolf reproduction while still allowing for the sheep to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.60, which is only 14.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for some hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.78, which is only 12.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is an opportunity to increase hunting intensity slightly to help sustain wolf reproduction while still allowing for some recovery of the sheep population. A gradual increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, considering both the need for wolves to thrive and the importance of not depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.51, which is only 11.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is some opportunity for hunting, it is crucial to prioritize the recovery of the sheep population to ensure long-term sustainability. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, which is necessary given the current wolf population of 42. This approach helps maintain a balance without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.61, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking over-depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a balance as the sheep population is recovering, while also considering the growing wolf population. A gradual increase is necessary to ensure sustainable cycles.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.99, which is only 10.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 reflects a slight increase in hunting compared to my previous value, acknowledging the need for balance as the sheep population can gradually increase, but without putting too much pressure on them. This approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.59, which is only 9.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.39, which is only 9.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should be cautious in our hunting to allow the sheep to recover. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.40, there is still a need to maintain a healthy wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting."
