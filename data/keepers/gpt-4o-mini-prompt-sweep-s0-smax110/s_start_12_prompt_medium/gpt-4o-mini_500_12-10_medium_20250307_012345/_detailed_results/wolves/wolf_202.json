            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the sheep population at 53.6% of maximum capacity, I can afford to maintain a slightly reduced hunting intensity to ensure the sheep can recover while still supporting the wolf population. This adjustment helps to avoid over-depletion of sheep and promotes a sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 41.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.67, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term survival of both species. This moderate adjustment helps maintain balance as the wolf population grows, ensuring we do not deplete the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.59, which is only 25.1% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, allowing both populations to stabilize without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.17, which is only 20.2% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.40 helps maintain balance and avoids sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.38, which is only 16.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while also focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance as both populations adjust.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.98, which is only 14.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly, considering the current dynamics.",
