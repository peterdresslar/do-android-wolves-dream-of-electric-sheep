            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 82.94, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment reflects a balance between ensuring the wolf population can thrive while also allowing the sheep to recover and maintain their numbers. A moderate increase from my previous theta of 0.419 aligns with the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 63.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 61.00, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure our long-term survival. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, focusing on coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and while I need to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.28, which is only 29.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is some room for hunting, it is crucial to avoid overexploitation. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population and maintaining a balance with the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.33, which is only 23.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still being mindful of the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.10, which is only 18.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while also considering the need for sheep recovery and maintaining a stable wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.87, which is only 15.3% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A moderate increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for sustainable coexistence as I monitor both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.67, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.09, which is only 11.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting to support the wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach that promotes coexistence without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.99, which indicates a need for caution in hunting to allow for recovery. A moderate approach will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep can rebound, supporting long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.39, which is only 10.4% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still being cautious. A theta of 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.80, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for some hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.53, which is only 9.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that considers both the need for wolf reproduction and the recovery of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.39, which is only 9.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring a balance that supports both populations in the long run.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.54, which is only 9.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover rather than intensifying hunting. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of both populations, ensuring that we do not deplete the sheep further and can maintain a healthy wolf population."
