            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 326\n- Sheep population: 96.42\n- Wolf population: 46.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.520\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 2.10 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 87.7% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 96.42, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity. This value reflects a balanced approach, ensuring that while I can hunt effectively, I also allow the sheep population to recover and maintain sustainability. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need to avoid overhunting, a slight decrease from my previous theta will help adapt to the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 82.94, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the balance between wolf and sheep populations. This moderate adjustment will help maintain sustainability and prevent over-depletion of the sheep, while also allowing for some growth in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover gradually.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the balance between wolf and sheep populations. This adjustment will help maintain a sustainable coexistence as the sheep population is recovering, but I must remain cautious to avoid overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.61, it indicates that there is still room for cautious hunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still being mindful of the sheep population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.28, which is only 29.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight decrease in theta allows for a balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still enabling some hunting to support reproduction. This strategy promotes sustainability and prevents potential crashes in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.33, which is only 23% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still being mindful of the wolf population growth.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.10, which is only 18.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, focusing on maintaining the wolf population while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.87, which is only 15.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack without depleting the sheep further, promoting a healthier ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.67, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.09, which is only 11.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, ensuring we do not over-deplete the sheep while also considering the growth of our own population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.99, which is only 10.9% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and avoid depleting their numbers further, I will focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting intensively. This approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.39, which is only 10.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting without risking depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I need to maintain a balance, a slight increase in hunting intensity will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. This adjustment allows for a gradual response to the current state of both populations."
