It is crucial to focus on competition with other wolves at this stage to stabilize our population before considering any increase in hunting.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports both wolf reproduction and sheep recovery. This balance helps maintain a sustainable ecosystem while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 56.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.95, I need to be cautious about overhunting, as it could lead to a decline in sheep numbers and ultimately harm our long-term survival. A slight decrease in hunting intensity allows for a more sustainable balance while still considering the needs of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 43.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure our long-term survival. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the balance between our populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 36.50, which is only 33.2% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, allowing both populations to stabilize without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.19, which is only 25.6% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A moderate adjustment helps maintain balance while considering the current trends in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.01, which is only 20% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from the previous theta of 0.450 to 0.35, I can still maintain a balance that allows for some hunting while prioritizing the long-term survival of both species."
