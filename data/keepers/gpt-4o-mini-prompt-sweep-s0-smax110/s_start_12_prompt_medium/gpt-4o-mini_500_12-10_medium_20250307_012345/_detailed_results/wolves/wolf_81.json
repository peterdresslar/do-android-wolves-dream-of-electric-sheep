With a high sheep-to-wolf ratio, focusing on competition with other wolves will help maintain our population while giving sheep a chance to rebound.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in sheep numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover and ensures the long-term survival of both species. It also helps to stabilize the wolf population as we adapt to the current conditions.",

A slight increase from my previous theta will enable me to hunt more effectively while still prioritizing the long-term balance of the ecosystem.",

This moderate adjustment allows for sustainable coexistence while also considering the current wolf population growth.",

This adjustment will help support the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly, aligning with the wisdom of gradual changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 84.2% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover if needed. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",

By adjusting theta downwards, I can focus on competition with other wolves while allowing the sheep to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.57, it indicates that we should be cautious about overhunting. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 30.82, which is only 28.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly, considering the current dynamics.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.26, which is only 22.1% of its maximum capacity.
