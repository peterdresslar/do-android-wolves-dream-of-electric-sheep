            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 415\n- Sheep population: 9.85\n- Wolf population: 22.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.300\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.45 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 9.0% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain our wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly, and this theta reflects a balanced approach to coexistence.",

This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual approach is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the sheep-to-wolf ratio being close to 1, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 41.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 70, I need to be cautious about overhunting. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain a healthy population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.19, which is only 23.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.63, which is only 18.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a more balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to overhunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.09, which is only 15.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring that both populations can stabilize and thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.63, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for sustainable cycles.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.50, which is only 11.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support our needs without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.50, which is only 10.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of the wolf pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.59, which is only 9.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, ensuring we do not deplete the sheep further while still competing with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.14, which is only 9.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is a need for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still allowing for some recovery of the sheep population. A gradual increase to 0.40 strikes a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring that both populations can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.92, which is only 9.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while maintaining a stable wolf population. A moderate theta value will help balance our hunting needs with the sustainability of the sheep, ensuring both populations can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.83, which is only 8.9% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain a balance and prevent overhunting, ensuring sustainable cycles.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.85, which is only 9.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is a need for cautious hunting to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting for the wolves. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without risking a rapid decline in the sheep population."
