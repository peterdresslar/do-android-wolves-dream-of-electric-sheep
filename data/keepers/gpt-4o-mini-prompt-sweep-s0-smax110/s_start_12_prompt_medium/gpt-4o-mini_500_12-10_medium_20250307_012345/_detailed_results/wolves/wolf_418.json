Maintaining a lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, as it allows the sheep population to stabilize while we focus on competition among wolves.",

Maintaining a balance is crucial for the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, and with the current sheep-to-wolf ratio being high, it",

Maintaining a lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, avoiding overexploitation of the sheep population while we focus on competition among wolves.",

However, with the wolf population also present, a gradual increase allows for sustainable coexistence while avoiding sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",

This adjustment allows for sustainable coexistence while also supporting the wolf population",

A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to sustain itself.",

A moderate increase to 0.45 reflects a balance between ensuring the wolf population remains healthy and allowing the sheep to recover without depleting their numbers too quickly.",
