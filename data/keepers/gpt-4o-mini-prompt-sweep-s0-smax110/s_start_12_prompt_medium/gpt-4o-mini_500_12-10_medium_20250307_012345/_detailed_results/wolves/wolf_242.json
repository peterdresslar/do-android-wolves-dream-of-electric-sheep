            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 267\n- Sheep population: 10.54\n- Wolf population: 33.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.400\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.32 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 9.6% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 94.4% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while still ensuring that the sheep can recover over time. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 93.34, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep do not become too depleted. A gradual increase is necessary to maintain balance and avoid sudden crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, and my previous theta of 0.55 was slightly aggressive given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio. A slight reduction to 0.50 allows for a balanced approach, ensuring that both populations can thrive while still enabling some hunting to support wolf reproduction. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of making gradual changes to maintain sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69.00, it is wise to maintain a moderate hunting intensity to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly while still allowing for some reproduction among wolves. A gradual adjustment helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 32.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.51, I need to be cautious about overhunting to ensure the long-term survival of both species. A slight decrease in hunting intensity allows for the sheep population to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.74, which is only 25.2% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A moderate increase from my previous theta of 0.400 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.26, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a need for cautious hunting. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach helps maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.37, which is only 15.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A moderate increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while giving sheep a chance to rebound. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.10, which is only 11.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By increasing my theta slightly to 0.40, I can maintain a focus on competition with other wolves while allowing for a gradual increase in hunting intensity as the sheep population stabilizes. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.78, which is only 10.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on the competition with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.12, which is only 10.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some reproduction among wolves while still giving sheep a chance to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach, promoting sustainability without risking a crash in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.54, which is only 9.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes."
