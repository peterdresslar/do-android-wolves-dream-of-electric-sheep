            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual adjustment is necessary to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring a balance that supports both species in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the sheep-to-wolf ratio being close to 1, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 41.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. A moderate theta of 0.50 allows for a balanced approach, enabling me to hunt effectively while also considering the need for sheep recovery and the growing wolf population. This adjustment supports long-term coexistence without risking a depletion of resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 31.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 71, I need to be cautious and avoid over-hunting. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, promoting sustainable coexistence while still enabling some hunting to support wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.19, which is only 23.8% of its maximum capacity. While I want to ensure the wolves can thrive, I also recognize the need to allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, allowing both populations to stabilize and grow sustainably.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.63, which is only 18.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is an opportunity to hunt, a more moderate approach will allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable balance. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from the previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35, I can maintain a focus on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, promoting coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.09, which is only 15.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.63, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.50, which is only 11.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and allowing the sheep population to stabilize, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and while I need to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.59, which is only 9.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for wolf population sustainability while giving sheep a chance to rebound.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.14, which is only 9.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for gradual hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.92, which is only 9.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our needs without depleting the sheep further, promoting a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.83, which is only 8.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a bit more hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep.",

This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover.
