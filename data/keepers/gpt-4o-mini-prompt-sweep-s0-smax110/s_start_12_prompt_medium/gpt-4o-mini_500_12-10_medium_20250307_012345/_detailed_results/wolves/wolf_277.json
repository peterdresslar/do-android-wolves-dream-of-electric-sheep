            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at maximum capacity, and while I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta value will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, preventing over-depletion of the sheep while still allowing for some hunting.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively low. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover and ensures that we do not deplete their numbers too quickly. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderate to allow for recovery while still ensuring the wolf population can sustain itself. A slight increase from my previous theta reflects a cautious approach to take advantage of the abundant sheep without risking depletion.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition with other wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at its maximum capacity, and maintaining a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover and prevent overexploitation. This approach also helps to stabilize the wolf population as we focus on competition with other wolves rather than aggressive hunting.",

A moderate approach allows for some hunting while also enabling the sheep to recover and maintain balance in the ecosystem. This adjustment also considers the growing wolf population, ensuring we do not overhunt.",

A slight increase from my previous theta allows for more hunting to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. This moderate adjustment reflects the current balance and aims for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 96.42, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while maintaining a sustainable balance. This adjustment reflects the need to support the wolf population without over-depleting the sheep. A gradual increase helps ensure long-term survival for both species.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.28, which is only 29.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a more balanced approach, giving sheep a chance to recover while still enabling wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.33, which is only 23.0% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking immediate depletion.
