            "I chose this theta because it allows for a moderate increase in hunting intensity, reflecting the current sheep population's ability to sustain some pressure while also considering the growing wolf population. This approach promotes coexistence and prevents over-depletion of sheep, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment reflects a balance between ensuring the wolf population remains healthy while allowing sheep to recover and thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 48.0% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.78, a moderate increase to 0.45 will help sustain both populations while still allowing for some competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 37.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.59, a moderate hunting intensity will allow for sustainable coexistence while still enabling the wolf population to thrive. This small adjustment from my previous theta of 0.45 reflects a cautious approach to ensure that both populations can recover and maintain balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.75, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.4 will help maintain a balance while still being cautious about the wolf population growth. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.28, which is only 23.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that I can afford to increase my hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A small adjustment to 0.40 maintains a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.62, which is only 18.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A moderate increase to 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, ensuring that we do not deplete the sheep too quickly while still addressing the needs of our growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.66, which is only 16.1% of its maximum capacity. While I need to maintain a healthy wolf population, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help balance the ecosystem and support the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.20, which is only 13.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for sheep recovery while still competing with other wolves. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.78, which is only 12.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need to adapt to the changing conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.62, which is only 11.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing our wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.4 to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, reducing hunting intensity while still competing with other wolves. This way, we can ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.92, which is only 10.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without over-depleting the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.53, which is only 10.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own population. A lower theta will help reduce competition among wolves and give the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.31, which is only 10.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.10, which is only 10.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and allowing the sheep population to stabilize, ensuring long-term survival for both species."
