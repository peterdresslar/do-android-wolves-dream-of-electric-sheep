            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 405\n- Sheep population: 26.19\n- Wolf population: 69.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.400\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.38 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 23.8% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover and maintain a sustainable balance. This gradual adjustment will help prevent overexploitation of the sheep while also considering the growth of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery. Maintaining a lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, as it prevents overhunting while still allowing for competition among wolves.",

Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover while keeping the wolf population stable.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid depletion of their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover and ensures the long-term survival of both species. It is crucial to focus on competition with other wolves at this stage to stabilize our population before considering any increase in hunting.",

This balance is crucial for the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, especially as the wolf population is already present. Gradual adjustments are key to sustaining our ecosystem.",

Maintaining a lower theta allows for a focus on competition with other wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be cautiously increased to avoid depleting their numbers too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the balance needed for both populations to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a balance as the wolf population grows, ensuring both species can thrive together.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 93.3% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 42, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, but not at maximum capacity. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover further while still enabling the wolf population to thrive. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a balance and responding to the current trends in both populations.",

This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to ensure that the sheep can recover while also supporting the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 41.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 70, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 31.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. Additionally, the wolf population is relatively high, so a slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow for better competition among wolves while still enabling some hunting to support reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.19, which is only 23.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By lowering my hunting intensity slightly, I can focus more on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This approach aligns with my objective of ensuring the long-term survival of both species."
