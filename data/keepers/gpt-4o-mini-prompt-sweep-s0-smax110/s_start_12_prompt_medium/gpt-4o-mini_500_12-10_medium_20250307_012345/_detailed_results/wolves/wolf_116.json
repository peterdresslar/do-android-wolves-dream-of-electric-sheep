            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 92.62, allowing for some increased hunting intensity without risking depletion. However, I want to avoid overhunting, so I am making a moderate adjustment to ensure the sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 78.30, allowing for some hunting to support wolf reproduction. However, since the wolf population is also significant at 56.00, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A moderate decrease from my previous theta will help maintain balance and ensure the sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. It",
            "I chose this theta because it represents a balanced approach to hunting that allows for sustainable coexistence. The sheep population is currently at 44.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for gradual increases in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 68, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the wolf population is relatively high. A moderate hunting intensity will allow for some sheep population growth while preventing overexploitation, ensuring a balance that supports both species in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 30.82, which is only 28.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight reduction from my previous theta allows for a more balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still enabling some hunting to support reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.26, which is only 22.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for moderate hunting without risking depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 allows for a balanced approach to hunting while still considering the need to maintain wolf numbers and avoid overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.85, which is only 18.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.04, which is only 15.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for sustainable cycles.",

This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.400 to 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring a balance that promotes the long-term survival of both species.",

This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, enabling me to adapt to the current conditions while still being mindful of the long-term survival of both species.",

This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.45 to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for some hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.43, which is only 10.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is an opportunity to hunt, it is crucial to avoid overexploitation to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
