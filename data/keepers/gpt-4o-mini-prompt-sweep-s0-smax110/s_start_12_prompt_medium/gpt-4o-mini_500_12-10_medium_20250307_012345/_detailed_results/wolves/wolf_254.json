            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a sustainable balance. This adjustment reflects the need to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly. A moderate approach will help ensure both populations can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 57.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population being slightly higher than the sheep population, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.70, a slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of making gradual changes to ensure sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.99, which is only 32.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to allow for recovery. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.74, which is only 25.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for more hunting to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious to avoid overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.26, which is only 19.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.37, which is only 15.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I need to maintain some hunting to support wolf reproduction, I should focus more on competition with other wolves to allow the sheep population to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 will help balance the needs of both species without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.83, which is only 13.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to ensure the sheep population can recover while still allowing for some wolf reproduction. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach that supports both populations without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.10, which is only 11.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.78, which is only 10.7% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting sheep. This will help maintain the balance and prevent a crash in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.12, which is only 10.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for the sheep to recover, and a slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance without depleting their numbers too quickly. By gradually increasing theta, I can ensure that both the wolf and sheep populations can stabilize and thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.54, which is only 9.6% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help maintain a sustainable balance and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.24, which is only 9.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still giving sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.11, which is only 9.2% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and avoid depleting their numbers further, I will focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensifying hunting. This will help ensure a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.12, which is only 9.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a slight hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A small increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep further."
