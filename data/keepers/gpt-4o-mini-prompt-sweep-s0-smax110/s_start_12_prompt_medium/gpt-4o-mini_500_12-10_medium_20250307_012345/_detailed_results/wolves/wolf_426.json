            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A lower theta will help reduce competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to rebound, ensuring long-term sustainability for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. A moderate approach will help maintain the balance between wolf and sheep populations while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 4.23, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 3.79, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at maximum capacity, and maintaining a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover and prevent overexploitation. This approach also helps to stabilize the wolf population as we compete with each other. Gradual adjustments are key to ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 102.21, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking over-depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports our wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 70.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.33, it is essential to maintain a balance to prevent overhunting. A moderate increase in theta allows for sustainable hunting while also considering the growth of the wolf population, ensuring that both species can thrive together.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 56.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with the wolf population being slightly higher than the sheep population, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 43.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.70, it is essential to maintain a balance that allows for the recovery of the sheep while also ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help sustain both populations without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment reflects a balance between ensuring the wolf population remains healthy while allowing the sheep to recover gradually.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.19, which is only 25.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while still allowing for some hunting to maintain the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.01, which is only 20% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover while also considering the growing wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.26, which is only 16.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.60, which is only 14.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting while prioritizing the long-term balance between both populations."
