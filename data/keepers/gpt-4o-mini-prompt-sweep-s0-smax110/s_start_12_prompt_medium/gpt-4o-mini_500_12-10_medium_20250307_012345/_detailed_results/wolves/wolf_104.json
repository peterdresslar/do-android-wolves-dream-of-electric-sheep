            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 128\n- Sheep population: 12.56\n- Wolf population: 38.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.400\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.33 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 11.4% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3. Adjust your hunting intensity gradually in response to population changes\n4. Find a balance that creates sustainable cycles rather than crashes\n5.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. A lower theta allows for competition among wolves while giving the sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species. This gradual adjustment helps prevent overhunting and maintains a balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently healthy, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep. This moderate adjustment will help sustain both populations without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 84.2% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 47, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring the sheep can recover and thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while we can afford to hunt, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 68, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a focus on competition among wolves, ensuring a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery. A gradual increase is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 30.82, which is only 28.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for more hunting without risking the long-term balance of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.26, which is only 22.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done gradually to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring the wolf population remains healthy while still allowing the sheep to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.85, which is only 18.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from the previous 0.400 to 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring that both populations can stabilize and thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.04, which is only 15.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.02, which is only 13.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I need to maintain a healthy wolf population, I also want to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help sustain my pack while still being mindful of the sheep's ability to bounce back.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.56, which is only 11.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.400 to 0.350, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring a sustainable balance."
