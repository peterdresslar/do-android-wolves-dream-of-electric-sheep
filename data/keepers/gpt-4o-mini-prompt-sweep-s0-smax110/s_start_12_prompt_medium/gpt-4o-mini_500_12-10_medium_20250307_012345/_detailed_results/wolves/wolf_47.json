            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 95.85, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because it represents a balanced approach to hunting. The sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.54, it is wise to maintain a moderate hunting intensity. This will allow for the continued coexistence of both populations while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring both populations can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 48.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 68.00, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to prevent a crash in the sheep population. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, focusing on maintaining both populations while adapting to the current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because it represents a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balanced approach. The sheep population is currently at 37.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. This adjustment allows for gradual population growth among wolves while ensuring that sheep can recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.75, which is only 28.9% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and promote sustainability in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.28, which is only 23.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I need to maintain some hunting to support the wolf population, I should be cautious not to overhunt and risk depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the sustainability of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.62, which is only 18.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to allow the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own wolf population, which is relatively high. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our needs without depleting the sheep further, promoting a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.66, which is only 16.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some reproduction among wolves while still giving sheep a chance to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach that considers both the immediate need for sustenance and the long-term health of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.20, which is only 13.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack without depleting the sheep further, promoting a more balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.78, which is only 12.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without risking a significant depletion of the sheep population. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still being mindful of the need to compete with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the wolf population is relatively high. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling wolves to compete effectively. This moderate approach helps maintain balance and supports long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.92, which is only 10.8% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase in hunting intensity to 0.40 allows for some reproduction among wolves while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep further.",
