            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and a moderate increase in hunting intensity will allow for sustainable coexistence while still enabling the wolf population to thrive. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance without risking a sudden depletion of sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently healthy at 102.21, which is close to maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a sustainable balance. By adjusting theta to 0.40, I can ensure that the wolf population remains healthy without depleting the sheep too quickly, allowing for gradual adaptation to changing conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction without significantly depleting the sheep population, ensuring long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 77.25, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there is enough prey available. However, with the wolf population at 58.00, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still considering the need to maintain a balance with the sheep population. A gradual increase is prudent to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 43.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.70, I need to be cautious about overhunting. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain its health.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 36.50, which is only 33.2% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to over-deplete the sheep. A moderate adjustment helps maintain balance and allows for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 25.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 68, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to prevent a crash in the sheep population. A slight decrease in hunting intensity allows for a balanced approach, ensuring both populations can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.01, which is only 20% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure my pack's survival, it's important to allow the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance, allowing for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves as their numbers are relatively high.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low at 18.26, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking immediate depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a balance as the sheep population is currently at only 16.6% of its maximum capacity. A gradual increase in hunting will support wolf reproduction while still allowing for the sheep to recover over time.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.60, which is only 14.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population and maintaining a balance with the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.78, which is only 12.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting without risking depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.51, which is only 11.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting without depleting the sheep further, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.61, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to help sustain wolf reproduction while still being mindful of the sheep"
