            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a sustainable balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly, considering the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need for gradual changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly and to promote a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 48.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 68, it is wise to avoid overhunting to prevent a decline in sheep numbers and ensure long-term coexistence. A moderate increase in hunting intensity allows for a balance that supports both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 37.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 69.00, it is wise to maintain a moderate hunting intensity to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly while also allowing for some competition among wolves. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low relative to the maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain its health. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of gradual changes to ensure sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.28, which is only 23.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I need to maintain some hunting to support wolf reproduction, I should do so cautiously to allow the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 will help balance the immediate needs of my pack with the long-term sustainability of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.62, which is only 18.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack without depleting the sheep further, promoting a more balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.66, which is only 16.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need to adapt to the changing conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.20, which is only 13.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.92, which is only 10.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while allowing the sheep to increase. This approach aligns with the wisdom of making gradual adjustments and maintaining a sustainable balance.",
