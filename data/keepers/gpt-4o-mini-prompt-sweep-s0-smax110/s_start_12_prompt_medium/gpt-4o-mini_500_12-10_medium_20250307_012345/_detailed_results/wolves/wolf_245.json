            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 267\n- Sheep population: 10.54\n- Wolf population: 33.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.350\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.32 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 9.6% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 93.34, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. However, I must be cautious not to overhunt, as the wolf population is also significant at 47.00. A theta of 0.85 strikes a balance between ensuring wolf reproduction and allowing the sheep population to recover, promoting long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for some increased hunting intensity without risking depletion. However, since the wolf population is also significant, I want to ensure we don",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 57.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population being slightly higher than the sheep population, a moderate approach will allow for coexistence while still enabling some hunting to support wolf reproduction. This gradual adjustment helps prevent over-depletion of sheep and maintains balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating there is still room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 69, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both populations can thrive. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while also considering the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and while it is important to maintain a healthy wolf population, I need to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate hunting intensity will help balance the needs of both species while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.74, which is only 25.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.40 allows for some hunting while still considering the need for sheep recovery and maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.26, which is only 19.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a more balanced approach to hunting while still being mindful of the wolf population, which is currently at 65. I aim to maintain a dynamic balance that supports both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.37, which is only 15.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our needs without depleting the sheep further, promoting a healthier balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively low at 14.83, which is only 13.5% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still being mindful of the need for sustainable coexistence. A gradual increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for some reproduction among wolves while still giving sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.10, which is only 11.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack without depleting the sheep further, promoting a healthier balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.78, which is only 10.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while ensuring the sheep population has a chance to grow, promoting long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.54, which is only 9.6% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and maintain a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting sheep. This will help ensure the long-term survival of both species."
