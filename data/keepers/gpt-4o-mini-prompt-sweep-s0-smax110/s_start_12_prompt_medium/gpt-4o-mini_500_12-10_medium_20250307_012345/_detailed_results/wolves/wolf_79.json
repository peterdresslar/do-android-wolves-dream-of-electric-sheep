However, with the wolf population also being relatively high, a moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep too quickly. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of adapting to changing conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level relative to its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain their numbers. This approach supports long-term sustainability and avoids overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover gradually.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 30.82, which is only 28.0% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.26, which is only 22.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population without depleting the sheep further."
