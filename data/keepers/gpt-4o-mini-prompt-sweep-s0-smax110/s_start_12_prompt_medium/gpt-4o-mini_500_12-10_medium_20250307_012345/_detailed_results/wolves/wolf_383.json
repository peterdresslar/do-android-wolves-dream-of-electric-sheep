            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help support wolf reproduction while still maintaining a sustainable balance with the sheep population. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio, a slight reduction in hunting intensity is warranted to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. This value helps maintain the sheep population while ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. It reflects a gradual adjustment to the current conditions, promoting sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 41.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 70, it\u2019s important to avoid overhunting to maintain our numbers. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring both sheep and wolves can thrive together.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level relative to the maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. This adjustment will help ensure the long-term survival of both species while maintaining a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.19, which is only 23.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is some opportunity for hunting, it is crucial to avoid overexploitation to allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance between the wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term survival for both.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.63, which is only 18.8% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A gradual increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.09, which is only 15.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it is crucial to maintain a balance to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 allows for a more moderate approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still enabling some hunting to support our population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.63, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.50, which is only 11.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 reflects a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between our populations. It allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction but avoids overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.50, which is only 10.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need to adapt to the changing conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.59, which is only 9.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of both populations. This approach helps maintain a balance as the wolf population is relatively high at 37.00, and we need to avoid over-depleting the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.14, which is only 9.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By increasing my theta slightly from 0.35 to 0.40, I can maintain some hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term survival of both species. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of avoiding sudden changes and responding to the current state of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.92, which is only 9.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly, promoting a sustainable balance."
