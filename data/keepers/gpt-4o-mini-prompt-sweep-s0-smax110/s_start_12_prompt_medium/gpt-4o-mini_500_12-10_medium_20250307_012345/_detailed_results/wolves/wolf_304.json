            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 336\n- Sheep population: 13.09\n- Wolf population: 45.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.400\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.29 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 11.9% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and while I need to maintain a strong hunting intensity to support the wolf population, I must also be cautious to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight reduction from my previous theta allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 95.7% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 87.7% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain our wolf population while still ensuring that the sheep can recover. A gradual adjustment is key to maintaining balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.14, it is wise to maintain a moderate hunting intensity to ensure both populations can thrive without depleting the sheep too quickly. This adjustment allows for gradual adaptation to the current conditions while keeping an eye on future trends.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, but the wolf population is also significant. A moderate approach allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some hunting to support our pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 38.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.61, it is essential to maintain a balance that allows for both sheep recovery and wolf sustainability. A moderate theta of 0.40 will help ensure that we do not overhunt while still allowing for some hunting to support our population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.28, which is only 29.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some recovery while still ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.33, which is only 23.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I can increase my hunting intensity slightly, I need to be cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate increase to 0.40 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population and maintaining a balance with my fellow wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.10, which is only 18.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still being mindful of the need to compete with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.87, which is only 15.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a lower hunting intensity is necessary to allow the sheep to recover. Additionally, with a wolf population of 56, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low at 0.30, indicating that competition among wolves is significant. A theta of 0.35 allows for a slight focus on hunting while still prioritizing the sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.67, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of the wolf pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.09, which is only 11.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a balance and responding to the current state of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.99, which is only 10.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to ensure the sheep population can recover while still allowing for some reproduction among wolves. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly."
