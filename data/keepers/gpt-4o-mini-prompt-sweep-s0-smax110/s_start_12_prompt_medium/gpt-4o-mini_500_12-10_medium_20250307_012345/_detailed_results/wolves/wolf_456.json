            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 70.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.33, I need to be cautious about overhunting to ensure the long-term survival of both species. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, enabling sustainable coexistence while still allowing for some hunting to support the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 56.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With the wolf population slightly higher than the sheep population, a moderate hunting intensity will allow for sustainable coexistence while preventing over-depletion of the sheep. This gradual adjustment will help maintain the balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual increase is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 36.50, which is only 33.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is some room for hunting, I need to be cautious and avoid over-depleting the sheep. A moderate theta of 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, enabling sustainable coexistence while still permitting some hunting to support the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.19, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment is moderate enough to maintain a balance while still considering the growth of the wolf population. It reflects a cautious approach to ensure both species can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.01, which is only 20% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.26, which is only 16.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.4 to 0.35, I can maintain a balance that focuses on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be increased slightly to ensure the wolf population remains healthy. However, I must be cautious and avoid drastic changes, as the sheep need time to recover. A gradual increase allows for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the wolf population is relatively high. A moderate hunting intensity allows for some hunting while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This approach helps maintain a balance between both populations, ensuring long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.51, which is only 11.4% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help me maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.61, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our needs without depleting the sheep further, promoting a more balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.99, which is only 10.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of the wolf pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.59, which is only 9.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own population. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance and prevent over-depletion of the sheep, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.39, which is only 9.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is potential for recovery if we reduce hunting intensity slightly. By increasing theta from 0.35 to 0.40, I aim to strike a balance that allows for some hunting while still giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.29, which is only 9.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population.
