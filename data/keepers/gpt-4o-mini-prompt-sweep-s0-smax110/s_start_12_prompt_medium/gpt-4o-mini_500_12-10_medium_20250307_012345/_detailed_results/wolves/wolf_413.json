            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 479\n- Sheep population: 22.01\n- Wolf population: 64.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.450\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.34 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 20.0% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting sheep aggressively. This will allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a healthy balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 13.75, it is crucial to avoid overhunting to ensure the long-term survival of both species. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach while still being cautious.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover and ensures a sustainable balance between our populations. It also helps to avoid competition among wolves as we adapt to the current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively low. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover and prevents overexploitation, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and prioritizes long-term survival.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution in hunting to avoid depleting their numbers too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the long-term balance of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover.

Maintaining a focus on competition with other wolves will help stabilize our population while ensuring the sheep can rebound.",

A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still healthy at 92.9% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover if needed. A gradual increase is prudent to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 82.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with the wolf population at 50, it",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 56.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population slightly higher than the sheep population, it is wise to maintain a cautious approach to avoid over-depleting the sheep. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow for a balanced coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 36.50, which is only 33.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate increase to 0.40 allows for some hunting while still focusing on the competition with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.19, which is only 25.6% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A gradual increase in theta will help maintain balance as the sheep population recovers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.01, which is only 20% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population. By setting theta to 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring a balance that promotes long-term sustainability."
