            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in sheep numbers, jeopardizing long-term sustainability. Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should remain low to allow for recovery and prevent depletion. Maintaining a balance is crucial for the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, especially as the wolf population is relatively stable. Gradual adjustments will help ensure sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in their numbers. Maintaining a lower theta allows for competition with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring both can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 93.3% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 42, I need to be cautious to avoid over-depleting the sheep. A gradual increase to 0.45 allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, but I need to be cautious as the wolf population is also significant. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to thrive. This approach maintains a balance and avoids depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still promoting coexistence. This adjustment will help maintain the balance as the sheep population is recovering, but I must remain cautious to avoid over-depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 54.6% of its maximum capacity, which indicates that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population being slightly higher than the sheep population, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight decrease in hunting intensity allows for a balanced approach, ensuring both populations can thrive without leading to a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover and thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level relative to its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A slight decrease in hunting will help maintain a balance, ensuring both sheep and wolves can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.19, which is only 23.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for increased hunting intensity without depleting the sheep too quickly. However, with a wolf population of 69, I need to be cautious to avoid overhunting and ensure sustainable coexistence. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that supports both my pack"
