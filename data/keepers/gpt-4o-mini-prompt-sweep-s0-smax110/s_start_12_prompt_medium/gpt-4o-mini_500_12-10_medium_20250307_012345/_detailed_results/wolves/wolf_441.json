            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 484\n- Sheep population: 11.61\n- Wolf population: 37.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.350\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.31 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 10.6% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 82.4% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep do not become over-depleted. A gradual adjustment is key to maintaining balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A slight reduction from my previous theta reflects the need to balance competition among wolves as their numbers grow.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity while still ensuring the sheep can recover. This approach balances the need for wolf reproduction with the health of the sheep population, avoiding drastic changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity. This will help maintain a balance between the wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term survival for both. Given that the wolf population is also relatively high, a slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow sheep to recover while still supporting wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 36.50, which is only 33.2% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I also want to allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, allowing both populations to stabilize without risking over-depletion of sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.19, which is only 25.6% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. A moderate increase from my previous theta of 0.400 will help maintain a balance as the sheep population recovers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.01, which is only 20% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack but prioritizes the long-term health of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.26, which is only 16.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain our wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help balance hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting a healthier ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.60, which is only 14.2% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.78, which is only 12.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a more balanced approach while still considering the need to compete with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.51, which is only 11.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.61, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly."
