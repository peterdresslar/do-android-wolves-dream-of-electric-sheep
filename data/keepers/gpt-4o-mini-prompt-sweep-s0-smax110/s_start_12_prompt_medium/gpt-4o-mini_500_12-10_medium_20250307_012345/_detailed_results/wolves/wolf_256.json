            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 72.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.42, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover. A theta of 0.25 allows for a gradual approach to hunting, ensuring sustainability and the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and I want to gradually increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. This moderate adjustment allows for a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep can recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support the wolf population without over-depleting the sheep, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.99, which is only 32.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.74, which is only 25.2% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. By raising theta from 0.35 to 0.40, I can support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.26, which is only 19.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that the sheep need time to recover. By setting a lower theta, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This gradual adjustment will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.37, which is only 15.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the immediate needs of the wolf population.",

This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate increase to 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population, ensuring a sustainable balance.",

This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting a lower theta, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize while still maintaining a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.12, which is only 10.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still being mindful of the need to avoid overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.54, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low at 0.32. This indicates that while we need to hunt to sustain our population, we must also allow the sheep to recover.
