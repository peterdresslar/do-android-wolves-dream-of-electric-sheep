            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 45\n- Sheep population: 110.00\n- Wolf population: 26.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.522\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 4.23 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 100.0% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution in hunting to prevent depletion. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. A moderate theta value will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can stabilize, supporting long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and a slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep too quickly. This adjustment allows for sustainable coexistence while also supporting the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking over-depletion. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while maintaining a sustainable balance with the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 87.1% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover if needed. A gradual increase to 0.55 reflects a balanced approach, considering both the current state and the trends in the populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the sheep population at 75.8% of its maximum capacity and a healthy sheep-to-wolf ratio, maintaining a moderate theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both species while allowing for gradual adjustments as conditions change.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some growth in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 48.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a wolf population of 68, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is relatively low at 0.78, suggesting that we need to be cautious with our hunting to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 37.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69.00, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting, which could lead to a depletion of sheep and ultimately harm both populations. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that supports both reproduction and the recovery of sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.75, which is only 28.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a lower hunting intensity is necessary to allow the sheep to recover. Additionally, with a wolf population of 69, maintaining a focus on competition among wolves is prudent to ensure our numbers do not decline too rapidly. A gradual adjustment will help sustain both populations in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.28, which is only 23.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for sustainable cycles.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.62, which is only 18.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for sustenance with the importance of not depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.66, which is only 16.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.20, which is only 13.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population. This gradual adjustment helps ensure the long-term survival of both species."
