            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high relative to the sheep population, and the sheep are at nearly half of their maximum capacity. A lower theta allows for competition among wolves, which can help stabilize our numbers while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment is essential for maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 37.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. Given the current wolf population, a moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance while allowing for some recovery of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.75, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderate to allow for recovery. Increasing theta slightly from 0.35 to 0.40 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring both populations can thrive over time.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.28, which is only 23.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that supports wolf reproduction while still considering the long-term sustainability of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.62, which is only 18.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support our needs without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.66, which is only 16.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A small increase to 0.40 allows for some hunting while still considering the need for sheep recovery and the overall balance of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.20, which is only 13.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to stabilize while still competing with other wolves. This moderate approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.78, which is only 12.5% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still being cautious. A theta of 0.40 reflects a moderate approach that balances the need for wolf reproduction with the sustainability of the sheep population. It allows for gradual adjustments as conditions change, ensuring both species can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.62, which is only 11.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 to 0.35 reflects a balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.92, which is only 10.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem while ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.53, which is only 10.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to sustain itself. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a cautious approach to hunting, promoting balance without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.31, which is only 10.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more moderate hunting intensity is needed to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain its health. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a cautious approach to hunting, balancing the need for sustenance with the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.10, which is only 10.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is a need for the sheep to recover, so I will focus on reducing hunting intensity slightly to allow for their population to stabilize. At the same time, I need to be cautious about the growing wolf population, so a moderate theta will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
