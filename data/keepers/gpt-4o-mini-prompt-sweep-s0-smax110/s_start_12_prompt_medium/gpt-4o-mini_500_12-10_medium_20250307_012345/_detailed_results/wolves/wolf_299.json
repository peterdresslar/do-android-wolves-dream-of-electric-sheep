            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. A moderate theta value will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can stabilize, preventing future crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that they can sustain a slight increase in hunting intensity without causing a crash. A gradual increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment helps maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term survival for both.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 87.7% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep. This moderate adjustment helps maintain a sustainable coexistence as the wolf population is also growing.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual increase is necessary to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while I want to ensure my pack thrives, I also recognize the need to allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and prevent over-depletion of the sheep population, ensuring long-term survival for both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance with the wolf population. This adjustment supports sustainable coexistence, as it encourages sheep recovery while ensuring the wolf population remains healthy.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the wolf population is relatively high. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow sheep to recover while still enabling wolves to thrive. This moderate approach helps maintain balance and avoids depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.28, which is only 29.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from the previous theta of 0.40 to 0.45, I can help ensure the wolf population remains healthy while still allowing the sheep to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.33, which is only 23.0% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help balance the ecosystem and promote sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.10, which is only 18.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is potential for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A moderate increase to 0.500 allows for a balanced approach, enabling us to maintain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.87, which is only 15.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.40 allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still giving sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.67, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 to 0.35 reflects a balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to support reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.09, which is only 11.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be slightly increased to support wolf reproduction, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for wolves to thrive."
