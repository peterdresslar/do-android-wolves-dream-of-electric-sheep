            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 84.2% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 47, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sustainable coexistence. A gradual increase helps maintain balance as both populations fluctuate.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 57.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep. However, with the wolf population also being relatively high, a slight reduction in hunting intensity is prudent to allow for sustainable coexistence and prevent over-depletion of the sheep. This moderate adjustment will help maintain balance while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for recovery. With a wolf population of 68, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is low, suggesting that we should focus on competition among wolves rather than aggressive hunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 38.62, which is only 35.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 30.82, which is only 28.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is some room for hunting, I need to be cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 allows for a balanced approach that supports wolf reproduction while still considering the sustainability of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.26, which is only 22.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a moderate approach, balancing the need to compete with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to sustain our population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",

This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",

This suggests that there is room for the sheep to recover, and a lower hunting intensity will allow for that recovery while still enabling the wolf population to compete effectively. Gradually adjusting to a moderate theta will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderate to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance, ensuring both wolf and sheep populations can thrive without depleting resources too quickly.",

This suggests that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 represents a moderate approach that balances the need for hunting with the necessity of ensuring the sheep population can grow, while also being mindful of the increasing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.43, which is only 10.4% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover.
