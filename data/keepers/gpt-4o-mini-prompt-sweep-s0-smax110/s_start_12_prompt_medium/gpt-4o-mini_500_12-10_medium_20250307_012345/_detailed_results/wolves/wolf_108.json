            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 103, allowing for some increased hunting intensity without risking depletion. However, I must remain cautious as the wolf population is also growing, so a moderate increase in hunting will help maintain balance while ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover and maintain balance in the ecosystem. A gradual approach is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 78.30, which is above 70% of maximum capacity. This allows for a moderate hunting intensity that can sustain both the wolf and sheep populations. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity from 0.65 to 0.60, I can ensure that the sheep population has the opportunity to recover while still allowing for some hunting to support the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring long-term survival for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 68, which is relatively high, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition among wolves, ensuring both populations can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the wolf population is relatively high. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining enough food for the wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of balancing our needs with the ecosystem",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 30.82, which is only 28.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I can increase my hunting intensity slightly, I must do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A theta of 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still giving sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.26, which is only 22.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I can increase my hunting intensity slightly, I need to be cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate increase to 0.40 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.85, which is only 18.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is some opportunity for hunting, it is crucial to avoid overexploitation to allow the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 reflects a more cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.04, which is only 15.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.02, which is only 13.7% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing competition with other wolves, which will help balance the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.55, which is only 12.3% of its maximum capacity. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.32, it is crucial to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while also reducing competition among wolves as the population grows.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I need to maintain a balance, a slight increase in hunting intensity will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. This moderate adjustment allows for sustainable coexistence as I monitor the trends in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.86, which is only 10.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A slight decrease from my previous theta will help balance our competition with other wolves and the need for sustainable hunting."
