            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. A lower theta allows for competition among wolves, which can help control our numbers while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This approach supports long-term sustainability and avoids depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 3.79, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity slightly to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also be cautious to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A small increase allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, I must remain cautious and avoid overhunting, as the wolf population is still relatively low. A gradual increase will help maintain balance and ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 87.7% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 46, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both populations. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to ensure that we do not over-deplete the sheep, especially as they are at 75.4% of their maximum capacity. A moderate theta allows for some growth in the wolf population while still keeping an eye on the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover gradually. A moderate increase from my previous theta reflects the need to adapt to the current conditions without risking a sudden depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term health of both populations. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to ensure that the sheep can recover while also allowing the wolf population to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment reflects the need to maintain a healthy wolf population while also considering the gradual recovery of the sheep. A moderate increase will support reproduction among wolves while still allowing for coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.28, which is only 29.3% of its maximum capacity. While my previous theta of 0.450 allowed for some hunting, I need to be cautious and reduce my hunting intensity slightly to allow the sheep population to recover. This adjustment will help ensure a sustainable balance between wolves and sheep, avoiding overhunting while still allowing for some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.33, which is only 23.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for more hunting intensity while still being cautious, as the wolf population is relatively high at 66.00. This approach aims to balance the needs of both wolves and sheep, ensuring long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.10, which is only 18.3% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, allowing for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.87, which is only 15.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is some opportunity for hunting, it is crucial to avoid overexploitation to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 reflects a balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.67, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we can afford to increase our hunting intensity slightly to help sustain our wolf population without depleting the sheep too rapidly. A gradual increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing our immediate needs.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.09 and only 11.9% of its maximum capacity. A moderate hunting intensity will allow for some hunting while still enabling the sheep to recover. This approach helps maintain a balance between our population and the sheep, ensuring long-term survival for both."
