            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 195\n- Sheep population: 12.79\n- Wolf population: 41.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.350\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.31 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 11.6% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and while I want to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I also need to allow for some hunting to maintain our reproductive success. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help balance the populations without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This will help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A moderate adjustment keeps us responsive to the ecosystem",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still healthy at 90.42, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This value balances the need to ensure wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover and maintain sustainability. It reflects a cautious approach to avoid over-depletion of sheep as wolf numbers are also significant.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the sheep population at 68.4% of maximum capacity, I can maintain a moderate hunting intensity to ensure both wolf and sheep populations remain healthy. This adjustment allows for gradual changes without risking depletion of the sheep or overpopulation of wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 53.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 66, which is relatively high compared to the sheep, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain balance while allowing the sheep population to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 41.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, which is relatively high, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that supports both sheep recovery and wolf population stability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.59, which is only 25.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is some opportunity for hunting, it is crucial to prioritize the recovery of the sheep population to ensure long-term sustainability. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while also focusing on competition with other wolves, helping to stabilize both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.17, which is only 20.2% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still being cautious. By raising theta from 0.35 to 0.40, I can begin to capitalize on the available sheep without overexploiting the population, ensuring both wolves and sheep can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.38, which is only 16.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing our need for sustenance with the necessity of not depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.98, which is only 14.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.90, which is only 12.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.400 to 0.350, I can still maintain some hunting activity while prioritizing the sustainability of both populations. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
