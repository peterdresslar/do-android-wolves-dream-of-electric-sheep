            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating a need to reduce hunting intensity to allow for recovery. A moderate theta value will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can stabilize, promoting long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 3.79, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is close to its maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be increased slightly to ensure the wolf population can thrive. However, I must be cautious and avoid drastic changes, so a small increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that supports both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high at 103, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a sustainable balance. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a slight reduction in hunting intensity to ensure sustainable coexistence. This adjustment will help maintain a balance as the wolf population grows, preventing overhunting while still allowing for some reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 78.30, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sustainable coexistence. A moderate increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for gradual adaptation to the current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but with the wolf population also being relatively high, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 68, which is relatively high, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for more hunting while still promoting coexistence and preventing depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 35.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a wolf population of 68, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is low, suggesting that we should focus on a balanced approach to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining our own population. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help ensure sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 30.82, which is only 28.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is some room for increased hunting, we should be cautious. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 allows for a balanced approach to hunting while still considering the need for sheep recovery and the sustainability of our wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.26, which is only 22.1% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.85, which is only 18.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.4 to 0.35, I can maintain a focus on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring that both populations can stabilize and thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.04, which is only 15.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.02, which is only 13.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.350 allows for some hunting to support our wolf population without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance."
