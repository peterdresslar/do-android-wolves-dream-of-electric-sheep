However, with the wolf population at 70, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to prevent a crash in the sheep population. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance while allowing for some growth in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.19, which is only 23.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while I can increase hunting intensity, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still giving the sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.63, which is only 18.8% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, promoting coexistence while still allowing for some hunting.",

This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on the competition with other wolves, ensuring a balanced approach that supports both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.63, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting without risking depletion. Increasing theta slightly from 0.35 to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach that supports wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery.",

This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need to compete with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to support our population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable ecosystem.",
