            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must also be cautious not to deplete the sheep too quickly. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring both populations can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is at 48.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With the wolf population at 68, which is relatively high, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach that balances the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 37.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69.00, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.75, which is only 28.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity should be increased to support wolf reproduction, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the immediate needs of the wolf population."
