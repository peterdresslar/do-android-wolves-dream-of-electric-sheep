            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 127\n- Sheep population: 13.55\n- Wolf population: 42.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.350\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.32 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 12.3% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a sustainable balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still healthy at 103, which allows for a moderate hunting intensity. This will help maintain a sustainable balance while ensuring that the wolf population can thrive without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight reduction from my previous theta acknowledges the growing wolf population and the need to prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 84.2% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 47, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, and while I want to maintain a balance, I also need to be cautious as the wolf population is growing. A slight reduction in hunting intensity allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing sheep to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.72, it is wise to maintain a balanced approach to ensure the sheep can recover while also allowing for some hunting to support the wolf population. A slight decrease from my previous theta will help prevent overhunting and promote sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 35.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a wolf population of 68, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is relatively low at 0.57, suggesting that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while maintaining a healthy wolf population. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help balance our needs and ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 30.82, which is only 28.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.26, which is only 22.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting sustainability while still considering the need to compete with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.85, which is only 18.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I aim to balance the need for hunting with the necessity of allowing the sheep population to increase, while also being mindful of the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.04, which is only 15.5% of its maximum capacity. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.32, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.02, which is only 13.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some recovery of the sheep population while still ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the wolf population is relatively high. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help sustain our population while allowing the sheep to recover gradually. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and responding to the current state of the ecosystem."
