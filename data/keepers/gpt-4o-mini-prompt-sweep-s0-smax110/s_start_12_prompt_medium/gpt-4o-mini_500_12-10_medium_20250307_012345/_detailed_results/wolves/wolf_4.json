            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low relative to the maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are more wolves than sheep. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, enabling us to hunt enough to support our population while giving sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment helps maintain a sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.61, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. It reflects a cautious approach, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.31, which is only 12.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need to adapt to the changing conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level (12.8% of maximum capacity), and while it is important to hunt for our survival, I must also consider the long-term health of the sheep population. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still providing enough sustenance for the wolf pack. This moderate approach helps maintain balance and avoids depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, I must remain cautious as the wolf population is also growing. A moderate adjustment will help maintain balance while ensuring both populations can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while I want to ensure my pack thrives, I also recognize the importance of allowing the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and prevent over-depletion of the sheep population."
