            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and a moderate hunting intensity will allow for sustainable coexistence while also considering the gradual increase in wolf numbers. This approach helps maintain balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 83.41, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while ensuring we don",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, but the wolf population is also significant. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling us to compete effectively with other wolves. This approach supports long-term sustainability and avoids depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 48.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 68.00, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 37.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 69.00, it is wise to maintain a balanced approach to avoid over-depleting the sheep. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.75, which is only 28.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is some room for increased hunting, it is crucial to be cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still giving sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.28, which is only 23.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased slightly, it is crucial to avoid overexploitation. A small increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting the recovery of sheep while still enabling wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.62, which is only 18.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for the sheep to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus slightly more on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring that both populations can stabilize and thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.66, which is only 16.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.20, which is only 13.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, ensuring we do not over-deplete the sheep while also considering the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.78, which is only 12.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is potential for recovery if I reduce my hunting intensity slightly. By increasing theta to 0.40, I can maintain a balance that allows for some hunting while also giving the sheep a chance to rebound, ensuring long-term sustainability for both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.62, which is only 11.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize without depleting their numbers further. This moderate approach supports long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.92, which is only 10.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should be cautious with our hunting to allow the sheep to recover. However, with a moderate wolf population of 35, a slight increase in hunting intensity to 0.40 will help maintain our numbers while still being mindful of the sheep",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.31, which is only 10.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep can recover if we reduce hunting intensity slightly. By increasing theta from 0.35 to 0.40, I aim to strike a balance that allows for some hunting while still giving the sheep a chance to rebound, ensuring long-term sustainability for both wolves and sheep."
