            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 60\n- Sheep population: 12.62\n- Wolf population: 39.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.350\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.32 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 11.5% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and while I want to maintain a healthy wolf population, I also need to ensure that we can continue to hunt effectively. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for sustainable hunting while still enabling some recovery for the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is close to its maximum capacity, indicating that they are thriving. A moderate hunting intensity will allow us to maintain a sustainable balance while still supporting our wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 95.85, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 46, it's important to avoid overhunting to ensure our long-term survival. A theta of 0.55 strikes a balance between maintaining our numbers and allowing the sheep to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because it represents a balanced approach to hunting and competing with other wolves. The sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and maintaining a moderate hunting intensity will help ensure the long-term survival of both species. This adjustment allows for gradual adaptation to the current conditions without risking depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, but I want to ensure that we don",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 48.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 68.00, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 37.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.75, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we are nearing a critical point for sustainability. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain its health. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for a balanced coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.28, which is only 23.0% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.62, which is only 18.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.66, which is only 16.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting to maintain our wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.4 to 0.35 reflects a balanced strategy that prioritizes sustainability and gradual adjustment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.20, which is only 13.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.78, which is only 12.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, allowing for some hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.62, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment aims to balance our needs for reproduction while still considering the sustainability of the sheep population. A gradual increase helps maintain stability in the ecosystem."
