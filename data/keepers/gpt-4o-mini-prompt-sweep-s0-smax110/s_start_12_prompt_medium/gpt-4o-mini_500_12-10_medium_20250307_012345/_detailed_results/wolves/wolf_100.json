            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that they can sustain some hunting pressure without immediate risk of depletion. However, with a relatively high wolf population, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A moderate increase in hunting intensity allows for some reproduction while still considering the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help sustain both populations while still allowing for some growth in the wolf pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 103, which allows for a moderate hunting intensity that can sustain both the wolf and sheep populations. This value balances the need for hunting to support wolf reproduction while also considering the health of the sheep population, avoiding overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still healthy at 84.2% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring the sheep can recover if needed. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This balance helps maintain the ecosystem without risking a depletion of sheep or an overpopulation of wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 57.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. A slight reduction from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, focusing on maintaining both wolf and sheep populations while adapting to the current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still being mindful of the wolf population growth. This adjustment helps ensure that both populations can thrive without leading to depletion or overcompetition.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 35.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 68, which is relatively high, I need to be cautious about overhunting. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain a healthy population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 30.82, which is only 28.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.26, which is only 22.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is some room for hunting, it is essential to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the competition with other wolves, which is necessary given the current wolf population of 64. This approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.85, which is only 18.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some reproduction among wolves while still enabling the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting sustainability without risking a rapid decline in sheep numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.04, which is only 15.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 will help balance hunting with the need to compete with other wolves, ensuring sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.02, which is only 13.7% of its maximum capacity. While I need to maintain a balance between hunting and competing with other wolves, a slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.55, which is only 12.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate increase to 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population and maintaining a balance with the current wolf numbers."
