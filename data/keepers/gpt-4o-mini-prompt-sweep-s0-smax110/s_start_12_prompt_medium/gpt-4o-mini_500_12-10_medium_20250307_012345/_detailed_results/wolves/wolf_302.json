            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 337\n- Sheep population: 11.99\n- Wolf population: 39.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.400\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.31 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 10.9% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A lower theta will help reduce competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to stabilize, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still close to its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while ensuring that the sheep can recover. This adjustment supports the long-term survival of both species and maintains a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 96.42, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while I want to ensure my pack thrives, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain balance as the wolf population is relatively stable. This approach supports long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations while still allowing for some growth in the wolf pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 49.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 67, which is relatively high, I need to be cautious and avoid over-hunting. A slight decrease in theta allows for a balanced approach that supports both sheep recovery and wolf population stability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment reflects a balance between ensuring the wolf population remains healthy while allowing sheep to recover and thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.28, which is only 29.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is some room for hunting, I need to be cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, enabling the sheep to recover while still allowing for some hunting to sustain the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.33, which is only 23.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for more hunting intensity while still being cautious, as the wolf population is relatively high. This approach aims to balance the needs of both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.10, which is only 18.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from the previous theta of 0.450 to 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, promoting a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a need for caution. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This moderate approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.67, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support our wolf population without depleting the sheep further, promoting a more sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.09, which is only 11.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some reproduction among wolves while still giving sheep a chance to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach, promoting coexistence without risking a rapid decline in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.99, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a significant competition for resources. A lower theta allows for a focus on competing with other wolves, which can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem."
