            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 68, which is relatively high, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A moderate increase to 0.4 allows for some hunting while still considering the need for balance and the potential for sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 35.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a wolf population of 68, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is low, suggesting that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. This moderate theta will help balance hunting and competition among wolves, ensuring sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 30.82, which is only 28.0% of its maximum capacity. While I need to focus on hunting to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.26, which is only 22.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 allows for more hunting intensity while still being cautious, as the wolf population is relatively high at 64. I aim to maintain a balance that supports both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.85, which is only 18.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 allows for a moderate focus on competition with other wolves while still permitting some hunting, ensuring that both populations can stabilize and thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.04, which is only 15.5% of its maximum capacity. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.32, it is crucial to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.02, which is only 13.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.30 to 0.35, I can still focus on maintaining a balance while allowing for some growth in the sheep population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of avoiding sudden changes and responding to the current state of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.55, which is only 12.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.56, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we are competing for limited resources. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our own population. This gradual adjustment helps ensure long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.86, which is only 10.8% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, a slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted to take advantage of the current sheep population while still allowing for recovery. This moderate adjustment helps maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep, promoting sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.43, which is only 10.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is a need to allow the sheep to recover while also considering the growing wolf population. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, ensuring both populations can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.20, which is only 10.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should be cautious with our hunting to allow the sheep to recover. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.43, there is still some opportunity for hunting without depleting the sheep population too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting both wolf reproduction and sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.08, which is only 10.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 reflects a balanced approach that supports both the sheep",
