            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 70.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with the wolf population at 58, it is wise to maintain a balanced approach to avoid over-depleting the sheep while still ensuring our pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 56.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.95, a moderate approach will help maintain balance while allowing both populations to thrive. This adjustment also considers the growing wolf population, which suggests a need to be cautious with hunting intensity.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term survival of both species. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance as the wolf population is also relatively high.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still considering the need to maintain a balance with the sheep population. A gradual increase is prudent to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.19, which is only 25.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is potential for recovery in the sheep population if I reduce hunting intensity. By lowering theta slightly, I can focus more on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep to recover, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.01, which is only 20% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for the sheep to recover. By setting a theta of 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.26, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking over-depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.60, which is only 14.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting a theta of 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This gradual adjustment will help ensure a sustainable balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.78, which is only 12.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting without risking the depletion of the sheep. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.35 to 0.40, I can enhance my hunting efforts while still allowing for the sheep population to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.51, which is only 11.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support our wolf population without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.61, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.99, which is only 10.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing our need for sustenance with the long-term health of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.59, which is only 9.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance while still considering the need for wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.29, which is only 9.4% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, a slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted to take advantage of the current sheep numbers without depleting them too quickly. This adjustment allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.40, which is only 9.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover.
