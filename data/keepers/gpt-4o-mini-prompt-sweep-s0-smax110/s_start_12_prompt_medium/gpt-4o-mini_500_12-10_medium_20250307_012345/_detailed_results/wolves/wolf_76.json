            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 89.4% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term health of both populations. This gradual adjustment will help maintain balance as the wolf population is low, and it allows for some recovery of sheep without risking overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is close to its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively low. A lower theta allows for a focus on competition with other wolves, which can help stabilize our numbers while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
