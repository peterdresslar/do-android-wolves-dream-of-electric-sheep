            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is key to avoiding sudden population crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.50, which is only 32.3% of its maximum capacity. While I want to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, allowing both populations to stabilize without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.59, which is only 25.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need to compete with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.17, which is only 20.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is some opportunity for hunting, it is essential to maintain a cautious approach to allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease from my previous theta of 0.45 will help balance the need for hunting with the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.38, which is only 16.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is some opportunity for hunting, it is crucial to avoid overexploitation to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.4 to 0.35 reflects a cautious approach that balances the need for sustenance with the long-term health of both populations.",

This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach that supports wolf reproduction while still being mindful of the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.90, which is only 12.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to stabilize while still competing with other wolves. This moderate approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",

This gradual adjustment will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",

This adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring both can thrive in the long term. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.35 aligns with the wisdom of making small adjustments in response to current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. By slightly decreasing my hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both sheep and wolves while still competing with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.87, which is only 9.9% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population, while also allowing for some competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.98, which is only 10.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should be cautious with our hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.23, which is only 11.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own wolf population. A slight increase in hunting intensity from my previous theta will help maintain our numbers without depleting the sheep too quickly. This moderate approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",

To allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population, I will focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intense hunting. This moderate adjustment will help ensure long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.04, which is only 12.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery."
