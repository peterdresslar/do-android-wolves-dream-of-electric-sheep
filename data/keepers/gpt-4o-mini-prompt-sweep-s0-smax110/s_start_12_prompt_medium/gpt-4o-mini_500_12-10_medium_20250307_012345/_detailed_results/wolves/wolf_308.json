            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 338\n- Sheep population: 11.39\n- Wolf population: 35.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.400\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.33 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 10.4% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is close to its maximum capacity, and a moderate hunting intensity will allow for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves. This adjustment reflects a careful balance, considering both the current sheep population and the need to avoid over-depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently healthy at 96.42, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction without significantly depleting the sheep population. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio of 2.10, a moderate increase to 0.45 allows for sustainable coexistence as we monitor both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 82.94, but the wolf population is also significant at 55.00. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling us to compete effectively with other wolves. This approach promotes a sustainable balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without overly depleting the sheep population, ensuring long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 49.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 67, which is relatively high, I need to be cautious about overhunting. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain a healthy population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still being cautious. This adjustment reflects the need to balance the wolf population growth with the sheep recovery, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.28, which is only 29.3% of its maximum capacity. While I want to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I also recognize the need to allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, allowing both populations to stabilize without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.33, which is only 23.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for increased hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction. However, since the wolf population is relatively high at 66.00, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight increase to 0.45 allows for a balanced approach that promotes sustainability while still enabling some growth in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.10, which is only 18.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight decrease in hunting intensity from my previous theta allows for a more balanced approach, giving sheep a chance to recover while still ensuring the wolf population remains healthy.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.87, which is only 15.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, reducing hunting intensity while still ensuring our survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.67, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some replenishment of the sheep population while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without risking a rapid decline in sheep numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.09, which is only 11.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our needs without depleting the sheep further, promoting a healthier balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.99, which is only 10.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting sustainability without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.39, which is only 10.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance."
