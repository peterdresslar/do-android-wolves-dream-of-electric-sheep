            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 353\n- Sheep population: 17.31\n- Wolf population: 6.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.400\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 2.88 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 15.7% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain our wolf population while ensuring that the sheep do not become too depleted. A gradual adjustment is key to avoiding sudden population crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly, and this balance supports long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 29.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 69, which is relatively high, I need to be cautious about overhunting. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still enabling the sheep population to recover and maintain balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.33, which is only 23.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I need to maintain some hunting to support wolf reproduction, I should also be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A slight reduction from my previous theta allows for a more balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.10, which is only 18.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.87, which is only 15.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a presence in the hunting realm. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support our wolf population without depleting the sheep further, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.67, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting without risking the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.09, which is only 11.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, reducing hunting intensity while still competing with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be increased slightly to support wolf reproduction. However, I must be cautious and avoid overhunting to allow the sheep population to recover. A gradual increase in theta will help maintain balance without risking a crash in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity to ensure the survival of my pack, I must do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for sustainable hunting while still considering the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.80, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 strikes a balance between competing with other wolves and allowing the sheep population to stabilize, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.53, which is only 9.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is a need to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a slight focus on hunting to support our wolf population. A small increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach that considers both the immediate needs of the wolf pack and the long-term sustainability of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.39, which is only 9.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a moderate approach, focusing more on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.41, which is only 9.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some recovery of the sheep while also ensuring the wolf population remains healthy.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.54, which is only 9.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.4 to 0.35, I can focus more on competing with other wolves and reducing hunting intensity, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.18, which is only 10.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while still competing with other wolves. This moderate adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we are nearing a critical point. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help sustain our population without depleting the sheep too quickly. This adjustment allows for a gradual balance between hunting and competition with other wolves.",
