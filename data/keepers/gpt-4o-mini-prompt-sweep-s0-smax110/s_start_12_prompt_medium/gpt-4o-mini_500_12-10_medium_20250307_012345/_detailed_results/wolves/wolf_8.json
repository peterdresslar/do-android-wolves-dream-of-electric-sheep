To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves while allowing the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help maintain balance and prevent overhunting, which could lead to a crash in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution in hunting to avoid depleting their numbers. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the sustainability of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach that considers both the current sheep population and the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while ensuring that the sheep can recover. This adjustment supports the long-term survival of both species, as it allows for a sustainable balance without risking a rapid decline in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to maintain balance, considering the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sustainable coexistence. A moderate increase from my previous theta allows for gradual adaptation to the changing conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while I want to ensure the wolves can thrive, I also need to allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and prevent over-depletion of the sheep, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 48.0% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.78, a moderate increase to 0.45 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring both populations can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 37.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the long-term health of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.75, which is only 28.9% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep population while still allowing for some hunting. A theta of 0.35 reflects a moderate approach that balances my need to hunt with the necessity of letting the sheep recover, avoiding overexploitation."
