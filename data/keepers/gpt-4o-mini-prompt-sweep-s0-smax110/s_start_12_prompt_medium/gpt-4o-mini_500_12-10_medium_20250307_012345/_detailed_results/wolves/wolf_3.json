            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.00, which is only 10.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for the sheep to recover, and a moderate hunting intensity will allow for sustainable coexistence while still enabling the wolf population to thrive. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity from the previous theta of 0.500, I can help ensure that both populations remain healthy.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.61, which is only 11.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, ensuring that we do not over-deplete the sheep while still competing effectively with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment reflects a balance between ensuring the wolf population can thrive while allowing the sheep to recover and maintain their numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while I want to ensure my pack thrives, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and prevent over-depletion of the sheep, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
