            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 337\n- Sheep population: 11.99\n- Wolf population: 39.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.350\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.31 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 10.9% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking a rapid depletion of their numbers. This adjustment supports our reproductive needs while still considering the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction. However, I must remain cautious and avoid overhunting, as the wolf population is still relatively low. A moderate increase will help maintain balance without risking a crash in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 96.42, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that can sustain both populations. This value reflects a balanced approach, ensuring that while I continue to hunt, I do not overly deplete the sheep, allowing for their recovery and the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that can support both wolf reproduction and sheep recovery. This balance will help maintain sustainable coexistence while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while I want to ensure my pack thrives, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and prevent depletion of the sheep population, which is crucial for our long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery. A gradual increase is essential to maintain balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level relative to the maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are not enough sheep to sustain aggressive hunting. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain its health. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.28, which is only 29.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I need to maintain some hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I should also be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still recognizing the need for sustainable hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.33, which is only 23.0% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.450 to 0.40 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for hunting with the importance of sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.10, which is only 18.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach, promoting sustainability without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.87, which is only 15.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for sustenance with the long-term health of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.67, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking the depletion of the sheep population. A moderate increase to 0.40 will help maintain a balance, allowing for some reproduction among wolves while still being mindful of the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.09, which is only 11.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for some hunting without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.99, which is only 10.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach that considers both the immediate need for sustenance and the long-term health of the ecosystem."
