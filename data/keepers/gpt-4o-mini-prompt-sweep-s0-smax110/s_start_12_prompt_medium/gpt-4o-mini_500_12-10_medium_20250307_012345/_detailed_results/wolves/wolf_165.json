            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 194\n- Sheep population: 13.90\n- Wolf population: 46.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.400\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.30 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 12.6% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is at maximum capacity, indicating that we should reduce hunting intensity to allow for recovery. A moderate theta value will help maintain a balance between our needs and the sustainability of the sheep population, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A balanced approach will help maintain both sheep and wolf populations sustainably, avoiding depletion while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 102.15, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity while ensuring the sheep can recover. This value reflects a balanced approach, allowing for sustainable coexistence as the wolf population is also growing. It is important to avoid drastic changes, so a small adjustment from my previous theta of 0.50 will help maintain stability in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 82.2% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep. This moderate adjustment will help maintain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 68.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with a wolf population of 59, it is important to maintain a balance to avoid over-depleting the sheep. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for sustainable hunting while still considering the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 53.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population being slightly higher than the sheep population, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 41.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level relative to the maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both the sheep and the wolf population while still maintaining a focus on competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.59, which is only 25.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for increased hunting without risking immediate depletion. However, with the wolf population at 68.00, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the sustainability of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.17, which is only 20.2% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I also recognize the importance of allowing the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, allowing both populations to stabilize without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.38, which is only 16.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from the previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35, I can still maintain some hunting activity while prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.98, which is only 14.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I can increase my hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. A moderate increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of the wolf pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.90, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance, ensuring both the wolf and sheep populations can stabilize without depleting the sheep too quickly."
