            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and my previous theta was quite low. By increasing it to 0.30, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover. This gradual adjustment helps maintain a balance between hunting and competition, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help sustain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover and thrive. A gradual increase is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction without overly depleting the sheep population, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 57.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population being slightly higher than the sheep population, I need to prioritize competition among wolves to prevent overhunting. A moderate decrease in hunting intensity will allow for a balance that supports both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 68, it is wise to focus on competition among wolves to prevent overhunting and allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring our long-term survival while also allowing for gradual recovery of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 30.82, which is only 28.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still being mindful of the wolf population growth.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.26, which is only 22.1% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still competing with other wolves. A moderate theta value of 0.35 will help maintain a balance, reducing the pressure on the sheep while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.85, which is only 18.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase to 0.40 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.04, which is only 15.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to allow the sheep to recover while also considering the growing wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support our needs without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.02, which is only 13.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring the long-term survival of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain balance and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.86, which is only 10.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still giving sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.43, which is only 10.4% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still being cautious. A gradual increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for some hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly. It also considers the current wolf population of 30, which is relatively high, so I need to be mindful of not overhunting."
