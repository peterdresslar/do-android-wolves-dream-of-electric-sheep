            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 338\n- Sheep population: 11.39\n- Wolf population: 35.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.350\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.33 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 10.4% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 95.7% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, I want to avoid overhunting and ensure that both sheep and wolves can thrive in the long term. A moderate reduction from my previous theta allows for sustainable coexistence while still supporting wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still healthy at 96.42, allowing for some increased hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction. However, I must remain cautious and avoid overhunting, as the sheep are nearing their maximum capacity. A moderate reduction from my previous theta allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling growth in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while I want to maintain a healthy wolf population, I also recognize the need to gradually increase hunting intensity to support reproduction. A theta of 0.65 allows for a balanced approach that encourages coexistence while still enabling us to take advantage of the current sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that can support wolf reproduction while still enabling the sheep to recover. This approach maintains a balance between competing with other wolves and hunting, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate approach helps maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term survival for both.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 38.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both species can thrive. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are not enough sheep to support aggressive hunting. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain its health. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.33, which is only 23.0% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A moderate increase from my previous theta of 0.400 will help maintain balance while being cautious not to overhunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.10, which is only 18.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing competition with other wolves, helping to stabilize both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.87, which is only 15.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the immediate needs of the wolf pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.67, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover rather than intensifying hunting. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for some hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.09, which is only 11.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for sustainable cycles.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.99, which is only 10.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to recover while still enabling my pack to compete with other wolves. A gradual increase in hunting intensity can be considered if the sheep population begins to rise.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.39, which is only 10.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting without risking depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach that can support wolf reproduction while still enabling the sheep population to recover."
