            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 47\n- Sheep population: 109.32\n- Wolf population: 33.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.391\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 3.31 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 99.4% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and while it is important to maintain a healthy wolf population, I need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while still enabling the sheep to stabilize and grow, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is close to its maximum capacity, indicating that they can sustain a bit more hunting without risking depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for more hunting while still maintaining a balance that supports both wolf and sheep populations. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of adapting to changing conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because it represents a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balanced approach. The sheep population is healthy, and a small adjustment allows for sustainable coexistence as I respond to the current conditions without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing sheep to recover. It reflects a balanced approach, considering both the current state and the trends in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This approach balances our needs with the ecosystem",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 48.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.78, I need to be cautious about hunting too aggressively to avoid depleting the sheep population. A slight decrease in hunting intensity allows for a more sustainable balance while still enabling wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 37.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, it is wise to avoid overhunting to prevent a crash in sheep numbers. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that supports both sheep recovery and wolf population health.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low relative to the maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. A lower theta allows for more competition among wolves, which can help stabilize our numbers while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.28, which is only 23.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach while still being mindful of the need to compete with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.62, which is only 18.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 reflects a balanced approach, focusing on competition among wolves while still allowing for some hunting to support reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.66, which is only 16.1% of its maximum capacity. While I need to focus on hunting to ensure the survival of my pack, I must also be cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that supports both hunting and the recovery of sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.20, which is only 13.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is some opportunity for hunting, it is crucial to prioritize the recovery of the sheep population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.78, which is only 12.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.62, which is only 11.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to allow the sheep to recover.
