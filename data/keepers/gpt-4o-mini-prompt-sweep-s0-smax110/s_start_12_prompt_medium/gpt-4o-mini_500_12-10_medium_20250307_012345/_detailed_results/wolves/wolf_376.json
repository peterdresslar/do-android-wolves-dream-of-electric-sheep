            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 411\n- Sheep population: 10.59\n- Wolf population: 37.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.300\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.29 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 9.6% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, but the wolf population is also significant. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on maintaining a balance. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing competition with other wolves, which will help stabilize our numbers and allow the sheep to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but I want to ensure that we do not overhunt and deplete their numbers. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population. This will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking over-depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring both can thrive in the long term.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.34, which is only 31.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the sustainability of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 23.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.38, it is wise to focus on competition with other wolves to allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a sustainable wolf population. A gradual adjustment towards lower hunting intensity will help balance the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.63, which is only 18.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.09, which is only 15.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for sustenance with the long-term health of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.63, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.35 helps maintain balance and allows for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.50, which is only 11.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support our wolf population without risking a rapid depletion of the sheep, ensuring a more sustainable balance.",

To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be increased slightly to support wolf reproduction while still allowing for some recovery of the sheep population.
