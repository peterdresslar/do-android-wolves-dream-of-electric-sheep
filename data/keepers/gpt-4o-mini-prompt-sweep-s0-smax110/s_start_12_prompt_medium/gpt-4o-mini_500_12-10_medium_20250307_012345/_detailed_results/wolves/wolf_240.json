            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 266\n- Sheep population: 11.12\n- Wolf population: 37.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.350\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.30 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 10.1% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and a moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations. This adjustment allows for sustainable coexistence while also considering the gradual increase in wolf numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still healthy at 93.34, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while remaining cautious. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction without risking a rapid depletion of the sheep population. A moderate increase from my previous theta maintains balance and promotes coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still maintaining a sustainable balance with the sheep population. Given that the sheep are at 72.3% of their maximum capacity, a gradual increase in hunting is appropriate to prevent overpopulation of sheep and ensure long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight reduction in hunting intensity to maintain balance. This will help ensure the sheep can recover while still allowing for some hunting to support the wolf population. A gradual approach is essential to avoid sudden fluctuations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 69, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both populations can thrive. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.99, which is only 32.7% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, allowing both populations to stabilize without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.74, which is only 25.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for moderate hunting without risking depletion. A theta of 0.45 allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term survival of both sheep and wolves. It reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for wolf reproduction with the necessity of maintaining a sustainable sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.26, which is only 19.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting strategy to ensure our own survival. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach that balances our need to hunt with the necessity of not depleting the sheep population further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.37, which is only 15.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.83, which is only 13.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from the previous theta of 0.40 to 0.35, I can balance the need for sustenance with the long-term survival of both species, avoiding overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.10, which is only 11.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for gradual hunting without risking the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.78, which is only 10.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while being cautious not to over-deplete the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.12, which is only 10.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting without risking depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still being mindful of the sheep"
