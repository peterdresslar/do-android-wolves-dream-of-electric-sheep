            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 49.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.81, it is essential to maintain a balance that allows both populations to thrive. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help ensure the sheep can recover while still allowing for some hunting to support the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population also being relatively high, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both species can thrive. A gradual increase to 0.45 reflects a balanced approach that supports my pack while allowing the sheep to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 29.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 69, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.33, which is only 23.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for more hunting intensity while still being cautious, as the wolf population is relatively high at 66.00. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.10, which is only 18.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is some opportunity for hunting, it is crucial to allow the sheep to recover. By adopting a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves and ensure that the sheep population has a chance to grow, maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem."
