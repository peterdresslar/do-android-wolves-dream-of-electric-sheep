            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and reduce competition for the remaining prey. This strategy allows me to adapt to the changing environment and increases my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased slightly, indicating a stable food source. However, the number of wolves remains the same, which means competition is still present. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.45, I can take advantage of the available sheep while still being cautious about overexerting myself, ensuring I have enough energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and failure. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and adapt to the changing environment while still contributing to the pack's success.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population decreasing and the number of wolves remaining stable, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to balance the need for food with the risk of overhunting. This way, I can still contribute to the pack while ensuring my own survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population increasing slightly and the number of wolves remaining constant, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to balance the need for food while minimizing competition with other wolves. This way, I can still secure enough resources without overexerting myself or risking injury.",
