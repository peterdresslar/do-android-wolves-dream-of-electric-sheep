            "I chose this theta because while the number of sheep remains constant, the competition among wolves is still present. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can improve my chances of securing food without overexerting myself, which could lead to unnecessary risks. This balance allows me to remain competitive while conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population increasing slightly and the number of wolves remaining constant, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food while avoiding overexertion. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and adapt to the changing dynamics of the prey population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests competition is still fierce. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can take advantage of the sheep while still being cautious about the risks posed by other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. With fewer wolves around, I can afford to be more strategic and conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's survival. A slightly lower intensity allows me to balance my needs with the current dynamics of the environment.",
