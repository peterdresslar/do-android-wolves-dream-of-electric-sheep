            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the increased number of wolves. A lower hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because with 46.08 sheep and 12 wolves, the competition for food is still significant. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of securing enough food without overexerting myself, as the sheep population is relatively high. This balance allows me to hunt effectively while also conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population means competition for food is rising. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can better secure my share of the sheep while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a more competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and ensure my survival without risking depletion of resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population increasing slightly and the number of wolves remaining the same, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I have enough energy for survival while still contributing to the pack's needs. A moderate intensity allows me to be effective without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a crowded environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can take advantage of the current situation without overexerting myself, allowing for a balance between hunting success and energy conservation. This way, I can still contribute to the pack while ensuring my own survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the increased number of wolves. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased slightly, which may provide a better opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. By increasing my intensity from 0.40 to 0.50, I can balance the need to hunt effectively while still conserving energy in case the situation changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food will be higher. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts.

            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the increase in wolves means competition for food is higher. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population at 48.80 and the wolf population stable at 20.00, there is a reasonable amount of prey available. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly from my previous theta of 0.40 to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while not overexerting myself, which could lead to unnecessary risks. This way, I can ensure my survival while still being mindful of the competition from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. However, the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I aim to balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion, ensuring I can still compete effectively without exhausting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because with an increase in the wolf population and a decrease in sheep, hunting at full intensity may lead to competition with other wolves for limited prey. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid direct confrontation while still contributing to the pack's success.",
            "I chose this theta because with 47.14 sheep and 22 wolves, the competition is high. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. This balance allows me to avoid overexertion and increases my chances of survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the increase in the wolf population, competition for food is becoming fiercer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can improve my chances of securing enough food while still being cautious not to overexert myself, as the sheep population has decreased. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and avoid overexertion, ensuring my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy and avoid competition while still allowing for opportunistic hunting if the chance arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased slightly, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still being cautious, as the number of wolves remains the same. This approach allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can better compete with other wolves while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the increase in the wolf population means competition for food is higher. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid drawing attention while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy. This balanced approach helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting may be more challenging. By increasing my intensity slightly from 0.65 to 0.75, I can improve my chances of successfully hunting while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, which means hunting at maximum intensity may not be necessary. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This balance helps ensure my survival in a changing environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can improve my chances of successfully catching prey while still conserving energy compared to maximum intensity. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with the number of wolves remaining constant, hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the wolf population is also declining. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are likely hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to survive longer while waiting for a more favorable situation.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the reduced number of wolves. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can take advantage of the current situation without overexerting myself, ensuring I have enough energy for future hunts while still contributing to my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high, and I need to balance the risk of competing with other wolves for food. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the current sheep population while still being cautious, given the recent decrease in both sheep and wolf numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the population of sheep is relatively low, and the number of wolves has decreased significantly. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the number of wolves, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves for the same prey. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct confrontation, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests competition is fierce. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can take advantage of the available prey while still being cautious about the risks posed by other wolves.",
