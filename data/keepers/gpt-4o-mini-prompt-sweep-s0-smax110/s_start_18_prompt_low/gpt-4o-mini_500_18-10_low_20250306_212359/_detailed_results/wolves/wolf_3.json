            "I chose this theta because with 10 wolves and only 18 sheep, hunting at full intensity could lead to overhunting and depletion of resources. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and ensure that there are enough sheep left for future hunts, while still contributing to the pack's survival.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population increasing and the number of wolves remaining constant, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to balance the need for food while avoiding overexertion. This way, I can still secure enough resources without competing too aggressively with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, but the wolf population has decreased. A lower hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still taking advantage of the available prey. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, with the number of wolves decreasing, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food while avoiding overexertion. A moderate intensity of 0.50 allows me to be efficient without risking depletion of my energy.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. By increasing my intensity slightly to 0.65, I can take advantage of the higher availability of prey while still being cautious, as the number of wolves remains the same. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. With the recent decrease in the wolf population, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This balance increases my chances of survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. By adjusting my intensity slightly above my previous level, I can take advantage of the increased prey while still conserving energy in case the competition from other wolves intensifies.",
