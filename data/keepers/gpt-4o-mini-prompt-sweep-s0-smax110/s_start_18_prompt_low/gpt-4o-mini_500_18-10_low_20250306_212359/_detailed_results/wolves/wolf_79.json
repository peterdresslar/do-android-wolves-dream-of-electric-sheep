By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy while still being active enough to catch prey when opportunities arise. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can improve my chances of securing enough food while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival as the competition with other wolves remains constant.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.5, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still participating in the hunt. This balanced approach allows me to adapt to the current situation and increases my chances of survival without competing too aggressively with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively low, and the number of wolves is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment."
