By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still taking advantage of the available prey. This approach increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",

However, with the recent decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still secure food while also considering the competition from other wolves. A theta of 0.60 allows me to hunt effectively without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. By increasing my intensity to 0.75, I can take advantage of the higher prey availability while still conserving some energy for future hunts, as the wolf population remains stable.",
