            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because with the number of sheep increasing slightly and the wolf population stable, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still taking advantage of the available prey. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the number of wolves. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively when necessary. This balance helps ensure my survival in a stable environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, and the number of wolves is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with 37.53 sheep and 17 wolves, the competition is significant. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while conserving energy, as the sheep population is still relatively high. This allows me to adapt to the situation without overexerting myself, ensuring my survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the wolf population is increasing. By adjusting my hunting intensity to a moderate level, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and with other wolves hunting at maximum intensity, it may be wise to conserve energy and avoid competition. A lower intensity allows me to be strategic and wait for the right moment to hunt, ensuring my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased slightly, indicating more food availability. However, the number of wolves remains the same, which means competition for food is still present. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while avoiding overexertion that could lead to unnecessary risks. This moderate approach helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means food is becoming scarcer.

By increasing my hunting intensity, I can improve my chances of securing a meal while still being mindful of the need to conserve energy. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased slightly, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.65, I can conserve energy while still participating in hunts, allowing me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself. This balance helps ensure my survival while still contributing to the pack.",

This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating less food availability. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the hunt.
