By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.40, I can balance the need to hunt effectively while conserving energy for future hunts, ensuring my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making them more scarce. With an increase in the wolf population, hunting at a higher intensity will improve my chances of securing food while still being mindful of the competition. A theta of 0.60 balances the need for food with the risk of overexertion.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise. This balance increases my chances of survival in a competitive environment.",

However, I don't want to overexert myself and risk depleting the sheep population too quickly, which could lead to future scarcity. A theta of 0.60 strikes a balance between ensuring I get enough food while being mindful of the overall ecosystem.",

With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts. This strategy increases my chances of survival by avoiding competition with other wolves for limited prey.",

By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and ensure my survival.",

This way, I can still secure enough food without risking my survival in a more competitive environment.",

This way, I can still secure food while conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition is fierce, and I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can catch enough food while conserving energy.
