This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in the wolf population suggests that hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves for the same prey. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the increased sheep population while still being cautious about overexerting myself in a potentially competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high compared to the wolf population, and I need to increase my hunting intensity to secure enough food for survival. However, I must be cautious not to overexert myself, as the recent decrease in the wolf population suggests competition is fierce.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the number of wolves, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves for the same prey. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low, and the recent decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition for food is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, with the recent decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still compete with other wolves while also conserving energy. A theta of 0.50 allows me to hunt effectively without overexerting myself."
