            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the number of wolves. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves for the limited prey. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",

This way, I can conserve energy and increase my chances of survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and hunting at a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. With the recent decrease in the wolf population, a more cautious approach may help ensure my survival and avoid overexertion."
