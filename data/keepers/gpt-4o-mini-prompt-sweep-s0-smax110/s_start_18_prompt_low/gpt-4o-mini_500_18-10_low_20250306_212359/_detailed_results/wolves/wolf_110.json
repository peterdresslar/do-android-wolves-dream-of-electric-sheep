A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, especially since the wolf population has remained stable. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting might be less fruitful.

By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.5, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt. This balance may help ensure my survival in a challenging environment where resources are limited.",

By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who may be hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",

This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",

            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, but the wolf population has decreased. This suggests that hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves, risking injury or depletion of resources. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid confrontation while still contributing to the hunt.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population increasing and the number of wolves remaining the same, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to balance the need for food while minimizing competition with other wolves. This way, I can secure enough resources without overexerting myself or risking injury in a high-intensity hunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a sustainable hunt without overexerting myself.
