By increasing my hunting intensity from 0.45 to 0.55, I can improve my chances of catching enough prey while still being cautious, as the competition with other wolves remains. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because with the current number of sheep and wolves, hunting at a slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective. The sheep population is relatively stable, and with other wolves also hunting, a moderate approach may increase my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
