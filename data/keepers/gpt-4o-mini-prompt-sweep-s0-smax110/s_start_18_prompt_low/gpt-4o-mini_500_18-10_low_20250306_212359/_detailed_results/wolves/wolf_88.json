            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the number of wolves. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 12 wolves competing for food, a moderate increase in hunting intensity will allow me to secure enough resources without overexerting myself. This balance helps ensure my survival while still being cautious of the competition.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid overexerting myself while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased significantly, which means competition for food will be higher. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, allowing me to survive longer in this environment where sheep are still present but not abundant.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity. By increasing my theta from 0.30 to 0.45, I can take advantage of the sheep population while still conserving energy and avoiding overexertion, which is crucial for my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can take advantage of the abundant food while still being cautious, as the recent increase in wolves suggests competition for resources is rising. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher. With fewer sheep available, hunting at a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because with 49.26 sheep and 16 wolves, the competition for food is still significant. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
