            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, with the number of wolves decreasing, I need to balance my efforts to ensure I can still catch enough prey without exhausting myself or competing too fiercely with the remaining wolves. A moderate intensity allows me to be effective while conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 8 wolves competing for food, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to overexertion and potential failure. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because with the decrease in the wolf population, I need to be more competitive in hunting to ensure my survival. The increase in sheep provides an opportunity to hunt more effectively, so raising my intensity to 0.60 allows me to balance the need for food while still being cautious about overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, indicating more food availability. However, the number of wolves has remained the same, which means competition for food is still present. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can take advantage of the higher sheep numbers while still being cautious about the competition from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the number of wolves. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if needed.
