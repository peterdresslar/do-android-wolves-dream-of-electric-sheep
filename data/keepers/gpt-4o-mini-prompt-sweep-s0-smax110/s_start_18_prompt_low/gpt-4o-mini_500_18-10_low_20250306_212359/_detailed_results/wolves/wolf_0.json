            "I chose this theta because with 18 sheep and 10 wolves, the competition for food is high. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy, as I don't want to exhaust myself if the hunt is unsuccessful. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the number of sheep increasing and the wolf population remaining stable, I can afford to hunt at a moderate intensity. This allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive in the hunt. A lower intensity reduces the risk of overexertion and potential injury, which is crucial for my survival."
