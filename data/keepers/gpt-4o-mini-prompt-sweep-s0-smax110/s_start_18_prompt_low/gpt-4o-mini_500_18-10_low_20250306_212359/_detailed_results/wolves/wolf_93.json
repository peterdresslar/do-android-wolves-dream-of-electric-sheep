            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the wolf population is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still contributing to the hunt when necessary. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 17 wolves competing for food, a moderate increase in hunting intensity will improve my chances of catching prey without exhausting myself. This way, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion, ensuring my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because with the increase in the wolf population, competition for food is likely to intensify. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success. This strategy allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics and ensures my survival in a more competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with an increasing number of wolves, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and reduce my chances of securing food. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with others, while still contributing to the pack's overall success.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, competition for food is higher, so a lower intensity will help conserve energy while still allowing me to hunt effectively. This way, I can adapt to the current situation and ensure my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased slightly, indicating a potential scarcity of food. With an increase in the wolf population, competition for resources is likely to be higher. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.40, I can balance the need to secure food while avoiding overexertion that could lead to exhaustion or injury. This cautious approach allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics of the environment.",
