            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By lowering my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival in a crowded environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the number of wolves. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively when necessary. This strategy balances my need for food with the risk of overexertion in a stable environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with an increase in the number of wolves, competition for food is higher. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, and the number of wolves is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves for the dwindling sheep. This strategy allows me to survive longer while waiting for a more favorable situation.",
            "I chose this theta because with 49.26 sheep and 16 wolves, the competition is high. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while conserving energy, as the sheep population is still relatively high. This approach allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself, considering that other wolves are also hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the wolf population is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still contributing to the pack's success. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current environment and ensure my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 17 wolves competing for food, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to balance the risk of overexertion with the need to secure enough food for survival. By increasing my intensity slightly from my previous 0.40, I can take advantage of the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased slightly, but the wolf population has increased. By hunting at a higher intensity, I can increase my chances of securing food while still being mindful of the competition. A theta of 0.75 allows me to be aggressive enough to catch prey but not so intense that I exhaust myself or attract too much attention from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because with the increase in the wolf population, competition for food is rising. By reducing my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
