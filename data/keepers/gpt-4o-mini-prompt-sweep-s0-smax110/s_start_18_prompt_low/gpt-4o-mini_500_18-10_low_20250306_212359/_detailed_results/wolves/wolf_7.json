This balance allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive.",
            "I chose this theta because with the number of sheep increasing and wolves remaining constant, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective. This way, I can adapt to the changing environment and ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and the recent decrease in the wolf population suggests competition for food is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. With fewer wolves around, a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive in the hunt. This balance helps ensure my survival in a changing environment.",
