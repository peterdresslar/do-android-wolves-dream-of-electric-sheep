This approach allows me to adapt to the current situation while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the number of wolves, and hunting at a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's survival. This strategy may help avoid overhunting and ensure that I can sustain myself in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, and the wolf population has decreased. This suggests a favorable hunting environment where I can afford to increase my intensity without risking overexertion. A theta of 0.50 allows me to balance the need for food while conserving energy, as I still need to be cautious of other wolves competing for the same resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the number of wolves, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct confrontation, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still being cautious. This allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself, ensuring my survival in a competitive landscape."
