            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. With more wolves in the area, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt, ensuring my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the stable number of wolves. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased slightly, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of successfully catching prey while still conserving energy compared to maximum intensity. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased slightly, indicating that food may be scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity from 0.60 to 0.75, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a potentially competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means food is becoming scarcer. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's efforts. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting might be more challenging. By increasing my intensity to 0.75, I can maximize my chances of a successful hunt while still conserving energy for future needs. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the wolf population is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively low, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to overexploitation of the resource. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and ensure my survival while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 35.18, and with 20 wolves, there's enough competition to warrant a moderate hunting intensity. By increasing my intensity slightly from my previous 0.40, I can improve my chances of securing food while still being cautious not to overexert myself, given the stable number of wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating less food availability. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
