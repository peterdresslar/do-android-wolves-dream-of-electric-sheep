            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.25, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and increases my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 12 wolves competing for food, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in securing a meal. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population increasing and the number of wolves remaining stable, I need to balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion. A slightly higher intensity than before allows me to take advantage of the growing sheep numbers while still being cautious about competition from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because with an increase in the wolf population, competition for food is rising. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival in a crowded environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased slightly, which presents a good opportunity for hunting. By increasing my intensity to 0.70, I can take advantage of the higher sheep numbers while still conserving some energy in case the situation changes. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival in a crowded environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a more moderate hunting intensity.
