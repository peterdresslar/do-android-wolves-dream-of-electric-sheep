            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. This balance increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased slightly, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of securing food while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival as the competition remains constant with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.6, I can conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This allows me to adapt to the current situation and increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can maximize my chances of securing enough food while still being mindful of the risks involved in overexerting myself. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.5, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This balanced approach increases my chances of survival in a declining population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the number of wolves, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves for the same prey. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid unnecessary confrontations, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. Given that the wolf population has decreased, a moderate intensity allows me to balance the need for food while conserving energy for future hunts. This approach increases my chances of survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of securing food while still being mindful of the dwindling sheep population. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a competitive situation.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. With the recent decrease in the wolf population, it's wise to conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves. A moderate intensity allows me to hunt effectively while ensuring my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population increasing and the number of wolves remaining stable, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can secure enough food without overexerting myself. A theta of 0.70 allows me to hunt effectively while conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. With the recent decrease in the wolf population, it",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, but the wolf population has decreased. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still taking advantage of the available prey. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, with the decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still secure food while not overexerting myself. A theta of 0.50 allows me to hunt effectively without risking too much energy or attracting too much attention from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. By increasing my intensity to 0.70, I can take advantage of the higher prey availability while still being cautious, as the wolf population remains the same. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself."
