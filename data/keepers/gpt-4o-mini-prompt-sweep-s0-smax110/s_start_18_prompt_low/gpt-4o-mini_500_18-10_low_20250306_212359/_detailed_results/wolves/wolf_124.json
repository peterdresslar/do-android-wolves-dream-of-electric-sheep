            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. With more wolves in the area, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and overexertion without a guarantee of success. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and increase my chances of survival while still participating in the hunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the stable number of wolves. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the available prey while still conserving energy and avoiding overexertion. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 18 wolves competing for food, a slightly increased hunting intensity will improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means food is becoming scarcer. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and increase my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased slightly, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy, as the wolf population has remained stable. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population decreasing, hunting at full intensity might not be sustainable. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and adapt to the changing environment while still contributing to the pack's needs.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my intensity to 0.75, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival as the competition with other wolves remains constant.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that food is becoming scarcer. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and increases my chances of survival without competing too aggressively with other wolves."
