However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests competition is high, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to overexertion or conflict with other wolves. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still taking advantage of the available prey.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition is less intense, allowing me to hunt at a moderate intensity without risking overexertion. This balance helps ensure my survival while still taking advantage of the available prey.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the number of wolves, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves for the same prey.
