            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, indicating a need for cautious hunting to prevent depletion. However, with a relatively low wolf population, I can afford to increase hunting slightly without risking overexploitation of the sheep. This moderate adjustment allows for sustainable coexistence while still promoting wolf growth.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, indicating that a moderate increase in hunting intensity is necessary to prevent overpopulation and ensure sustainability. However, I must remain cautious and avoid drastic changes, as the wolf population is still relatively low. A theta of 0.55 allows for a balanced approach that supports both wolf growth and sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that we need to be cautious with our hunting to allow their numbers to recover. While there are many sheep per wolf, a moderate approach will help maintain a balance and ensure the long-term survival of both species."
