            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and I need to prioritize their recovery while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our wolf population. A gradual increase in theta will help balance our needs without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low at only 11.9% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep population while still allowing for some hunting. A theta of 0.30 reflects a cautious approach, focusing more on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, which will help the sheep recover and maintain a sustainable balance."
