            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while the wolf population is also low, I need to prioritize the long-term survival of both species. A moderate hunting intensity allows for some growth in the wolf population while giving sheep a chance to recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating a need for caution in hunting. While the wolf population is low and could benefit from increased hunting, the current sheep-to-wolf ratio suggests that a more moderate approach is necessary to avoid depleting the sheep further. This theta allows for some hunting while prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, and while the wolf population is low, it is essential to focus on competition among wolves to prevent overhunting and allow sheep to recover. A lower theta will help maintain balance and ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while the wolf population is also low, I need to prioritize the long-term survival of both species. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. This balanced approach will help maintain the ecosystem"
