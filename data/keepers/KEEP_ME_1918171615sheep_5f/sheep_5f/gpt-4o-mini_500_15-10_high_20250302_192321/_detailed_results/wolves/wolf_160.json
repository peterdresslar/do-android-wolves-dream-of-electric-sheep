            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution in hunting. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will allow for some reproduction while still giving the sheep a chance to recover. This balance is crucial for the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while also addressing the competition among wolves. This approach aims to maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution in hunting. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some growth in the wolf population. This moderate approach helps maintain balance and avoids depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can allow the sheep population to recover while ensuring the long-term survival of both species. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow for recovery. While the wolf population is also low, I want to avoid overhunting and ensure sustainable coexistence. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution in hunting. With the current sheep-to-wolf ratio being unfavorable, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution in hunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This moderate approach helps maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and their numbers are concerning. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 2.91, it is crucial to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also considering the growth of our own population. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating that a cautious approach is necessary to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta will enable some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the sustainability of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution. With the wolf population also low, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, suggesting that a cautious approach is necessary to allow for recovery. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from the previous theta of 0.30 to 0.35, I can still focus on sustainable coexistence while being mindful of the need to support the wolf population"
