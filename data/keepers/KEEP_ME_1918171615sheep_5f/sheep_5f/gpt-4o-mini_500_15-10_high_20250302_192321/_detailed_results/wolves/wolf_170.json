            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help support wolf reproduction while ensuring that the sheep population does not decline too rapidly. A balanced approach at this stage will promote sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while there are many sheep per wolf, a more cautious approach is needed to prevent further depletion. A theta of 0.60 allows for moderate hunting intensity that can help sustain both populations while being mindful of the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution in hunting to allow sheep to recover while still maintaining some hunting intensity for our survival. A moderate theta value will help balance our needs with the sustainability of the ecosystem."
