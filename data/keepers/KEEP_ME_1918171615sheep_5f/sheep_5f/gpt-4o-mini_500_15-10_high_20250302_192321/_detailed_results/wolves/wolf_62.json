            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity, I can help sustain my pack while allowing the sheep population to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.2% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable at 0.24. With the wolf population being high, increasing competition among wolves is likely. Therefore, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while maintaining the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the high wolf population indicates increased competition. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance without risking a crash."
