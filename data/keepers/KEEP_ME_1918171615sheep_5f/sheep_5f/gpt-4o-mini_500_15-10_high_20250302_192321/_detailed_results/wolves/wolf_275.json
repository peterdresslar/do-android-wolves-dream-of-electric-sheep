            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.63, which is only 0.2% of its maximum capacity. With the wolf population at 65, the competition among wolves is high, and further hunting could deplete the sheep population even more. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we manage our numbers more sustainably.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and a cautious approach is necessary to allow for their recovery. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from the previous theta, I can still focus on competition with other wolves while being mindful of the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.00, which is just 0.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates a need for caution and a focus on allowing the sheep to recover. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both the sheep and the wolf population, while still being mindful of the competitive pressures from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and a cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from the previous theta, I can still support the wolf population while being mindful of the declining sheep numbers. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance without risking a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and while I want to ensure the survival of both wolves and sheep, I must prioritize caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate approach will help maintain a balance as the wolf population is currently low, and I can gradually increase hunting intensity if sheep numbers improve."
