            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while reducing pressure on our own population. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance and ensures long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is critically low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while reducing pressure on their dwindling numbers. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we manage our numbers more sustainably. This gradual adjustment will help maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. It is essential to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both species by preventing overhunting and promoting a more sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution in hunting. While the wolf population is relatively low, I want to avoid depleting the sheep further. A gradual increase in theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population."
