However, I must remain cautious and avoid drastic changes, as the wolf population is still relatively low. This balance allows for gradual growth in my pack while keeping the sheep population in check.",

A moderate increase allows for a balance between hunting and ensuring the sheep can recover.",

By lowering the hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep while still allowing for some competition among wolves."
