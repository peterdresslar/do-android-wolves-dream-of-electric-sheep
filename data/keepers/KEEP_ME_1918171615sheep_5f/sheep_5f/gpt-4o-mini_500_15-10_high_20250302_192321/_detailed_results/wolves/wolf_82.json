            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, indicating a need for moderate hunting to prevent overpopulation while still allowing for wolf growth. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring sustainability without risking a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with a low wolf population, there is an opportunity to increase hunting intensity to support our growth. However, I must be cautious to avoid over-depleting the sheep, so a moderate increase is appropriate.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, indicating a need for increased hunting to prevent overpopulation. However, the wolf population is low, so I must balance hunting intensity to allow for wolf growth while still managing the sheep numbers sustainably. A moderate theta of 0.55 allows for a cautious approach to hunting without risking a rapid decline in sheep or wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while there are many sheep per wolf, caution is necessary to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate approach allows for some hunting while still giving the sheep a chance to recover, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, while still allowing for some competition among wolves."
