            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, indicating that while I can increase my hunting intensity, I should do so cautiously to avoid depleting their numbers too quickly. A moderate theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still considering the long-term balance of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help support the growth of the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover without being overly depleted. A gradual increase in theta reflects the need for balance, as the current sheep-to-wolf ratio suggests that we can hunt more without jeopardizing the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high at 160.04, which allows for increased hunting intensity without risking immediate depletion. The wolf population is low, and with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 26.67, we can sustainably increase our hunting efforts to support our growth while still being mindful of the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, indicating that a moderate increase in hunting intensity is necessary to prevent overpopulation and ensure sustainability. However, I must remain cautious and avoid drastic changes, as the wolf population is still low and requires careful management."
