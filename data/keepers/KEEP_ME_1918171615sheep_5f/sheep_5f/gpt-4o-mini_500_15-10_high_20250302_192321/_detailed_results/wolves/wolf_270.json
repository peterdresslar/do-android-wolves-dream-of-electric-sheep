            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is unsustainable. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing the competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem and ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on reducing competition among wolves, which is necessary given our high population. This approach aims to create a more sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.01, which is just 0.1% of its maximum capacity. With the wolf population at 40, the competition among wolves is likely to increase, making it essential to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure and give the sheep a chance to rebound, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and a cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash."
