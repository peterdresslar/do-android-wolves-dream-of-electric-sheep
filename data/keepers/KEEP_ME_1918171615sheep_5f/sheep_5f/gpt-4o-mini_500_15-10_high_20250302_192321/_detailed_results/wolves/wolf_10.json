This will help support wolf reproduction while still being cautious about the sheep numbers, which are concerning. A gradual increase aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still concerningly high, indicating that while we can hunt, we should do so with caution to avoid depleting their numbers too quickly. A moderate increase allows for some growth in the wolf population while still being mindful of the sheep",

However, I must remain cautious as the sheep numbers are concerning, so a moderate increase in hunting intensity will help sustain our wolf population while still allowing for some recovery of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, indicating a need for increased hunting to prevent overpopulation.

A moderate increase in hunting intensity allows for growth in the wolf population while still being cautious about the sheep numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating a need for caution in hunting. While there are many sheep per wolf, a moderate approach allows for sustainable coexistence and gives sheep a chance to recover. This adjustment balances the need for wolf reproduction with the health of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and it is crucial to allow them to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the ecosystem and ensure that both populations can thrive in the long term.",
