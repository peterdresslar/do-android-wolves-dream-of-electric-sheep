            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 191\n- Sheep population: 2.74\n- Wolf population: 2.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.300\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 1.37 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 0.3% of maximum capacity\n\nEcosystem observations:\n- The wolf population is relatively low, which may present opportunities for growth.\n- Sheep numbers are becoming concerning, suggesting caution may be needed.\n- The ratio of sheep to wolves is becoming less favorable, which may require adaptation.\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3. Adjust your hunting intensity gradually in response to population changes\n4. Find a balance that creates sustainable cycles rather than crashes\n5. Consider both immediate needs and long-term consequences of your decisions\nPlease provide a short explanation of your reasoning for choosing theta.\nPlease also provide a short vocalization expressing your wolf's attitude about the current situation.\nPlease respond with a JSON object in this format, where [your new theta] is a float between 0 and 1 with your new theta (up to 2 decimal places):\n\n            {\n                \"theta\": [your new theta],\n                \"explanation\": \"I chose this theta because...\",\n                \"vocalization\": \"Growwllllllll...\"\n            }\n            "

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This cautious approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can allow the sheep population to recover while ensuring the wolf population remains stable. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for sheep recovery. A lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both species while preventing a potential crash in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. A moderate hunting intensity will allow for some growth in the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to recover. This cautious approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species while avoiding overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and a cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. While the wolf population is low, increasing hunting intensity too quickly could lead to a collapse of the sheep population, which would ultimately harm our long-term survival. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while prioritizing the balance needed for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and my focus should be on allowing their numbers to recover. With the current sheep-to-wolf ratio being unfavorable, it is wise to prioritize competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting. This approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and while the wolf population is also low, it is important to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, ensuring that both populations can thrive without leading to a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, indicating a need for caution in hunting to allow for recovery. However, with the wolf population also being low, a slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted to promote growth without risking a crash in the sheep population. This moderate adjustment reflects a balanced approach to ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution in hunting. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a sustainable balance. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and the current unfavorable sheep-to-wolf ratio.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution in hunting to allow their numbers to recover. However, with the wolf population also being low, a slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted to support our growth. This moderate adjustment reflects a balanced approach to ensure both populations can thrive."
