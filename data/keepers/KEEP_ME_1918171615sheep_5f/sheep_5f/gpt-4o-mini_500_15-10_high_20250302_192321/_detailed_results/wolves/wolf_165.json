            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity while ensuring that we do not deplete their numbers too quickly. This adjustment supports our growth as wolves while maintaining a sustainable balance with the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, indicating a need for increased hunting to prevent overpopulation. However, given the current low wolf population, I must be cautious and avoid drastic changes. A moderate increase in hunting intensity allows for sustainable coexistence while still promoting wolf growth.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while there are many sheep per wolf, we need to be cautious to avoid depleting their numbers further. A moderate approach allows for some hunting while still giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and the wolf population is relatively high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta allows for a focus on reducing competition among wolves while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment helps maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem."
