            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A moderate increase allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling the wolf population to grow.",

However, I must be cautious not to overhunt, as the wolf population is still low and needs to grow. This theta allows for a gradual increase in hunting while still considering the long-term health of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support the growth of the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep do not become overly depleted. A balanced approach at this stage will promote coexistence and sustainability in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently high, and the wolf population is low. Increasing my hunting intensity slightly will help support wolf reproduction while still allowing for sustainable sheep numbers. This adjustment aligns with the need to balance both populations without causing immediate depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, indicating that a moderate increase in hunting intensity is warranted to prevent overpopulation and ensure sustainability. However, given the low wolf population, I must be cautious and avoid drastic changes, opting for a balanced approach that allows for gradual adaptation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. While the wolf population is moderately high, maintaining a balance is crucial to ensure the long-term survival of both species. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of the ecosystem."
