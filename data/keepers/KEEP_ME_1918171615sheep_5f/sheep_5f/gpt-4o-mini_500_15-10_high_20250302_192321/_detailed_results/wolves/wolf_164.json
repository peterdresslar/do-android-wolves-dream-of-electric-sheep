            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, allowing for increased hunting intensity without immediate risk of depletion. However, I must remain cautious as the wolf population is low, and I want to ensure sustainable coexistence. A moderate increase in hunting will help support wolf reproduction while still allowing for the sheep population to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity while also being cautious about the potential depletion of sheep. This balance will help support the growth of the wolf population without jeopardizing the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high at 160.04, which allows for increased hunting intensity without risking immediate depletion. With a low wolf population of 6.00, there is an opportunity for growth, and a moderate increase in hunting can help sustain our numbers while still allowing for sheep recovery in the long term. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that we need to be cautious with our hunting to allow their numbers to recover. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of both our pack and the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. A moderate hunting intensity will allow sheep to recover while preventing overcompetition among wolves. This approach promotes long-term sustainability."
