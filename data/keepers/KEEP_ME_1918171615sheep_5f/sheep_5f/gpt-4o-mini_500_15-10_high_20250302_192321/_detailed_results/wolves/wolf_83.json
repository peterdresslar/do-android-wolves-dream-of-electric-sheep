            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, indicating a need for increased hunting to ensure sustainability. However, given the low wolf population and the need to avoid overexploitation of sheep, a moderate increase in hunting intensity allows for a balanced approach that supports both wolf growth and sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating a need for caution in hunting. However, with a high sheep-to-wolf ratio, there is potential for sustainable hunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for more hunting while still being mindful of the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that we need to prioritize their recovery. A lower theta will allow us to compete with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to rebound, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is concerningly low, and the wolf population is relatively high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and prioritizes long-term sustainability."
