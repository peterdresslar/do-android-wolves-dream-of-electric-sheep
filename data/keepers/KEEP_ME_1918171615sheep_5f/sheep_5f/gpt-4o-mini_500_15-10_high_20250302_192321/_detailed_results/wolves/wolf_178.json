            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and a more cautious approach is needed to allow their numbers to recover. While the wolf population is moderately high, maintaining a balance is crucial for the long-term survival of both species. A gradual reduction in hunting intensity will help stabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A lower theta allows for a focus on reducing competition among wolves while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance in the ecosystem without risking a crash."
