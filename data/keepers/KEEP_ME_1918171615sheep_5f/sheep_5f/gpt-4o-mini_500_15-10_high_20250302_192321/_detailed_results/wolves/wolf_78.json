            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, indicating a need for caution in hunting to allow their numbers to recover. At the same time, the wolf population is high, suggesting that I should not completely abandon hunting. A moderate theta of 0.5 strikes a balance between competing with other wolves and allowing the sheep population to stabilize, promoting long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep to recover. This approach will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This cautious approach aligns with the need for long-term sustainability in our ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep population by reducing hunting intensity. This cautious approach allows for a potential rebound in sheep numbers while maintaining the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This adjustment reflects the need to balance immediate hunting pressures with the long-term sustainability of both species.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted to ensure the wolf population can sustain itself, but I must remain cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. This gradual adjustment allows for recovery while still considering the long-term balance.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution in hunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a balance and adapting to the current state of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 4.08, it is crucial to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while still allowing for some competition among wolves.",
