A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring sustainability without risking a crash in either population.",

This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still being cautious to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A moderate increase to 0.60 reflects a balance between hunting and ensuring the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, indicating a need for cautious hunting to prevent overpopulation. However, with a low wolf population, I want to allow for some hunting to support our growth. A moderate adjustment to 0.55 balances the need for sustainable coexistence while still allowing for some increase in wolf numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently high, allowing for increased hunting intensity without immediate risk to their numbers. This will help support the growth of the wolf population while still maintaining a balance. A moderate increase in hunting will allow us to take advantage of the current sheep abundance while being cautious not to deplete their numbers too quickly.",

A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain its health. This approach aligns with the need for a sustainable balance in the ecosystem."
