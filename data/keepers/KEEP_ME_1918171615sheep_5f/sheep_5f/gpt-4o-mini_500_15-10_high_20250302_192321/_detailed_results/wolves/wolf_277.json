            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their collapse. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing the competition with other wolves. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and a cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. With the sheep-to-wolf ratio becoming less favorable, it is important to focus on competition with other wolves rather than hunting intensively, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their extinction. Maintaining a low theta allows for the sheep to recover while ensuring the wolf population does not face immediate competition pressures.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.00, which is just 0.1% of its maximum capacity. Increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in sheep numbers, jeopardizing the long-term survival of both species. Maintaining a low theta allows for sheep recovery while also addressing the unfavorable sheep-to-wolf ratio.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and a cautious approach is necessary to allow them to recover. While I need to maintain a healthy wolf population, focusing on competition with other wolves will help stabilize our numbers without further depleting the sheep. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. A lower theta allows for a focus on competition among wolves, which can help stabilize the wolf population while giving sheep a chance to recover. This cautious approach aligns with the need for long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and while I want to ensure the survival of my pack, I must prioritize the recovery of the sheep. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring a more sustainable balance."
