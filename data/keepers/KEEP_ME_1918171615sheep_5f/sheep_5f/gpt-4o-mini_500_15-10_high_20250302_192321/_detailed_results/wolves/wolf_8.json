By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep population to recover while ensuring our pack remains healthy. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while the wolf population is also low, a cautious approach is necessary to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta will enable some hunting while still prioritizing the sustainability of both populations.",
