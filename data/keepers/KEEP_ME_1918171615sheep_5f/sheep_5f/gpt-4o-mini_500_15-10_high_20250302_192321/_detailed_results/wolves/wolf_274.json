            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, which necessitates a cautious approach to allow for recovery. With the wolf population being quite high, focusing on competition among wolves rather than intense hunting will help prevent further depletion of the sheep and promote a more sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.01, which is just 0.1% of its maximum capacity. With the wolf population at 40, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable at 0.03 sheep per wolf. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent further depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This cautious approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. A lower theta allows for a focus on competition with other wolves, which can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to their collapse. Maintaining a low theta allows for the possibility of sheep recovery while also considering the current unfavorable sheep-to-wolf ratio."
