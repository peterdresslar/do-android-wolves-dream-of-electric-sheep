            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. A lower theta allows for a focus on competition among wolves, which can help stabilize our population while giving sheep a chance to recover. Gradually adjusting my hunting intensity is essential to avoid further depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance without risking a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. A gradual decrease in theta will help stabilize the ecosystem without causing sudden shifts."
