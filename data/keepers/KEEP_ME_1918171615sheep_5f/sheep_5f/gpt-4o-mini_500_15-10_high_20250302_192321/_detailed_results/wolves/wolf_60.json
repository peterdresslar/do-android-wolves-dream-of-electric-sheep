            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution in hunting. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover gradually. This approach balances the immediate need for food with the long-term sustainability of both species.",

A moderate theta value will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition among wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. A moderate approach will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain its strength. This balance is essential for the long-term survival of both species."
