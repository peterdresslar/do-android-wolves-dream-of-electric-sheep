However, I want to remain cautious given the current trends and the potential for sheep numbers to decline. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for growth in the wolf population while still being mindful of the sheep",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and a more cautious approach is needed to allow their numbers to recover. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while maintaining a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure on the sheep, allowing their numbers to recover while we focus on maintaining our pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need to focus on reducing competition among wolves while allowing the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting."
