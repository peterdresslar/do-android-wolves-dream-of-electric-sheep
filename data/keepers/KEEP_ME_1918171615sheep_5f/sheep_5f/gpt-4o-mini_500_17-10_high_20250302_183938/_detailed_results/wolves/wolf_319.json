            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity, allowing the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we are at risk of depleting our prey. By reducing hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while managing the competition among wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. Maintaining a low hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover while we focus on competition among wolves. This cautious approach supports long-term sustainability for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. A gradual reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain itself. This approach aligns with the wisdom of adapting to changing conditions without making sudden changes."
