            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for a more cautious approach to hunting. A theta of 0.75 allows for increased hunting intensity to support reproduction while still being mindful of the declining sheep numbers. This balance aims to prevent over-depletion of the sheep population and ensures long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution in hunting. While my previous theta of 0.75 was effective, the current sheep-to-wolf ratio suggests that a more moderate approach is necessary to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain its health. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover and stabilize, ensuring long-term survival for both species. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem."
