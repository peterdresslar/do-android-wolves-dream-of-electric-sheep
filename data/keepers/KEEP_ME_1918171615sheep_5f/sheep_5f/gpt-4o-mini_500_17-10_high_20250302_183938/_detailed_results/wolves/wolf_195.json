A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain itself. This approach balances the immediate need for food with the long-term sustainability of both species.",

By reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing the competition among wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. A slight increase in hunting intensity is necessary to support wolf reproduction, but I must remain cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. This gradual adjustment allows for a more sustainable balance.",
