            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for some increased hunting intensity without risking a significant decline in their numbers. This adjustment supports my pack",

A moderate theta value will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity, allowing the sheep to recover while we manage our numbers more sustainably. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a balance in the ecosystem."
