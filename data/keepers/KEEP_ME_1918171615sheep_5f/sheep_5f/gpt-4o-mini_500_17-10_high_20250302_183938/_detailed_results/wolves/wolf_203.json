            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help support the growth of the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep do not become too depleted. A gradual increase to 0.55 reflects a balanced approach, promoting coexistence and sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating a need for caution in hunting. While there are many sheep per wolf, I want to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term balance of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while there are many sheep per wolf, I must prioritize the long-term survival of both species. A slight reduction in hunting intensity allows for sheep recovery while still enabling some hunting to support the wolf population."
