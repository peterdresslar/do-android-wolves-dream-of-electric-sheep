            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 61\n- Sheep population: 20.81\n- Wolf population: 5.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.300\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 4.16 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 2.1% of maximum capacity\n\nEcosystem observations:\n- The wolf population is relatively low, which may present opportunities for growth.\n- Sheep numbers are becoming concerning, suggesting caution may be needed.\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution in hunting to allow sheep to recover. A moderate theta value will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need to focus on competition among wolves rather than intense hunting. This will allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a healthier balance within the wolf pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.3% of its maximum capacity, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. This cautious approach will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This gradual adjustment helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain our population while allowing the sheep to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of adapting to changing conditions without risking a drastic decline in sheep numbers.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution in hunting. While the wolf population is also low, I want to avoid depleting the sheep further. A gradual increase in theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution in hunting. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also considering the growth potential of the wolf population. This balance is crucial for the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution in hunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This balanced approach helps maintain the delicate ecosystem without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while the wolf population is also low, it is crucial to prioritize the recovery of the sheep. A lower theta allows for competition among wolves, which can help stabilize our numbers while giving the sheep a chance to rebound.
