While there are many sheep per wolf, the current state suggests a need for a balanced approach to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining our population. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for some hunting without risking a drastic decline in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating a need for caution in hunting. A moderate approach will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain its health. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of gradual changes and the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and it is crucial to prioritize their recovery to ensure long-term sustainability. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help stabilize the ecosystem and allow sheep numbers to rebound."
