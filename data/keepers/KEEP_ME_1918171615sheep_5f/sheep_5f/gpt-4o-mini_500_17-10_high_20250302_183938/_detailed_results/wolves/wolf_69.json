            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A moderate theta allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some growth in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, indicating a need for increased hunting to prevent overpopulation. However, given the low wolf population, I must be cautious and avoid drastic changes. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for more hunting while still considering the long-term sustainability of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help support wolf reproduction while also being mindful of the sheep population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with a low wolf population, there is an opportunity to increase hunting intensity without risking immediate depletion of sheep. A moderate increase to 0.60 allows for sustainable hunting while still considering the long-term balance needed for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, indicating a need for cautious hunting to prevent overpopulation. However, with a relatively low wolf population, I want to ensure we can sustain our numbers while allowing the sheep to recover. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without risking depletion of either population."
