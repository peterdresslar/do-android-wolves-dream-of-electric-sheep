A moderate increase allows for sustainable coexistence while also enabling the wolf population to grow.",

A moderate increase in hunting intensity will allow for some growth in the wolf population while still being cautious about depleting the sheep. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",

However, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep too quickly, as the wolf population is still low. A gradual adjustment allows for a balance between hunting and competing with other wolves.",

This will help support wolf reproduction while still being cautious about the sheep numbers, ensuring we do not deplete their population too quickly.",

However, with the wolf population being relatively low, I want to avoid overexploitation of the sheep and ensure our pack can grow sustainably.
