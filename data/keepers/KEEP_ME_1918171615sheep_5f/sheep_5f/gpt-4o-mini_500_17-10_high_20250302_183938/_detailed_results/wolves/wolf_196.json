            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep. A lower theta will allow the sheep to stabilize and grow, ensuring a sustainable food source for the future while preventing overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent further depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution in hunting. With the wolf population also relatively low, a moderate approach allows for some hunting while also giving sheep a chance to recover. This balance is essential for the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, which requires a cautious approach to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance between hunting and ensuring the sheep can sustain their numbers, while also allowing for some growth in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution in hunting. With the wolf population also being relatively low, it is important to focus on competition among wolves to allow for recovery of both populations. A lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating that a cautious approach is necessary to allow for recovery. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from my previous theta, I can take advantage of the current low wolf population while still prioritizing the long-term health of the sheep. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep do not become too depleted.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. With the current sheep-to-wolf ratio becoming less favorable, focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution in hunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while the wolf population is also low, it is crucial to allow the sheep to recover. A lower hunting intensity will help maintain the delicate balance in the ecosystem, ensuring both species can thrive in the long term.",
