            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is quite low at 19.19, which indicates a need for caution in hunting to allow their numbers to recover. However, with the wolf population being high at 55, a moderate increase in hunting intensity is justified to ensure our pack can sustain itself without depleting the sheep too quickly. This value strikes a balance between competing with other wolves and allowing the sheep population to stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain its health. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments to ensure long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating that we need to prioritize their recovery. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, we can allow the sheep to stabilize and gradually increase their numbers, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem."
