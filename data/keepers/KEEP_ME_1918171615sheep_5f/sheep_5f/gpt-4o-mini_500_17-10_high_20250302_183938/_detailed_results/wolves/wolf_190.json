To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",

A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves, ensuring that we do not deplete the sheep further. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution in hunting. With the wolf population also relatively low, a moderate approach allows for some hunting while still enabling sheep recovery. This balance helps ensure the long-term survival of both species."
