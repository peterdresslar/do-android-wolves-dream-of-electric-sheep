            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution.

This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This cautious approach aligns with the need for long-term survival and balance in the ecosystem.",

By reducing hunting intensity, I can help ensure that the sheep have a chance to rebound while still allowing for some competition among wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
