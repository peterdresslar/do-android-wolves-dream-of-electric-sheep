            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating that competition among wolves is increasing. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we manage our numbers more sustainably. This gradual adjustment will help prevent a crash in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a balance in the wolf population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments to ensure long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. A gradual decrease in theta will help stabilize the ecosystem without causing sudden shifts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and a cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to stabilize. This aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep. A lower theta will allow for competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to rebound, ensuring long-term sustainability for both populations."
