            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 4.33, it is crucial to prioritize the recovery of the sheep. A moderate hunting intensity will allow for some reproduction among wolves while giving sheep a chance to stabilize and grow. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 3.56, it indicates that we need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep. A moderate hunting intensity allows for some hunting while giving sheep a chance to rebound, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while preventing overhunting, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem."
