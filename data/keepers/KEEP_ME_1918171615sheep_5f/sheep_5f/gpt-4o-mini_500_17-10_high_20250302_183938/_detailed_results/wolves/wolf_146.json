            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and the wolf population is moderately high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while still considering the competition among wolves. A gradual adjustment helps maintain balance without risking a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and with a high wolf population, competition is increasing. A lower theta allows for a focus on reducing competition among wolves while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance and ensures the long-term survival of both species."
