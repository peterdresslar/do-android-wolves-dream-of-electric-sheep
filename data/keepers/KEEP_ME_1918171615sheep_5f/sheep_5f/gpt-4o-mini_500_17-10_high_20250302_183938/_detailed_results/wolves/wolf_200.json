            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, indicating a need for cautious hunting to prevent overpopulation. However, with a low wolf population, I want to ensure we can grow while still allowing the sheep to recover. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach that supports both our needs and the sustainability of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, indicating that a moderate increase in hunting intensity is necessary to prevent overpopulation and ensure sustainable coexistence. However, given the low wolf population, I must be cautious and avoid drastic changes, allowing for gradual adjustments to maintain balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help support wolf reproduction while ensuring that the sheep population does not decline too rapidly. A balanced approach is necessary to maintain the delicate ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently high relative to the wolf population, allowing for increased hunting without immediate risk of depletion. However, I must remain cautious as the sheep numbers are concerning, so a moderate increase in hunting intensity will help support wolf reproduction while still allowing for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while there are many sheep per wolf, I need to prioritize the long-term survival of both species. A moderate hunting intensity allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while giving sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is relatively high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta allows for a focus on reducing competition and giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species."
