            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and the wolf population is relatively high, indicating a need for caution in hunting. A moderate theta allows for some hunting to support reproduction while also giving sheep a chance to recover. This balance is crucial for the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain their numbers. This approach supports long-term sustainability and avoids the risk of depleting the sheep population further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is quite low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta allows for a focus on reducing competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment will help maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
